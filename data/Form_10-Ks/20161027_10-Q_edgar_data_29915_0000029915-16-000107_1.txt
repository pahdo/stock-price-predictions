The Dow Chemical Company and Subsidiaries 

Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as otherwise noted by the context, the terms "Company" or "Dow" as used herein mean The Dow Chemical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report including, without limitation, the following sections:  Management's Discussion and Analysis,  and  Risk Factors.  These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   may,   opportunity,   outlook,   plan,   project,   should,   strategy,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely result  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  
    
  This document also contains statements about Dow's agreement to effect an all-stock, merger of equals strategic combination with E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") resulting in a new combined company ("DowDuPont") and then, subsequent to the merger, Dow and DuPont intend to pursue the separation of DowDuPont's agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through one or more tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the "Transaction"). Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements with respect to the Transaction, including (i) the completion of the proposed Transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the new combined company s operations and other conditions to the completion of the merger, (ii) the ability of Dow and DuPont to integrate the business successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies, risks and costs and pursuit and/or implementation of the potential separation, including anticipated timing, and any changes to the configuration of businesses included in the potential separation, if implemented, (iii) potential litigation relating to the proposed Transaction that could be instituted against Dow, DuPont or their respective directors, (iv) the risk that disruptions from the proposed Transaction will harm Dow s or DuPont s business, including current plans and operations, (v) the ability of Dow or DuPont to retain and hire key personnel, (vi) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the merger, (vii) uncertainty as to the long-term value of DowDuPont common stock, (viii) continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions, (ix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, (x) potential business uncertainty during the pendency of the merger that could affect Dow s and/or DuPont s economic performance, (xi) certain contractual restrictions that could be imposed on Dow and/or DuPont during the pendency of the merger that might impact Dow s or DuPont s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions and (xii) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as management s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed merger, are more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that is included in the registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-209869) that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed merger. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the registration statement on Form S-4 are, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Dow s or DuPont s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, credit rating or liquidity. Neither Dow nor DuPont assumes any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.    
    
  A detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Dow Chemical Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable laws.

Table of Contents 

NOTE   1     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  Basis of Presentation  
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of The Dow Chemical Company and its subsidiaries ( Dow  or the  Company ) were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which, in the opinion of management, are considered necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Updated Significant Accounting Policy 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  The local currency has been primarily used as the functional currency throughout the world. Translation gains and losses of those operations that use local currency as the functional currency are included in the consolidated balance sheets in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" ("AOCL"). For certain subsidiaries, the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. This occurs when the subsidiary operates in an economic environment where the products produced and sold are tied to U.S. dollar-denominated markets, or when the foreign subsidiary operates in a hyper-inflationary environment. Where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency, foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in income.

Adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-17. The Company elected to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis and, as a result, changes have been made to the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015. See Note   2   for additional information. In addition, a change was made to the prior year consolidated balance sheets to reclassify prepaid tax assets of   $293 million   to "Other current assets." A summary of the changes made to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015, is included in the following table: 

NOTE   2     RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis," which makes changes to both the variable interest model and voting interest model and eliminates the indefinite deferral of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 167, included in ASU 2010-10, for certain investment funds. All reporting entities that hold a variable interest in other legal entities had to re-evaluate their consolidation conclusions as well as disclosure requirements. This ASU was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption was permitted, including any interim period. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-05, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement," which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU was effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The change is reflected in "Deferred income tax assets" and "Deferred income tax liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets on a retrospective basis and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note   1   for additional information. 
    
  Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted as of   September 30, 2016    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date," which was issued in August 2015, revised the effective date for this ASU to annual and interim periods beginning on or after  
  
    10 

     Table of Contents  

December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, but not earlier than the original effective date of annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, for public entities. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board formed The Joint Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition ("TRG"), consisting of financial statement preparers, auditors and users, to seek feedback on potential issues related to the implementation of the new revenue standard. As a result of feedback from the TRG, the FASB has issued additional guidance to provide clarification, implementation guidance and practical expedients to address some of the challenges of implementation. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)," which is an amendment on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction. This amendment addresses issues to clarify the principal versus agent assessment and lead to more consistent application. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing," which contains amendments to the new revenue recognition standard on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The amendments related to identifying performance obligations clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable and allows entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of a contract. The licensing implementation amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which will determine whether revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," which provides clarity and implementation guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The new standards have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory," which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ("FIFO") or average cost. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out ("LIFO"). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," which requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance requires that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months and recognition, presentation and measurement in the financial statements will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. In addition, the new guidance will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged from current U.S. GAAP but does contain some targeted improvements to align with the new revenue recognition guidance issued in 2014. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and  
  
    11 

     Table of Contents  

classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted in any annual or interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued, and all amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments," which addresses diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows with respect to eight specific cash flow issues. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented, if practicable. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, and any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. All amendments must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory," which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings at the beginning period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted in the first interim period of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 

NOTE   3     RESTRUCTURING 
  2016 Restructuring  
  On June 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan that incorporates actions related to the recent ownership restructure of Dow Corning Corporation ("Dow Corning"). These actions, aligned with Dow s value growth and synergy targets, will result in a global workforce reduction of approximately   2,500   positions, with most of these positions resulting from synergies related to the Dow Corning transaction. These actions are expected to be completed during the next   two   years. 
    
  As a result of these actions, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of   $449 million   in the second quarter of 2016 consisting of severance charges of   $268 million  , asset write-downs and write-offs of   $153 million   and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of   $28 million  . The impact of these charges is shown as "Restructuring charges" in the consolidated statements of income and reflected in the Company's segment results as shown in the following table:  

Details regarding the components of the 2Q16 restructuring charge are discussed below: 
    
  Severance Costs 
  The restructuring charge includes severance of   $268 million   for the separation of approximately   2,500   employees under the terms of the Company's ongoing benefit arrangements, primarily by June 30, 2018. These costs were charged against Corporate. In the third quarter of 2016, severance of   $24 million   was paid, leaving a liability of   $244 million   for approximately   2,200   employees at   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Other Assets 
  The restructuring charges related to the write-down and write-off of assets in the second quarter of 2016 total   $153 million  . Details regarding the write-downs and write-offs are as follows: 

The Company recorded a charge of   $70 million   for asset write-downs and write-offs including the shutdown of an Energy   Water Solutions solar manufacturing facility in Midland, Michigan; the write-down of a solar facility in Milpitas, California; and, the write-off of capital projects and in-process research and development. The charge was reflected in the Infrastructure Solutions operating segment. The Midland facility was shut down in the third quarter of 2016.  

To enhance competitiveness and streamline costs associated with the ownership restructure of Dow Corning, silicones manufacturing facilities in Yamakita, Japan, and Greensboro, North Carolina, will be shut down. In addition, an idled facility was shut down in the second quarter of 2016. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of   $25 million  , reflected in Consumer Solutions (  $21 million  ) and Infrastructure Solutions (  $4 million  ). 

The closure and/or consolidation of certain corporate facilities and data centers. Write-downs of   $25 million   were charged against Corporate. These facilities will be shut down no later than the end of the second quarter of 2018. 

A decision was made to shut down a small manufacturing facility and to write-down other non-manufacturing assets, including a cost method investment and aircraft. Write-downs of   $33 million   were recorded, impacting Consumer Solutions (  $2 million  ), Performance Plastics (  $10 million  ) and Corporate (  $21 million  ). The manufacturing facility was shut down in the second quarter of 2016.

2015 Restructuring 
  On April 29, 2015, Dow's Board of Directors approved actions to further streamline the organization and optimize the Company s footprint as a result of the separation of a significant portion of Dow s chlorine value chain. These actions, which will further accelerate Dow s value growth and productivity targets, will result in a reduction of approximately   1,750   positions across a number of businesses and functions and adjustments to the Company's asset footprint to enhance competitiveness. These actions are expected to be completed primarily by March 31, 2017. 
    
  As a result of the 2015 restructuring activities, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of   $375 million   in the second quarter of 2015 consisting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities of   $10 million  , severance costs of   $196 million   and asset write-downs and write-offs of   $169 million  .

Dow expects to incur future costs related to its 2015 and 2016 restructuring activities, as the Company continually looks for ways to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of its operations, and to ensure competitiveness across its businesses and across geographic areas. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities and restructuring plan implementation costs; these will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and are not included in the restructuring activities tables. 

NOTE   4     ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
  Ownership Restructure of Dow Corning Corporation 
  On June 1, 2016, the Company announced the closing of the transaction with Corning Incorporated ("Corning"), Dow Corning and HS Upstate Inc., ( Splitco ), pursuant to which Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its   50 percent   equity interest in Dow Corning for   100 percent   of the stock of Splitco which held Corning's historical proportional interest in the Hemlock Semiconductor Group ("HSC Group") and approximately   $4.8 billion   in cash (the  DCC Transaction ). As a result of the DCC Transaction, Dow Corning, previously a 50:50 joint venture between Dow and Corning, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow. In connection with the DCC Transaction, on May 31, 2016, Dow Corning incurred   $4.5 billion   of indebtedness in order to fund the contribution of cash to Splitco. See Notes   6  ,   7  ,   13   and   14   for additional information.

At June 1, 2016, the Company's equity interest in Dow Corning, excluding the HSC Group, was   $1,968 million   and previously classified as "Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets. This equity interest was remeasured to fair value. As a result, the Company recognized a non-taxable gain of   $2,445 million   in the second quarter of 2016, net of closing costs and other comprehensive loss related to the Company's interest in Dow Corning. The gain was included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" and reflected in the Consumer Solutions (  $1,301 million  ) and Infrastructure Solutions (  $1,144 million  ) segments. The Company recognized a tax benefit of   $141 million   on the DCC Transaction in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to the reassessment of a previously recognized deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in the Company s investment in Dow Corning. 
    
  The Company utilized an income approach with a discounted cash flow model to determine the enterprise fair value of Dow Corning. The valuation process resulted in an enterprise fair value of   $9,636 million  . The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of Dow Corning's remaining assets and liabilities, excluding the HSC Group, on June 1, 2016, which are now fully consolidated by Dow. The valuation process is not complete at September 30, 2016. Final determination of the fair values may result in further adjustments to the values presented in the following table.

    Includes   $30 million   of trademarks,   $1,200 million   of licenses and intellectual property,   $2 million   of software and   $1,755 million   of customer-related intangibles. See Note   6   for additional information. 
              (2) 
    Includes pension and other postretirement benefits as well as long-term disability obligations. 
       
  The DCC Transaction resulted in the recognition of   $3,205 million   of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill largely consists of expected synergies resulting from the DCC Transaction. Cost synergies will be achieved through a combination of workforce consolidations and savings from actions such as harmonizing energy contracts at large sites, optimizing warehouse and logistics footprints, implementing materials and maintenance best practices, combining information technology service structures and leveraging existing research and development knowledge management systems. See Note   6   for additional information on goodwill, including the allocation by segment. 
    
  The fair value of "Accounts and notes receivables - Trade" acquired was   $647 million  , with gross contractual amounts receivable of   $654 million  . The fair value step-up in "Inventories" acquired was an increase of   $317 million  , which was expensed to "Cost of sales" over a three-month period beginning on June 1, 2016, and is reflected in the Consumer Solutions

See Note   11   for additional information on contingent liabilities. Gross operating loss carryforwards of   $568 million   were assumed from Dow Corning on June 1, 2016. The operating loss carryforwards expire either in years beyond   2020   or have an indefinite carryforward period. 
    
  The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities underlying the deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from DCC Transaction: 

The Company evaluated the disclosure requirements under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805 "Business Combinations" and determined the DCC Transaction was not a material business combination for purposes of disclosing the revenue and earnings of Dow Corning since the date of the ownership restructure as well as supplemental pro forma information.  
    
  Beginning in June 2016, the results of Dow Corning, excluding the HSC Group, are fully consolidated in the Company s consolidated statements of income. Prior to June 2016, the Company s   50 percent   share of Dow Corning s results of operations was reported in  Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates  in the consolidated statements of income. The results of the  HSC Group continue to be treated as an equity method investment and reported as  Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates  in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Acquisition of Cooperativa Central de Pesquisa Agr cola's Seed Business 
  On January 30, 2015, Dow AgroSciences LLC acquired Cooperativa Central de Pesquisa Agr cola's ("Coodetec") seed business for   $169 million  , of which   $121 million   was paid in 2015,   $24 million   was paid in the first quarter of 2016 and the remaining portion to be paid by the end of the first quarter of 2017. The acquisition of Coodetec's seed business is expected to advance the development of Dow AgroSciences' soybean program and strengthen the Company s position in the corn market segment. 
    
  Step Acquisition of Univation Technologies, LLC 
  On May 5, 2015, Univation Technologies, LLC ("Univation"), previously a 50:50 joint venture between Dow and ExxonMobil Chemical Company ("ExxonMobil"), became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow as a result of ExxonMobil redeeming its entire equity interest in Univation in exchange for certain assets and liabilities of Univation. The Company's equity interest in Univation of   $159 million  , previously classified as "Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets, was remeasured to fair value which resulted in a non-taxable gain of   $361 million   recognized in the second quarter of 2015, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" and reflected in the Performance Plastics segment.  
    
  Beginning in May 2015, Univation's results of operations were fully consolidated in the Company's consolidated statements of income. Prior to May 2015, the Company's   50 percent   share of Univation's results of operations was reported as "Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated statements of income.

  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a pretax gain of   $18 million   on the sale, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" and reflected in the Performance Materials   Chemicals segment. The Company recognized an after-tax loss of   $9 million   on the sale, primarily due to non-deductible goodwill included with this transaction. 
    
  Divestiture of ANGUS Chemical Company 
  On February 2, 2015, the Company sold ANGUS Chemical Company ( ANGUS ), part of the Performance Materials   Chemicals segment, to Golden Gate Capital.

The sale was completed for   $1.151 billion  , net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses, with proceeds subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The proceeds included a   $10 million   note receivable included in "Noncurrent receivables" in the consolidated balance sheets.   
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a pretax gain of   $670 million   on the sale, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" and reflected in the Performance Materials   Chemicals segment.  
    
  Divestiture of the AgroFresh Business 
  On July 31, 2015, the Company sold its AgroFresh business, part of the Agricultural Sciences segment, to Boulevard Acquisition Corp., which was subsequently renamed AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. ( AFSI ). The divestiture included trade receivables, inventory, property, customer lists, trademarks and certain intellectual property. The sale was completed for   $859 million  , net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses, with proceeds subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The proceeds included a   $635 million   cash payment;   17.5 million   common shares of AFSI, which represents a   35 percent   equity interest, valued at   $210 million   based on the closing stock price on July 31, 2015, and included in  Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates  in the consolidated balance sheets; and, a receivable for   six million   warrants to purchase common shares of AFSI, which was valued at   $14 million   at the time of close and classified as  Accounts and notes receivable - Other  in the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2016, the Company has yet to receive the warrants. The Company is also eligible to receive contingent consideration of   $50 million  , subject to certain performance conditions. In addition, the Company has an ongoing tax receivable agreement with AFSI, where AFSI is obligated to share with Dow tax savings associated with the purchase of the AgroFresh business. The Company did not recognize the contingent consideration or tax receivable agreement as proceeds. See Note   14   for further information on the Company s equity interest, receivable for the warrants and variable interests in AFSI.  
    
  In the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a pretax gain of   $624 million   on the sale, of which   $128 million   related to the Company's retained equity interest in AFSI.

  The Company evaluated the divestitures of SBH, ANGUS and AgroFresh and determined they did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and did not qualify as individually significant components of the Company. As a result, these divestitures were not reported as discontinued operations.

The Company has not reported the historical results of the chlorine value chain as discontinued operations in Dow's financial statements, as the divestiture of the chlorine value chain did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. However, the chlorine value chain was considered an individually significant component of the Company.

Investments 
  The Company s investments in marketable securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale. The following table provides the investing results from available-for-sale securities for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of the Company s investments in debt securities: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $850 million   (  $3,354 million   at   December 31, 2015  ) of held-to-maturity securities (primarily Treasury Bills) classified as cash equivalents, as these securities had maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company s investments in held-to-maturity securities are held at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had investments in money market funds of   $305 million   classified as cash equivalents (  $1,689 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). 
    
  The aggregate cost of the Company s cost method investments totaled   $110 million   at   September 30, 2016   (  $157 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). Due to the nature of these investments, either the cost basis approximates fair market value or fair value is not readily determinable. These investments are reviewed quarterly for impairment indicators. During the second quarter of 2016, a write-down of   $4 million   was recorded as part of the 2016 restructuring charge. The Company's impairment analysis resulted in   no   reduction in the cost basis of these investments, other than the restructuring charge, for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   (less than   $1 million   reduction in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015).

As part of the 2016 restructuring plan, the Company will shut down a number of manufacturing and corporate facilities. The manufacturing facilities and related assets, corporate facilities and data centers associated with this plan were written down to   zero   in the second quarter of 2016. The Company also rationalized its aircraft fleet in the second quarter of 2016. Certain of those aircraft, classified as a Level 3 measurement, were considered held for sale with a net carrying value of   $15 million   at September 30, 2016, using unobservable inputs, including assumptions a market participant would use to measure the fair value of the aircraft. The impairment charges related to the 2016 restructuring plan, totaling   $153 million  , were included in "Restructuring charges" in the consolidated statements of income. See Note   3   for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.   

NOTE   10     SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
  The Company uses "Sundry income (expense)   net" to record a variety of income and expense items such as foreign exchange gains and losses, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments and assets, and litigation. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , "Sundry income (expense) - net" was net expense of   $4 million   (net income of   $632 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  ). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , "Sundry income (expense) - net" was net income of   $1,305 million   (net income of   $1,680 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ).

NOTE   11     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
  Environmental Matters 
  Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on current law and existing technologies. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had accrued obligations of   $661 million   for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including   $72 million   for the remediation of Superfund sites. These obligations are included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" and "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets. This is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two and a half times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had accrued obligations of   $670 million   for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including   $74 million   for the remediation of Superfund sites. 
    
  Midland Off-Site Environmental Matters 
  A complete description of the Company s Midland Off-Site Environmental Matters can be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
    
  On July 21, 2016, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality approved a Corrective Action report, including a Remedial Action Plan ("RAP"), for the City of Midland. This is the final regulatory approval required for the City of Midland. Dow is implementing the monitoring and maintenance requirements of the RAP. At   September 30, 2016  , the accrual for these off-site matters was   $57 million   (included in the total accrued obligation of   $661 million   at   September 30, 2016  ). At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an accrual for these off-site matters of   $62 million   (included in the total accrued obligation of   $670 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). 
    
  Environmental Matters Summary 
  It is the opinion of the Company's management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those disclosed will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
    
  Litigation 
  Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation 
  Introduction 
  Union Carbide Corporation ( Union Carbide ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide s premises, and Union Carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. ( Amchem ). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide s products. 
    
  Union Carbide expects more asbestos-related suits to be filed against Union Carbide and Amchem in the future, and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve, as appropriate, both pending and future claims. 
    
  Based on a study completed in January 2003 by Analysis, Research   Planning Corporation (now known as Ankura Consulting Group, LLC ( Ankura ) as a result of the March 2016 merger of Analysis, Research   Planning Corporation and Ankura), Union Carbide increased its December 31, 2002 asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims for the 15-year period ending in 2017 to   $2.2 billion  , excluding future defense and processing costs. Since then, Union Carbide has compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate. In addition, Union Carbide has requested Ankura to review Union Carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity each year since 2004 to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent Ankura study. 

26 

     Table of Contents  

In October 2015, Union Carbide requested Ankura to review its historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its December 2014 study. In response to that request, Ankura reviewed and analyzed data through September 30, 2015. In December 2015, Ankura stated that an update of its study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in the December 2014 study and, therefore, the estimate in that study remained applicable. Based on Union Carbide's own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity and Ankura's response, Union Carbide determined that no change to the accrual would be required. At December 31, 2015, the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims was   $437 million  . At December 31, 2015, approximately   21 percent   of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately   79 percent   related to future claims.  
    
  Based on Union Carbide s review of   2016   activity, Union Carbide determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required at   September 30, 2016  . Union Carbide s asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims was   $398 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Approximately   22 percent   of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately   78 percent   related to future claims. 
    
  Union Carbide has receivables for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability as well as receivables for defense and resolution costs submitted to insurance carriers that have settlement agreements in place regarding their asbestos-related insurance coverage. Union Carbide continues to believe that its recorded receivable for insurance recoveries from all insurance carriers is probable of collection. At   September 30, 2016  , Union Carbide's receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability and defense and resolution costs was   $41 million   (  $61 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). 
    
  Union Carbide expenses defense costs as incurred. The pretax impact for defense and resolution costs, net of insurance, was   $20 million   in the third quarter of   2016   (  $20 million   in the third quarter of   2015  ) and   $55 million   in the first nine months of 2016 (  $65 million   in the first nine months of 2015) and was reflected in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Summary 
  The amounts recorded by Union Carbide for the asbestos-related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon current, known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed and/or received each year, the average cost of disposing of each such claim, coverage issues among insurers, and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the United States, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for Union Carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded. 
    
  Because of the uncertainties described above, Union Carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos-related claims facing Union Carbide and Amchem. Union Carbide s management believes that it is reasonably possible that the cost of disposing of Union Carbide s asbestos-related claims, including future defense costs, could have a material impact on Union Carbide s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of Union Carbide. 
    
  It is the opinion of Dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of Union Carbide disposing of its asbestos-related claims, including future defense costs, could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the Company. 
    
  Urethane Matters  
  Class Action Lawsuit 
  On February 16, 2006, the Company, among others, received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") as part of a previously announced antitrust investigation of manufacturers of polyurethane chemicals, including methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate, polyether polyols and system house products. The Company cooperated with the DOJ and, following an extensive investigation, on December 10, 2007, the Company received notice from the DOJ that it had closed its investigation of potential antitrust violations involving these products without indictments or pleas.  
    
  In 2005, the Company, among others, was named as a defendant in multiple civil class action lawsuits alleging a conspiracy to fix the price of various urethane chemical products, namely the products that were the subject of the above described DOJ antitrust investigation. These lawsuits were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (the "District Court") or have been tolled. On July 29, 2008, the District Court certified a class of purchasers of the products for the six-year period from 1999 through 2004 ("plaintiff class"). In January 2013, the class action lawsuit went to trial in the District Court with the Company as the sole remaining defendant, the other defendants having previously settled. On February 20, 2013, the jury returned a damages verdict of approximately   $400 million   against the Company, which ultimately was trebled by the District Court under applicable antitrust laws, less offsets from other settling defendants, resulting in a judgment entered in July 2013 in the amount of   $1.06 billion  . The Company appealed this judgment to the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals  
  
    27 

     Table of Contents  

("Tenth Circuit" or "Court of Appeals"), and on September 29, 2014, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the District Court judgment. On October 14, 2014, the Company filed a petition for Rehearing or Rehearing   En Banc   (collectively the "Rehearing Petition") with the Court of Appeals, which was denied on November 7, 2014. 
    
  On March 9, 2015, the Company filed a petition for   writ of certiorari   ("Writ Petition") with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking judicial review by the Supreme Court and requesting that it correct fundamental errors in the Circuit Court opinion. In April 2015, six amici filed amicus briefs in support of the Company's Writ Petition. On June 8, 2015, the Supreme Court granted a petition for a   writ of certiorari   in another case,   Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, PEG, et al., ("Tyson Foods")   (Supreme Court No. 14-1146), which presented an issue core to the questions presented in the Company's Writ Petition: whether class-wide damages can be determined by simply applying the average injury observed in a sample. The Company's case was considered by the Supreme Court in conference on June 11, 2015. On June 15, 2015, the Supreme Court issued its decisions from its conference and did not rule on the Company's Writ Petition. Subsequently, the Writ Petition was not listed for further consideration by the Supreme Court at its weekly conferences. The Company was advised that this meant that the Supreme Court was withholding further consideration of the Company's Writ Petition while it considered the   Tyson Foods   case on the merits.  
    
  On February 26, 2016, the Company announced a proposed settlement under which Dow would pay the plaintiff class   $835 million  , which includes damages, class attorney fees and post-judgment interest. The agreement was conditioned upon the Supreme Court holding Dow's Writ Petition in abeyance and subsequent approval of the class settlement by the District Court. The proposed settlement resolves the   $1.06 billion   judgment and any subsequent claim for attorneys' fees, costs and post-judgment interest against Dow. As a result, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a loss of   $835 million  , included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and reflected in the Performance Materials   Chemicals segment. On March 7, 2016, the Supreme Court approved the joint motion to hold Dow s Writ Petition in abeyance and on April 27, 2016, the District Court provided preliminary approval of the settlement. On May 11, 2016, the Company moved the   $835 million   settlement amount into an escrow account (per the terms of the Settlement Agreement). The District Court granted final approval of the settlement on July 29, 2016, and the settlement amount was released from escrow on August 30, 2016.  
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, Dow changed its risk assessment on this matter as a result of new growing political uncertainties due to events within the Supreme Court, including Justice Scalia's death, and the increased likelihood for unfavorable outcomes for businesses involved in class action lawsuits. Of particular importance was the fact that Justice Scalia had written the majority opinions in both the   Wal-Mart   and   Comcast   cases. The Company continues to believe that it was not part of any conspiracy and the judgment was fundamentally flawed as a matter of class action law.     Regardless, the case is now concluded. 
    
  Opt-Out Cases 
  Shortly after the July 2008 class certification ruling, a series of "opt-out" cases were filed by a number of large volume purchasers who elected not to be class members. These opt-out cases are substantively identical to the class action lawsuit, but expanded the period of time to include 1994 through 1998. On September 30, 2014, the opt-out cases, which had been consolidated with the class action lawsuit for purposes of pre-trial proceedings were remanded from the District Court to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. A consolidated jury trial of the opt-out cases began on March 8, 2016. On April 5, 2016, the Company entered into a binding settlement for the opt-out cases under which Dow would pay the plaintiffs   $400 million  , inclusive of damages and attorney fees. Payment of this settlement occurred on May 4, 2016. The Company changed its risk assessment on this matter as a result of the uncertainty of a jury trial outcome along with the automatic trebling of an adverse verdict. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of   $400 million   in the first quarter of 2016, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and reflected in the Performance Materials   Chemicals segment. The Company continues to deny allegations of price fixing and maintains that it was not part of any conspiracy. 
    
  Canadian Matters 
  In addition to the matters described above, there are two separate but inter-related matters in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. In March 2014, the Superior Court of Justice in London, Ontario, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs  motion for class certification.  The Company filed its Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal in March 2014, which was subsequently denied. This matter is currently in the preliminary pre-trial stage, but no trial date has been set. With a certified class in the Ontario case, the Quebec case is effectively rendered moot and, therefore, the parties have agreed that it will not be prosecuted independently of any future outcome in the Ontario case. The Company has concluded it is not probable a loss has been incurred and, therefore, a liability is not recorded with respect to these matters. The Company has determined that any possible loss on these matters is not material to the Company s results of operations and cash flows as the Company's exposure is significantly less than the Class Action Lawsuit and Opt-Out Cases due to: (i) the limited exposure period based upon other known settlements relating to  
  
    28 

     Table of Contents  

the Canadian Matters, (ii) antitrust verdicts in Canada are not trebled, and (iii) the Canadian cases are based on different legal theories and different applicable law. 
    
  Bayer CropScience v. Dow AgroSciences ICC Arbitration 
  On August 13, 2012, Bayer CropScience AG and Bayer CropScience NV (together,  Bayer ) filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") International Court of Arbitration against Dow AgroSciences LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and other subsidiaries of the Company (collectively,  DAS ) under a 1992 license agreement executed by predecessors of the parties (the  License Agreement ). In its request for arbitration, Bayer alleged that (i) DAS breached the License Agreement, (ii) the License Agreement was properly terminated with no ongoing rights to DAS, (iii) DAS has infringed and continues to infringe its patent rights related to the use of the pat gene in certain soybean and cotton seed products, and (iv) Bayer is entitled to monetary damages and injunctive relief. DAS denied that it breached the License Agreement and asserted that the License Agreement remained in effect because it was not properly terminated. DAS also asserted that all of Bayer s patents at issue are invalid and/or not infringed, and, therefore, for these reasons (and others), a license was not required. During the pendency of the arbitration proceeding, DAS filed six re-examination petitions with the United States Patent   Trademark Office ( USPTO ) against the Bayer patents, asserting that each patent is invalid based on the doctrine against double-patenting and/or prior art. The USPTO granted all six petitions, and, on February 26, 2015, the USPTO issued an office action rejecting the patentability of the sole Bayer patent claim in the only asserted Bayer patent that has not expired and that forms the basis for the vast majority of the damages in the arbitral award discussed below. 
    
  A three-member arbitration tribunal presided over the arbitration proceeding (the  tribunal ). In a decision dated October 9, 2015, the tribunal determined that (i) DAS breached the License Agreement, (ii) Bayer properly terminated the License Agreement, (iii) all of the patents remaining in the proceeding are valid and infringed, and (iv) that Bayer is entitled to monetary damages in the amount of   $455 million   inclusive of pre-judgment interest and costs (the  arbitral award ). One of the arbitrators, however, issued a partial dissent finding that all of the patents are invalid based on the double-patenting doctrine. The tribunal also denied Bayer s request for injunctive relief. The arbitration award is not self-executing, and must be confirmed by a court for it to be enforceable and to have the legal effect of a judgment. On October 16, 2015, Bayer filed a motion in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ("federal district court") seeking to confirm the arbitral award. DAS opposed the motion and filed separate motions to vacate the award, or in the alternative, to stay enforcement of the award until the USPTO issues final office actions with respect to the re-examination proceedings. On January 15, 2016, the federal district court denied DAS's motions and confirmed the award. The USPTO has now issued office actions rejecting the patentability of all four patents that Bayer asserted in the case. The USPTO re-examination proceedings remain ongoing. DAS has appealed the federal district court's decision, and DAS has posted a bond to stay enforcement of the award during the appeal. 
    
  The Company believes the arbitral award is fundamentally flawed in numerous respects and is confident that it will be vacated on appeal because it (i) violates U.S. public policy prohibiting enforcement of invalid patents, (ii) manifestly disregards applicable law, and (iii) disregards unambiguous contract provisions and ignores the essence of the applicable contracts. The Company continues to believe that Bayer s patents are invalid for multiple reasons and that the damages awarded cannot be supported under prevailing patent law, including U.S. Supreme Court precedent. In addition, the Company anticipates that the USPTO will conclude with final office actions declaring each of the patents invalid in the pending re-examination proceedings which will provide a strong basis to vacate the arbitral award. If the federal appellate court denies the Company's appeal, the Company can seek judicial review by the U.S. Supreme Court.  
    
  As part of the Company s review of the arbitral award, the Company assessed the legal and factual circumstances of the case, the record of the arbitration and USPTO re-examination status, and the applicable law to vacate the arbitral award. Based on this review and the reasons stated above, the Company has concluded it is not probable that a loss has been incurred and, therefore, a liability has not been recorded with respect to this matter. While the Company believes it is not probable that a loss has been incurred, the existence of the arbitral award and the federal district court confirmation of the award indicates that it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur. The estimate of the possible range of loss to the Company is   zero   to the   $455 million   amount set forth in the arbitral award (excluding post-judgment interest). 
    
  The arbitral award will not impact DAS s commercialization of its soybean and cotton seed products, including those containing the ENLIST  technologies.

Rocky Flats Matter 
  The Company and Rockwell International Corporation ("Rockwell") (collectively, the "defendants") were defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in 1990 on behalf of property owners ("plaintiffs") in Rocky Flats, Colorado, who asserted claims for nuisance and trespass based on alleged property damage caused by plutonium releases from a nuclear weapons facility owned by the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") (the "facility"). Dow and Rockwell were both DOE contractors that operated the facility - Dow from 1952 to 1975 and Rockwell from 1975 to 1989. The facility was permanently shut down in 1989.  
    
  In 1993, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado ("District Court") certified the class of property owners. The plaintiffs tried their case as a public liability action under the Price Anderson Act ("PAA"). In 2005, the jury returned a damages verdict of   $926 million  . Dow and Rockwell appealed the jury award to the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ("Court of Appeals") which concluded the PAA had its own injury requirements, on which the jury had not been instructed, and also vacated the District Court's class certification ruling, reversed and remanded the case, and vacated the District Court's judgment (  Cook v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 618 F.3d 1127, 1133 (10th Cir. 2010  )). The plaintiffs argued on remand to the District Court that they were entitled to reinstate the judgment as a state law nuisance claim, independent of the PAA. The District Court rejected that argument and entered judgment in favor of the defendants (  Cook v. Rockwell Int'l Corp, 13 F. Supp. 3d 1153 (D. Colo. 2014  )). The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the District Court's ruling, holding that the PAA did not preempt the plaintiffs' nuisance claim under Colorado law and that the plaintiffs could seek reinstatement of the prior nuisance verdict under Colorado law, and remanded for additional proceedings, including consideration of whether the District Court could recertify the class (  Cook v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 790 F.3d 1088 (10th Cir. 2015  )).  
    
  Dow and Rockwell continued to litigate this matter in the District Court and in the United States Supreme Court. On May 18, 2016, Dow, Rockwell and the plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement for   $375 million  , of which   $131 million   will be paid by Dow and   $244 million   will be paid by Rockwell. The DOE authorized the settlement pursuant to the PAA and the nuclear hazards indemnity provisions contained in Dow and Rockwell's contracts. As a result, the Company expects to be fully indemnified by the DOE for the settlement amount. The District Court granted preliminary approval to the class settlement on August 5, 2016, and set a fairness hearing on the settlement for April 28, 2017. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a liability of   $130 million   related to this matter (having already paid $1 million towards class notice costs), included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets and expects to make the settlement payment to the plaintiffs no later than July 28, 2017. The Company also recorded a receivable of   $131 million   related to this matter, included in "Noncurrent receivables" in the consolidated balance sheets, and expects to receive its indemnification payment in 2017. 
    
  Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters    
  Introduction 
  In 1995, Dow Corning, then a 50:50 joint venture between Dow and Corning Incorporated, voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to resolve Dow Corning s breast implant liabilities and related matters (the  Chapter 11 Proceeding ). Dow Corning emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on June 1, 2004 (the  Effective Date ) and is implementing the Joint Plan of Reorganization (the  Plan ). The Plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding and provides a process for the satisfaction of commercial creditor claims in the Chapter 11 Proceeding. As of June 1, 2016, Dow Corning is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow. 
    
  Breast Implant and Other Product Liability Claims 
  The centerpiece of the Plan is a product liability settlement program administered by an independent claims office (the  Settlement Facility ). Product liability claimants rejecting the settlement program in favor of pursuing litigation must bring suit against a litigation facility (the  Litigation Facility ). Under the Plan, total payments committed by Dow Corning to resolving product liability claims are capped at a maximum   $2,350 million   net present value ( NPV ) determined as of the Effective Date using a discount rate of   seven percent   (approximately   $3,600 million   undiscounted at   September 30, 2016  ). Of this amount, no more than   $400 million   NPV determined as of the Effective Date can be used to fund the Litigation Facility.   
    
  Dow Corning has an obligation to fund the Settlement Facility and the Litigation Facility over a 16-year period, commencing at the Effective Date. Under the Plan, Dow Corning is not required to remit additional funds to the Settlement Facility unless and until necessary to preserve liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , Dow Corning and its insurers have made life-to-date payments of   $1,762 million   to the Settlement Facility and the Settlement Facility reported an unexpended balance of   $152 million  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a liability recorded for breast implant and other product liability claims ( Implant Liability ) of   $290 million  , included in  Other noncurrent obligations  in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded the Implant Liability as part of the ownership restructure of Dow Corning on June 1, 2016, and, in accordance with ASC 450  Accounting for Contingencies,  recognized the estimated impact of the settlement of future claims primarily based on reported claim filing levels in the Revised Settlement Program (the  RSP ). The RSP was a program sponsored by certain  
  
    30 

     Table of Contents  

other breast implant manufacturers in the context of multi-district, coordinated federal breast implant cases and was open from 1995 through 2010. The RSP was also a revised successor to an earlier settlement plan involving Dow Corning (prior to its bankruptcy filing). While Dow Corning withdrew from the RSP, many of the benefit categories and payment levels in Dow Corning s settlement program were drawn from the RSP. Based on the comparability in design and actual claim experience of both plans, management concluded that claim information from the RSP provides a reasonable basis to estimate future claim filing levels for the Settlement Facility. With the assistance of a third-party advisor, Dow Corning developed an estimate of the future Settlement Facility liability, primarily based on the assumption that future claim filings in the remaining periods of the Settlement Facility will be similar to claim filing trends observed in the RSP. 
    
  Dow Corning is not aware of circumstances that would change the factors used in estimating the liability and believes the recorded liability reflects the best estimate of the remaining funding obligations under the Plan; however, the estimate relies upon a number of significant assumptions, including: 

Future claim filing levels in the Settlement Facility will be similar to the RSP; 
                
    Future acceptance rates, disease mix, and payment values will be materially consistent with historical experience; 
                
    No material negative outcomes in future controversies or disputes over Plan interpretation will occur; and 
                
    The Plan will not be modified. 
       
  If actual outcomes related to any of these assumptions prove to be materially different, the future liability to fund the Plan may be materially different than the amount estimated. If Dow Corning was ultimately required to fund the full liability up to the maximum capped value, the liability would be   $1,839 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Commercial Creditor Issues 
  The Plan provides that each of Dow Corning s commercial creditors (the  Commercial Creditors ) would receive in cash the sum of (a) an amount equal to the principal amount of their claims and (b) interest on such claims.     The actual amount of interest that will ultimately be paid to these Commercial Creditors is uncertain due to pending litigation between Dow Corning and the Commercial Creditors regarding the appropriate interest rates to be applied to outstanding obligations from the 1995 bankruptcy filing date through the Effective Date, as well as the presence of any recoverable fees, costs, and expenses.   
    
  In 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that there is a general presumption that contractually specified default interest should be paid by a solvent debtor to unsecured creditors (the  Interest Rate Presumption ) and permitting Dow Corning s Commercial Creditors to recover fees, costs, and expenses where allowed by relevant loan agreements and state law. The matter was remanded to the U.S.     District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan ("District Court") for further proceedings, including rulings on the facts surrounding specific claims and consideration of any equitable factors that would preclude the application of the Interest Rate Presumption.  
    
  Upon the Plan becoming effective, Dow Corning paid approximately   $1,500 million   to the Commercial Creditors, representing principal and an amount of interest that Dow Corning considers undisputed. At   September 30, 2016  , Dow Corning has estimated its remaining liability to the Commercial Creditors to be within a range of   $106 million   to   $352 million  . However, no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Therefore, Dow Corning recorded the minimum liability within the range. At   September 30, 2016  , the liability related to Dow Corning s potential obligation to pay additional interest to its Commercial Creditors in the Chapter 11 Proceeding was   $106 million   and included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. The actual amount of interest that will be paid to these creditors is uncertain and will ultimately be resolved through continued proceedings in the District Court. 
    
  Indemnifications 
  In connection with the DCC Transaction discussed in Note   4  , the Company is indemnified for   50 percent   of future losses associated with certain pre-closing liabilities, including the Implant Liability and Commercial Creditors matters described above, subject to certain conditions and limits. The maximum amount of indemnified losses which may be recovered are subject to a cap that declines over time. Indemnified losses are capped at (1)   $1.5 billion   until May 31, 2018, (2)   $1 billion   between May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2023, and (3) no recoveries are permitted after May 31, 2023. No indemnification assets were recorded at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Summary 
  The actual amount of Dow Corning s future liabilities to resolve Chapter 11 related matters and future recoveries under related indemnification provisions are uncertain. As additional facts and circumstances develop related to Chapter 11 matters, it is at least reasonably possible that estimates recorded by Dow Corning may be revised. Future revisions, if required, could have a material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations in the period or periods in which such revisions are recorded. Since any specific future developments, and the impact such developments might have on amounts recorded in  
  
    31 

     Table of Contents  

the Company s consolidated financial statements, are unknown at this time, an estimate of possible future adjustments cannot be made. 
    
  It is the opinion of Dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of Dow Corning disposing of its Chapter 11 liabilities could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the Company. 
    
  Other Litigation Matters 
  In addition to the specific matters described above, the Company is party to a number of other claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability, patent infringement, governmental regulation, contract and commercial litigation, and other actions. Certain of these actions purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts. All such claims are being contested. Dow has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers at various times. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies described above. It is the opinion of the Company s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such other claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company. 
    
  Purchase Commitments 
  A summary of the Company's purchase commitments can be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to the purchase commitments since   December 31, 2015  . 

Guarantees 
  The following tables provide a summary of the final expiration, maximum future payments and recorded liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for each type of guarantee: 

Guarantees 
  Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if specified triggering events occur. With guarantees, such as commercial or financial contracts, non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. The majority of the Company s guarantees relate to debt of nonconsolidated affiliates, which have expiration dates ranging from less than one year to five years, and trade financing transactions in Latin America, which typically expire within one year of inception. The Company s current expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered unlikely. 
    
  The Company has entered into guarantee agreements ( Guarantees ) related to project financing for Sadara, a nonconsolidated affiliate. The total of an Islamic bond and additional project financing (collectively  Total Project Financing ) obtained by Sadara is approximately   $12.5 billion  . Sadara had   $12.2 billion   of Total Project Financing outstanding at   September 30, 2016   (  $11.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  ). The Company's guarantee of the Total Project Financing is in proportion to the Company's   35 percent   ownership interest in Sadara, or up to approximately   $4.4 billion   when the project financing is fully drawn. The Guarantees will be released upon completion of construction of the Sadara complex and satisfactory fulfillment of certain other conditions, including passage of an extensive operational testing program, which is currently anticipated by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and must occur no later than December 2020.

Residual Value Guarantees 
  The Company provides guarantees related to leased assets specifying the residual value that will be available to the lessor at lease termination through sale of the assets to the lessee or third parties. 
    
  Warranties 
  The Company provides warranty policies on certain products and accrues liabilities under warranty policies using historical warranty claim experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change. The following table summarizes changes in the Company's warranty liability: 

(1) 
    In the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a pretax charge of   $10 million   as part of the 2016 restructuring charge. The charge was included in "Restructuring charges" in the consolidated statements of income and reflected in Infrastructure Solutions. See Note   3   for additional information. 
       
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  The Company has recognized asset retirement obligations for the following activities: demolition and remediation activities at manufacturing and administrative sites primarily in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Europe; and capping activities at landfill sites in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Italy. The Company has also recognized conditional asset retirement obligations related to asbestos encapsulation as a result of planned demolition and remediation activities at manufacturing and administrative sites primarily in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Europe. 
    
  The aggregate carrying amount of asset retirement obligations recognized by the Company was   $113 million   at   September 30, 2016   (  $96 million   at   December 31, 2015  ), which included   $14 million   of asset retirement obligations assumed in the DCC Transaction. These obligations are included in the consolidated balance sheets as "Accrued and other current liabilities" and "Other noncurrent obligations." 
    
  The Company has not recognized conditional asset retirement obligations for which a fair value cannot be reasonably estimated in its consolidated financial statements. It is the opinion of the Company s management that the possibility is remote that such conditional asset retirement obligations, when estimable, will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on current costs.

NOTE   12     TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 
  The Company sells trade accounts receivable of select North American entities and qualifying trade accounts receivable of select European entities on a revolving basis to certain multi-seller commercial paper conduit entities ("conduits"). The proceeds received are comprised of cash and interests in specified assets of the conduits (the receivables sold by the Company) that entitle the Company to the residual cash flows of such specified assets in the conduits after the commercial paper has been repaid. Neither the conduits nor the investors in those entities have recourse to other assets of the Company in the event of nonpayment by the debtors. 
    
  The following table summarizes the carrying value of interests held, which represents the Company's maximum exposure to loss related to the receivables sold, and the percentage of anticipated credit losses related to the trade accounts receivable sold. Also provided is the sensitivity of the fair value of the interests held to hypothetical adverse changes in the anticipated credit losses; amounts shown below are the corresponding hypothetical decreases in the carrying value of interests.  

Credit losses, net of any recoveries, on receivables sold were   insignificant   during the   three  - and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Following is an analysis of certain cash flows between the Company and the conduits:

Available Credit Facilities 
  The following table summarizes the Company's credit facilities: 

In connection with the DCC Transaction, on May 31, 2016, Dow Corning incurred   $4.5 billion   of indebtedness under a certain third party credit agreement ("DCC Term Loan Facility") in order to fund the contribution of cash to Splitco. Subsequent to the DCC Transaction, the Company guaranteed the obligations of Dow Corning under the DCC Term Loan Facility and, as a result, the covenants and events of default applicable to the DCC Term Loan Facility are substantially similar to the covenants and events of default set forth in the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the DCC Term Loan Facility are repayable on May 30, 2017, subject to a 364-day extension option, at Dow Corning's election, upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent. Dow Corning intends to exercise the 364-day extension option on the DCC Term Loan Facility. See Note   4   for additional information on the DCC Transaction. 
    
  Debt Covenants and Default Provisions 
  There were no material changes to the debt covenants and default provisions related to the Company's outstanding long-term debt and primary, private credit agreements in the first   nine   months of 2016.

NOTE   14     VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
  A complete description of the Company's variable interest entities ("VIEs") can be found in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Consolidated VIEs 
  The Company was a partner in a joint venture located in Brazil that produces ethanol from sugarcane. The Company's variable interests in this joint venture related to an equity option between the partners, a parental loan and guarantee related to debt financing, and contractual arrangements limiting the partner's initial participation in the economics of certain assets and liabilities. Since formation of the joint venture, the partners amended the governing documents, including terms of the equity option. Terms of the equity option required the Company to purchase the partner's equity investment at a price based on a specified formula if the partner elected to exit the joint venture. In August 2015, the partner exercised its equity option which resulted in the Company reclassifying the partner's equity investment from "Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest" to "Accrued and other current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. On March 31, 2016, the partner's equity investment transferred to the Company. On July 11, 2016, the Company paid   $202 million   to the former partner, which is classified as "Purchases of noncontrolling interests" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. This former joint venture is now   100 percent   owned by the Company, therefore its asset and liability balances are not included in the September 30, 2016, balances in the "Assets and Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs" table below. The Company continues to hold variable interests in a related entity that owns a cogeneration facility. The Company's variable interests are the result of a tolling arrangement where it provides fuel to the entity and purchases a majority of the cogeneration facility s output on terms that ensure a return to the entity s equity holders. The assets and liabilities of the cogeneration facility continue to be included in the table below.  
    
  The Company was a   49 percent   owner of a joint venture that managed the growth, harvest and conditioning of soybean seed and grain, corn and wheat in the United States. The Company's variable interest in this joint venture related to an equity option between the partners. Terms of the equity option required the Company to purchase the partner's equity investment at a price based on a specified formula, after a specified period of time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, if the partner elected to sell its equity investment. On August 10, 2015, the equity option was determined to be exercisable and the partner provided notice to the Company of its intent to exercise the equity option, which resulted in a   $22 million   after-tax loss, included in "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests" in the consolidated statements of income. The Company purchased the partner's equity investment on September 18, 2015, which resulted in the joint venture becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow. Subsequent to the purchase of the partner's equity investment, the Company sold its entire ownership interest in the subsidiary to a third party and recognized a pretax gain of   $44 million   on the sale in the third quarter of 2015, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and reflected in the Agricultural Sciences segment. 
    
  The Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of VIEs, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The other equity holders  interests are reflected in  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  in the consolidated statements of income and "Non-redeemable noncontrolling interests" and "Accrued and other current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. The table that follows summarizes the carrying amounts of the VIEs  assets and liabilities included in the Company s consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1)    All assets were restricted at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In addition, the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in the Company s consolidated balance sheets pertaining to an entity created to monetize accounts receivable of select European entities were current assets of   $497 million   (  zero   restricted) at   September 30, 2016   (  $103 million  ,   zero   restricted, at   December 31, 2015  ) and current liabilities of   $8 million   (  zero   nonrecourse) at   September 30, 2016   (  less than $1 million  ,   zero   nonrecourse, at   December 31, 2015  ).

Amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets and the preceding table as restricted assets or nonrecourse obligations relating to consolidated VIEs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are adjusted for intercompany eliminations and parental guarantees. 
    
  Nonconsolidated VIEs 
  As a result of the DCC Transaction, the Company holds variable interests in a joint venture that sells polysilicon. The variable interests relate to an equity interest held by the Company and arrangements between the Company and the joint venture to provide services. The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as it does not direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this entity; therefore, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a negative investment basis of   $934 million   in this joint venture, which is classified as "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss was   zero   at   September 30, 2016  . See Note   7   for additional information on this variable interest entity. 
    
  Also as a result of the DCC Transaction, the Company holds minority voting interests in certain joint ventures that produce silicon inputs for the Company. These joint ventures operate under supply agreements that sell inventory to the equity owners using pricing mechanisms that guarantee a return, therefore shielding the joint ventures from the obligation to absorb expected losses. As a result of the pricing mechanisms of these agreements, these entities are determined to be variable interest entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as it does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities; therefore, the entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these variable interest entities is determined to be the carrying value of the investment in these entities. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's investment in these joint ventures was   $95 million   and is classified as "Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets, representing the Company's maximum exposure to loss. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s investment in its crude acrylic acid joint venture was   $163 million   (  $160 million   at   December 31, 2015  ) and is classified as  Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates  in the consolidated balance sheets, representing the Company s maximum exposure to loss. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's investment in AFSI was   $190 million   (  $191 million   at   December 31, 2015  ), and is classified as "Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has a receivable with AFSI for   six million   warrants, which was valued at   $5 million   at   September 30, 2016   (  $6 million   at   December 31, 2015  ) and classified as "Accounts and notes receivable - Other" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss was   $195 million   at   September 30, 2016   (  $197 million   at   December 31, 2015  ).

See Note   4    for additional information on the DCC Transaction. 
    
  The net periodic benefit cost for all significant plans of the Company are as follows: 

(1) 
    Includes net periodic benefit cost for plans assumed from Dow Corning for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of   $9 million   for defined benefit pension plans (  $12 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016) and   $3 million   for other postretirement benefits (  $4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016).

NOTE   16     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
  A complete description of the Company's stock-based compensation plans can be found in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  The Company grants stock-based compensation to employees under The Dow Chemical Company 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2012 ESPP"). Under the 2016 annual offering of the 2012 ESPP, most employees were eligible to purchase shares of common stock of the Company valued at up to   10 percent   of their annual base salary. The value is determined using the plan price multiplied by the number of shares subscribed to by the employee. The plan price of the stock is set at an amount equal to at least   85 percent   of the fair market value (closing price) of the common stock on a date during the fourth quarter of the year prior to the offering, or the average fair market value (closing price) of the common stock over a period during the fourth quarter of the year prior to the offering, in each case, specified by the Vice President of Human Resources.  
    
  During the first quarter of   2016  , employees subscribed to the right to purchase   2.1 million   shares of the Company's common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of   $40.44   per share and a weighted-average fair value of   $3.40   per share under the 2012 ESPP. 
    
  Stock Incentive Plan 
  The Company also grants stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors under The Dow Chemical Company Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"). Most of the Company's stock-based compensation awards are granted in the first quarter of each year. There was minimal employee grant activity in the second and third quarters of 2016.

NOTE   17     EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS 
  The following tables provide the earnings per share calculations for the three- and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Deferred stock awards are considered participating securities due to Dow's practice of paying dividend equivalents on unvested shares.  
              (2) 
    Preferred stock dividends were not added back in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , because the effect of adding them back would have been antidilutive. 
              (3) 
    Conversion of the Company's Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A into shares of the Company's common stock was excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , because the effect of including them would have been antidilutive. 
              (4) 
    These outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock and deferred stock awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of including them would have been antidilutive.

NOTE   18     INCOME TAXES 
  In the second quarter of 2016, an adjustment was made to a reserve for a tax matter regarding a historical change in the legal ownership structure of a nonconsolidated affiliate. The adjustment arose due to recent proceedings and the Company s ongoing assessment of the unrecognized tax benefits. The adjustment impacted multiple jurisdictions and resulted in an increase of   $396 million   to  Other noncurrent obligations  and an increase of   $339 million   to  Deferred income tax assets  in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016, resulting in an unfavorable impact of   $57 million   to  Provision for income taxes  in the consolidated statements of income in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Includes   $126 million   related to the DCC Transaction. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was   $226 million   (  $206 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). A portion of the increase in the unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016, is related to the matter discussed above, and, if paid, is creditable in the United States. 
    
  Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of  Provision for income taxes,  in the consolidated statements of income and totaled a benefit of   $17 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (a benefit of   $1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  ). During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a charge of   $73 million   for interest and penalties (a charge of   $14 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  ). The Company s accrual for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions was   $246 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $159 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

NOTE   21     OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 
  As of June 1, 2016, Dow Corning, previously a 50:50 joint venture with Corning, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow as a result of the DCC Transaction. Dow and Corning continue to maintain their historical proportional equity interest in the HSC Group. Beginning in June 2016, the results of Dow Corning are fully consolidated into the Company's consolidated statements of income and will continue to be aligned with the Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions operating segments. The results of the HSC Group will continue to be reported as "Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates" in the Company's consolidated statements of income and aligned with the Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions operating segments. See Note   4   for additional information on this transaction. 

(1) 
    The Company uses EBITDA (which Dow defines as earnings (i.e., "Net Income") before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as its measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes. EBITDA by operating segment includes all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to the Company as a whole are assigned to Corporate. A reconciliation of EBITDA to "Income Before Income Taxes" is provided below:     

Transfers of products between operating segments are generally valued at cost. However, transfers of products to Agricultural Sciences from other segments are generally valued at market-based prices; the revenues generated by these transfers in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   were immaterial and eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE   22     PLANNED MERGER WITH DUPONT  
  On December 11, 2015, Dow and E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") to effect an all-stock, merger of equals strategic combination resulting in a newly formed corporation named DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Dow and DuPont will each merge with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the "Mergers") and, as a result of the Mergers, will become subsidiaries of DowDuPont. Following the consummation of the Mergers, Dow and DuPont intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company s agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through one or more tax-efficient transactions. Additional information about the Merger Agreement is included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on December 11, 2015, as well as in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  On June 9, 2016, DowDuPont's registration statement filed with the SEC on Form S-4 (File No. 333-209869), as amended, was declared effective. The registration statement was filed in connection with the proposed Mergers and includes a joint proxy statement of Dow and DuPont and a prospectus of DowDuPont. The companies also scheduled special meetings of their respective stockholders to seek adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of related matters from such stockholders. Each company's common stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 2, 2016, were entitled to vote at the respective meeting. Dow's special meeting of stockholders was held on July 20, 2016, which resulted in a vote for adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of related matters.  
    
  Dow and DuPont remain focused on closing the transaction and continue to work constructively with regulatory agencies in all relevant jurisdictions. Given current regulatory agency status, closing would be expected to occur in the first quarter of 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of all regulatory approvals.

    The Dow Chemical Company and Subsidiaries 
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION, Item 2. Management s Discussion and 
  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

OVERVIEW 
             
    The Company reported sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   of   $12.5 billion  , up 4 percent from   $12.0 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , with increases across all operating segments, except Performance Materials   Chemicals. Sales increased in Asia Pacific and North America and declined in Europe, Middle East, Africa and India ("EMEAI") and Latin America.  

Volume increased 10 percent compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , as increases in Consumer Solutions (up 45 percent), Infrastructure Solutions (up 38 percent), Performance Plastics (up 10 percent) and Agricultural Sciences (up 3 percent) more than offset a decrease in Performance Materials   Chemicals (down 16 percent). Volume increased in all geographic areas, including double-digit increases in Asia Pacific (up 22 percent) and North America (up 10 percent). Excluding recent acquisitions and divestitures   (1)   , volume was up 6 percent. On the same basis, volume increased in Performance Plastics (up 11 percent), Performance Materials   Chemicals (up 4 percent), and Agricultural Sciences and Consumer Solutions (both up 3 percent) and declined in Infrastructure Solutions (down 3 percent). Volume increased in EMEAI (up 9 percent), North America (up 6 percent), Asia Pacific (up 4 percent) and Latin America (up 1 percent). 

Price was down 6 percent compared with the same period last year, driven primarily by lower feedstock and raw material prices and competitive pricing pressures. Price declined in all operating segments, except Agricultural Sciences (up 3 percent), and all geographic areas, including a double-digit decline in EMEAI (down 11 percent).  

Purchased feedstock and energy costs, which account for approximately one-third of Dow s total costs, decreased approximately $240 million (8 percent) compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily due to lower naphtha, condensate, natural gas and monomer costs.  

Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses were   $864 million   in the third quarter of 2016, up   $175 million   from   $689 million   in the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased costs associated with transactions and productivity actions which includes financial, legal and professional advisory fees associated with the planned all-stock merger of equals transaction with E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont"), costs associated with the ownership restructure of Dow Corning Corporation ("Dow Corning" and "DCC Transaction"), implementation costs related to the Company's restructuring programs and other productivity actions, and increased spending due to the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business which more than offset lower expenses as a result of recent divestitures. 

Equity earnings were   $70 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down   $65 million   from   $135 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher equity losses at Sadara Chemical Company ("Sadara") related to start-up expenses and lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures resulting from lower monoethylene glycol prices and a reduction in the ownership of MEGlobal (now part of EQUATE Petrochemicals Company K.S.C. ("EQUATE")). Equity earnings also declined as a result of the DCC Transaction. 

The Company resumed its share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2016, purchasing 7.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $416 million. 
       
  In addition to the financial highlights, the following events occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016  : 

In connection with the planned merger of equals transaction with DuPont, Dow held a special meeting of stockholders on July 20, 2016. Stockholders of the Company voted to approve all stockholder proposals necessary to complete the merger of equals transaction. 

On August 29, 2016, the Company announced that its joint venture in the Middle East - Sadara - achieved a significant milestone with the successful start-up of its mixed feed cracker and a third polyethylene train, which added to the two polyethylene trains already in operation. 
       
           (1)  
    Excludes prior period sales of recent divestitures including the chlorine value chain, divested on October 5, 2015 (primarily Performance Materials   Chemicals and Performance Plastics), the AgroFresh business, divested on July 31, 2015 (Agricultural Sciences), ANGUS Chemical Company, divested on February 2, 2015 (Performance Materials   Chemicals) and the global Sodium Borohydride business, divested on January 30, 2015 (Performance Materials   Chemicals). Also excludes current period sales related to the ownership restructure of Dow Corning announced on June 1, 2016 (Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions) and sales from January 1, 2016 through April 30, 2016 for the step acquisition of Univation Technologies, LLC, acquired on May 5, 2015 (Performance Plastics).

  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin was   $2.6 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down slightly from   $2.7 billion   in the   third   quarter of last year. Gross margin in the   third   quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by a $212 million charge related to the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the DCC Transaction, reflected in Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions, and by a $28 million charge for costs associated with transactions and productivity actions, reflected in Corporate. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted by a $6 million charge related to transactions and productivity actions. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the DCC Transaction. Excluding these certain items,

     Table of Contents  

gross margin increased as higher sales volume, lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs, cost cutting and productivity initiatives, and the favorable impact from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business more than offset lower selling prices. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, gross margin was   $8.1 billion  , down from   $8.3 billion   in the first   nine   months of 2015. Gross margin in the first nine months of 2016 was negatively impacted by a $317 million charge related to the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the DCC Transaction, reflected in Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions, and an $85 million charge for costs associated with transactions and productivity actions, reflected in Corporate. Gross margin in the first nine months of 2015 was negatively impacted by a $12 million charge related to the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the Univation Technologies, LLC ("Univation") step acquisition, reflected in Performance Plastics, and a $6 million charge for costs associated with transactions and productivity actions, reflected in Corporate. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the DCC Transaction and the Univation transaction. Excluding these certain items, gross margin increased compared with the same period last year as lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs, cost cutting and productivity initiatives, decreased planned maintenance turnaround spending and the favorable impact from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business more than offset lower selling prices.  
    
  Operating Rate 
  The Company s global plant operating rate was   86 percent   of capacity in the   third   quarter of   2016  , flat with the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company's global plant operating rate was   85 percent  , unchanged from the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Personnel Count 
  Personnel count was approximately 59,000 at   September 30, 2016  , up from approximately 49,000 at   December 31, 2015   and up from approximately 52,000 at   September 30, 2015  . Headcount increased from December 31, 2015 as a result of the DCC Transaction which was partially offset by declines related to the Company's restructuring programs and a reduction in the number of seasonal employees. 
    
  Research and Development Expenses 
  Research and development ("R D") expenses totaled   $399 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up $17 million (4 percent) from   $382 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased spending from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. For the first   nine   months of   2016  , R D expenses totaled   $1,159 million  , down from   $1,194 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to cost cutting and productivity initiatives and lower expenses as a result of recent divestitures which more than offset increased spending from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  SG A expenses were   $864 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up $175 million (25 percent) from   $689 million   in the third quarter of last year. SG A in the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by a $135 million charge for costs associated with transactions and productivity actions, reflected in Corporate ($10 million for the third quarter of 2015). Excluding these certain items, SG A in the third quarter of 2016 increased compared with the same period last year as higher spending from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business more than offset lower expenses as a result of recent divestitures. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, SG A expenses totaled   $2,393 million  , up from   $2,214 million   for the first nine months of 2015. SG A in the first nine months of 2016 was negatively impacted by a $250 million charge for costs associated with transactions and productivity actions, reflected in Corporate ($16 million for the first nine months of 2015). Excluding these certain items, SG A for the first nine months of 2016 decreased compared with the same period last year as a result of recent divestitures which more than offset higher spending from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. 

Amortization of Intangibles 
  Amortization of intangibles was   $162 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up from   $105 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015. In the first   nine   months of 2016, amortization of intangibles was   $387 million  , up from   $316 million   in the same period last year. The increase in amortization is due to an increase in intangible assets as a result of the DCC Transaction. See Notes   4   and   6   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on intangible assets. 
    
  Restructuring Charges 
  On June 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan that incorporates actions related to the DCC Transaction. These actions, aligned with Dow s value growth and synergy targets, will result in a global workforce reduction of approximately   2,500   positions, with most of these positions resulting from synergies related to the DCC Transaction. These actions are expected to be completed during the next   two   years. As a result, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of   $449 million   in the second quarter of 2016 consisting of severance charges of   $268 million  , asset

     Table of Contents  

write-downs and write-offs of   $153 million   and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of   $28 million   and are reflected in the Company's segments results as follows:   $28 million   in Consumer Solutions,   $97 million   in Infrastructure Solutions,   $10 million   in Performance Plastics and   $314 million   in Corporate. 
    
  On April 29, 2015, Dow's Board of Directors approved actions to further streamline the organization and optimize the Company s footprint as a result of the separation of a significant portion of Dow s chlorine value chain. These actions, which will further accelerate Dow s value growth and productivity targets, will result in a reduction of approximately 1,750 positions across a number of businesses and functions and adjustments to the Company's asset footprint to enhance competitiveness. These actions are expected to be completed primarily by March 31, 2017. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $375 million in the second quarter of 2015 consisting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities of $10 million, severance costs of $196 million and asset write-downs and write-offs of $169 million. The impact of this charge was reflected in the Company's segment results as follows: $14 million in Agricultural Sciences, $67 million in Consumer Solutions, $27 million in Infrastructure Solutions, $12 million in Performance Plastics and $255 million in Corporate. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an unfavorable adjustment to the 2015 restructuring charge related to additional accruals for exit and disposal activities of   $1 million  , reflected in Agricultural Sciences, offset by a favorable adjustment of   $1 million   for the impairment of long-lived assets, reflected in Infrastructure Solutions. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an unfavorable adjustment to the 2015 restructuring charge related to additional accruals for exit and disposal activities of   $5 million  , reflected in Agricultural Sciences (  $4 million  ) and Consumer Solutions (  $1 million  ). In the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a favorable adjustment to the 2015 restructuring charge related to the impairment of long-lived assets of   $2 million  , reflected in Infrastructure Solutions. See Note   3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's restructuring activities. 
    
  Equity in Earnings of Nonconsolidated Affiliates 
  Dow's share of the earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was   $70 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down from   $135 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015. In the first   nine   months of 2016, Dow's share of the earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was   $191 million  , down from   $575 million   in the first   nine   months of 2015. The decline in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates for the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to higher equity losses at Sadara related to start-up expenses, lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures due to lower monoethylene glycol prices and a reduction in the ownership of MEGlobal (now part of EQUATE), and the DCC Transaction. Equity earnings for the first nine months of 2016 also declined due to a charge of $22 million for a loss on early redemption of debt incurred by Dow Corning and reflected in Consumer Solutions ($8 million) and Infrastructure Solutions ($14 million).  
    
  Sundry Income (Expense) - Net 
  Sundry income (expense)   net includes a variety of income and expense items such as the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments and assets, and litigation. Sundry income (expense)   net in the   third   quarter of   2016   was net expense of   $4 million  , a decrease of   $636 million   compared with net income of   $632 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   third   quarter of 2016 included a $33 million charge for an obligation related to the split-off of the Company's chlorine value chain (reflected in Corporate). The third quarter of 2015 included a $621 million gain related to the divestiture of the AgroFresh business (net of a $3 million loss for mark-to-market adjustments on warrants and reflected in Agricultural Sciences) and a gain on the sale of an Agricultural Sciences subsidiary which more than offset foreign currency exchange losses and $35 million of costs associated with transactions and productivity actions (reflected in Corporate). 
    
  Year to date, sundry income (expense) - net was net income of   $1,305 million  , a decrease of   $375 million   compared with net income of   $1,680 million   in the same period last year. In addition to the amounts previously discussed, the first nine months of 2016 included a   $1,235 million   loss related to the Company's settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and the opt-out cases litigation (reflected in Performance Materials   Chemicals), a   $2,445 million   gain related to the DCC Transaction (reflected in Consumer Solutions (  $1,301 million  ) and Infrastructure Solutions (  $1,144 million  )), a   $6 million   gain adjustment on the split-off of the Company's chlorine value chain (reflected in Performance Materials   Chemicals), gains on sales of assets and investments, and foreign currency exchange losses. The first nine months of 2015 included the amounts previously discussed, a $670 million gain on the divestiture of ANGUS Chemical Company and an $18 million gain on the divestiture of the global Sodium Borohydride business (both reflected in Performance Materials   Chemicals), a $361 million gain on the Univation step acquisition (reflected in Performance Plastics) and gains on sales of assets and investments which more than offset foreign currency exchange losses and $69 million of costs associated with transactions and productivity actions (reflected in Corporate). See Notes   4   and   11   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense (interest expense less capitalized interest and interest income) was   $194 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down from   $215 million   in the   third   quarter of last year. Year to date, net interest expense was   $565 million   compared with   $660 million   in the first   nine   months of 2015. The decline primarily reflects the effect of debt retired in 2015. Interest income was   $26 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   $18 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  , and   $64 million   for the first   nine   months of 2016, compared with   $46 million   in the first   nine   months of 2015.  
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, reinvestment assertions regarding foreign income and the level of income relative to tax credits available. For example, as the percentage of foreign sourced income increases, the Company's effective tax rate declines. The Company's tax rate is also influenced by the level of equity earnings, since most of the earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level.  
    
  The effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   24.9 percent  , down from   30.4 percent   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The tax rate in the third quarter of 2015 reflected the impact of the AgroFresh divestiture, including non-deductible items and the geographic mix of the gain. For the first nine months of 2016, the effective tax rate was   6.3 percent   compared with   28.2 percent   for the first nine months of 2015. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 declined due to the non-taxable gain on the DCC Transaction, a tax benefit on the reassessment of a deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in the Company s investment in Dow Corning and a tax benefit related to the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases settlements which more than offset a $57 million tax charge related to the adjustment of an uncertain tax position. The tax rate for the first nine months of 2015 reflected the impact of non-deductible items related to divestiture transactions which were partially offset by a non-taxable gain on the Univation step acquisition. 
    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was   $14 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , down from   $61 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . For the first   nine   months of 2016, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was   $54 million   compared with   $79 million   in the same period last year. The decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to the Company's purchase of noncontrolling interests. See Note   14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  Preferred Stock Dividends 
  Preferred stock dividends of   $85 million   were recognized in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   (  $255 million   in the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015), related to the Company s Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. 
    
  Net Income Available for Common Stockholders 
  Net income available for common stockholders was   $719 million  , or   $0.63   per share, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   $1,290 million  , or   $1.09   per share, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net income available for common stockholders for the first   nine   months of 2016 was   $4,011 million  , or   $3.48   per share, compared with   $3,818 million  , or   $3.24   per share for the same period of 2015. See Note   17   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Company's earnings per share calculations.

Certain Items Impacting Results 
  The Company provides certain financial measures - Income before income taxes, Net income and Earnings per share - excluding the impact of certain items ("non-GAAP" financial measures). Due to the nature of these certain items, they do not reflect the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, Dow's management believes presenting financial measures excluding certain items is useful for investors as it provides financial information on a more comparative basis for the periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized in accordance with principles generally accepted in the United State of America ("U.S. GAAP") and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. In addition, these measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP measures.  
    
  The following tables summarize the impact of certain items recorded in the   three  - and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

              (4) 
    For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  , conversion of the Company' Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A ("Preferred Stock") into shares of the Company's common stock was excluded from the calculation of "Diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude certain items" as well as the earnings per share impact of certain items because the effect of including them would have been antidilutive. 
              (5) 
    For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  , an assumed conversion of the Company's Preferred Stock into shares of the Company's common stock was included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share (reported U.S. GAAP amount). 
              (6) 
    The Company used "Net Income Attributable to The Dow Chemical Company" when calculating diluted earnings per share (reported U.S. GAAP amount) for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  , as it excludes quarterly preferred dividends of $85 million.

OUTLOOK  
  Dow sees steady growth in North America and Europe continuing, with the Company's new innovations and products outpacing the market. The strength of the consumer and emphasis on growth in Southeast Asia and second-tier cities in China continue to drive Dow's results in Asia Pacific. Latin America is showing strength in the Andean economies and Mexico, and Brazil is beginning to recover from a low base.  
    
  Consumer-led demand remains a notable bright spot, and Dow expects continued robust growth fundamentals in its core markets of packaging, automotive and construction, adjusting for traditional end-of-year seasonality. The Company's competitive advantages in these attractive, high-growth markets continue to be further enhanced by the growth synergies inherent in the Dow Corning integration. 
    
  Going forward, the Dow team remains relentlessly focused on its priorities - delivering the operating and financial plan through disciplined execution on margin and volume management, self-help and cost cutting; accelerating earnings growth and value creation through the continued integration of Dow Corning; and successfully closing the DowDuPont transaction. Dow's financial performance fuels its excitement about the future and confidence in the path toward the intended creation of three focused, industry-leading companies that will further maximize shareholder value. 

SEGMENT RESULTS 
  The Company uses EBITDA (which Dow defines as earnings (i.e., "Net Income") before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as its measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes. EBITDA by operating segment includes all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to the Company as a whole are assigned to Corporate. In the segment discussions that follow, the Company provides EBITDA excluding certain items. Due to the nature of these certain items, they do not reflect the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, Dow's management believes presenting EBITDA excluding certain items is useful for investors as it provides financial information on a more comparative basis for the periods presented. EBITDA excluding certain items is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. Additional information regarding the Company s operating segments and a reconciliation of EBITDA to  Income Before Income Taxes  can be found in Note   21   to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  Dow Corning Ownership Restructure 
  On June 1, 2016, the Company announced the closing of the DCC Transaction.

AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES 
  The Agricultural Sciences segment is a global leader in providing crop protection and seed/plant biotechnology products and technologies, urban pest management solutions and healthy oils. The business invents, develops, manufactures and markets products for use in agricultural, industrial and commercial pest management, and food service. Agricultural Sciences consists of two businesses - Crop Protection and Seeds. 
    
  On January 30, 2015, Dow AgroSciences LLC acquired Coodetec's seed business. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this acquisition. 
    
  On July 31, 2015, the Company sold its AgroFresh business to AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. ( AFSI ). The AgroFresh business was reported in the Agricultural Sciences segment through the date of divestiture. The Company has retained a minority interest in AFSI which is also reported in the Agricultural Sciences segment.  

Agricultural Sciences sales were $1,235 million in the third quarter of 2016, up 6 percent from $1,167 million in the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the same quarter last year, volume increased 3 percent and price increased 3 percent, including the favorable impact of currency which represented approximately 25 percent of the price increase. Sales increased primarily as a result of strong Seeds demand in Latin America which more than offset sales declines in all other geographic areas. Seeds sales increased 59 percent compared with the third quarter of 2015 on strong demand for corn and soybean seeds in Latin America. Crop Protection sales declined 2 percent compared with the third quarter of 2015, as lower prices for generic herbicides and reduced demand for fungicides more than offset demand growth in Latin America.   
    
  EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $101 million, compared with $582 million in the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by a $1 million restructuring charge adjustment. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 was positively impacted by a pretax gain of $621 million related to the divestiture of AgroFresh. See Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these items. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA increased compared with the same period last year due to higher sales volume, primarily for corn seeds, new product introductions, increased selling prices, and benefits from lower operating costs driven by productivity initiatives.  
    
  Agricultural Sciences sales were $4,458 million for the first nine months of 2016, down 6 percent from $4,778 million in the first nine months of 2015. Compared with the same period last year, volume decreased 5 percent and price decreased 1 percent. Agricultural Sciences reported sales declines in all geographic areas, except Latin America. Sales declined as a result of the AgroFresh divestiture, product lines sold in 2015, currency headwinds and lower crop commodity prices. Crop Protection sales decreased 8 percent compared with the first nine months of 2015, driven primarily by volume declines which reflected the AgroFresh divestiture and reduced demand for herbicides and insecticides. Seeds sales were flat compared with the first nine months of 2015, as strong demand for corn seeds in Latin America was offset by soft demand for sunflower seeds. Excluding divestitures, volume for the segment was down 4 percent. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, EBITDA was $732 million, down $514 million from $1,246 million in the first nine months of 2015. In addition to the certain items previously discussed, EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was negatively impacted by $4 million of 2015 restructuring charge adjustments. EBITDA for the first nine months of 2015 was negatively impacted by $14 million of restructuring charges. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA increased compared with the same period last year as benefits from lower operating costs, primarily from productivity initiatives, more than offset lower sales volume, lower selling prices (driven primarily by currency) and the absence of earnings from AgroFresh and other product lines sold in 2015.

U.S. federal regulatory approvals have been obtained for the commercialization of ENLIST  Corn, Soybeans and Cotton, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") registration of ENLIST DUO  for use with ENLIST  Corn and Soybeans in 15 key states. The Company has also secured approval of the registration of ENLIST E3  Soybeans in Argentina and approval of the registration of ENLIST E3  Soybeans, ENLIST  Soybean Seeds and ENLIST  Corn Seeds in Brazil and Canada. ENLIST DUO  is also approved for use with ENLIST  crops in Canada. Regulatory approvals for ENLIST  products in certain other countries are still pending. After the EPA s registration of ENLIST DUO  for use with ENLIST  Corn and Soybeans, the National Resources Defense Council, Center for Food Safety and other organizations filed suit against the EPA to set aside the registration in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the "Court"), and Dow AgroSciences intervened in the cases. In late November 2015, the EPA filed a motion to vacate and remand the registration to the EPA. Dow AgroSciences opposed the motion to vacate the registration. On January 25, 2016, the Court denied the EPA s motion to vacate the registration, so this case has now concluded. The ENLIST DUO  registration for use with ENLIST  Corn and Soybeans remains fully intact. 

CONSUMER SOLUTIONS 
  The Consumer Solutions segment consists of four global businesses   Consumer Care, Dow Automotive Systems, Dow Electronic Materials and Consumer Solutions - Silicones. This segment also includes a portion of the Company s share of the results of Dow Corning, a joint venture of the Company, through May 31, 2016. Consumer Care includes Dow Home, Institutional   Personal Care Solutions, Dow Pharma and Food Solutions, and SAFECHEM. Dow Automotive Systems includes Adhesives and Performance Solutions. Dow Electronic Materials includes Semiconductor Technologies, Interconnect Technologies, Display Technologies and Growth Technologies. Consumer Solutions - Silicones includes Beauty and Personal Care, Household Care, Healthcare, Consumer Goods and Automotive.  
    
  As of June 1, 2016, Dow Corning, previously a 50:50 joint venture with Corning, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow as a result of the DCC Transaction. Dow and Corning continue to maintain their historical proportional equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group ("HSC Group"). Beginning in June 2016, the results of Dow Corning, excluding the HSC Group, are fully consolidated into the Company's consolidated statements of income and aligned with the Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments. The results of the HSC Group will continue to be reported as "Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates" in the Company's consolidated statements of income and aligned with Consumer Solutions and Infrastructure Solutions segments. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this transaction. 

Consumer Solutions sales were $1,575 million in the third quarter of 2016, up from $1,108 million in the third quarter of 2015. Sales increased 42 percent from the third quarter of 2015 with volume up 45 percent and price down 3 percent. Compared with the same quarter last year, volume increased in all geographic areas, primarily reflecting the impact of Consumer Solutions - Silicones. Excluding the impact of Consumer Solutions - Silicones, volume increased 3 percent with increases in all businesses. Dow Automotive Systems volume increased, notably in Asia Pacific, driven by demand for Dow's light-weighting technologies. Dow Electronic Materials reported volume growth in Asia Pacific due to strong demand for chemical mechanical planarization pads and slurries, organic light-emitting diode materials, and printed circuit board technologies used in smartphones. Consumer Care volume increased due to market share and innovation gains in the home and personal care market sectors in EMEAI, which more than offset customer de-stocking of cellulosics used in pharmaceutical applications and the shutdown of a cellulosics facility in Institute, West Virginia, in the fourth quarter of 2015. Price declined in all businesses and all geographic areas. Price declined in Dow Automotive Systems in response to lower raw material prices. Price declined in Dow Electronic Materials due to a decrease in precious metal prices and competitive pricing pressures, which more than offset

     Table of Contents  

the favorable impact of currency in Asia Pacific. Price declined in Consumer Care driven by competitive pricing pressures for home care products. 
    
  EBITDA in the third quarter of 2016 was $375 million, up from $289 million in the third quarter of 2015. Compared with the same quarter last year, EBITDA was negatively impacted by a pretax loss of $117 million related to the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the DCC Transaction. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this certain item. Excluding this certain item, EBITDA improved from the same quarter last year as earnings from Consumer Solutions - Silicones and higher sales volume more than offset the impact of lower selling prices. 
    
  Consumer Solutions sales were $3,894 million for the first nine months of 2016, up 17 percent from $3,327 million in the first nine months of 2015. Compared with the same period last year, volume was up 21 percent and price was down 4 percent. Excluding the impact of Consumer Solutions - Silicones, volume increased 2 percent. On the same basis, volume increased in all businesses and all geographic areas while price declined in all businesses and all geographic areas. 
    
  EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was $2,260 million, up from $744 million in the first nine months of 2015. In addition to the certain item previously discussed, EBITDA was favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $1,301 million on the DCC Transaction. EBITDA was negatively impacted by $28 million of 2016 restructuring charges, a pretax loss of $30 million associated with the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the DCC Transaction, a pretax loss of $8 million related to the early redemption of debt incurred by Dow Corning, and a $1 million unfavorable adjustment related to the Company s 2015 restructuring program. EBITDA for the first nine months of 2015 was negatively impacted by $67 million of restructuring charges. See Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these certain items. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 improved compared with the same period last year as earnings from Consumer Solutions - Silicones, higher sales volume, lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs and lower operating costs due to cost cutting and productivity initiatives more than offset the impact of lower selling prices. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS 
  The Infrastructure Solutions segment consists of the following businesses: Dow Building   Construction, Dow Coating Materials, Energy   Water Solutions, Performance Monomers and Infrastructure Solutions - Silicones. This segment also includes a portion of the Company s share of the results of Dow Corning, a joint venture of the Company, through May 31, 2016.

reduce its merchant acrylic monomer exposure, which more than offset increased demand for vinyl acetate monomers, most notably in EMEAI. Volume decreased in Energy   Water Solutions in all geographic areas due to soft demand for reverse osmosis membranes used in industrial applications and continued weakness in the energy sector. Dow Coating Materials volume increased, principally in Asia Pacific, due to growth in both architectural and industrial coatings. Dow Building   Construction reported modest volume growth driven by demand for construction chemicals, most notably in Asia Pacific. Price was down in all geographic areas and all businesses in response to lower raw material prices and competitive pricing pressures. 
    
  EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $285 million, compared with $325 million in the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by a pretax loss of $95 million related to the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the DCC Transaction and favorably impacted by a $1 million adjustment related to the Company s 2015 restructuring program. See Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these certain items. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA improved compared with the same quarter last year as earnings from Infrastructure Solutions - Silicones and lower other raw material costs more than offset the impact of lower selling prices. 
    
  Infrastructure Solutions sales were $6,213 million for the first nine months of 2016, up 9 percent from $5,689 million in the first nine months of 2015. Compared with the same period last year, volume was up 16 percent and price was down 7 percent. Excluding the impact of Infrastructure Solutions - Silicones, volume decreased 2 percent. On the same basis, volume declines in Performance Monomers and Energy   Water Solutions more than offset volume increases in Dow Building   Construction and Dow Coating Materials. Volume decreased in all geographic areas, except Asia Pacific. Price declined in all geographic areas and all businesses. 
    
  EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was $1,968 million, up from $860 million in the first nine months of 2015. In addition to the certain items listed above, EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $1,144 million on the DCC Transaction.

  The Performance Materials   Chemicals segment consists of the following businesses: Chlor-Alkali and Vinyl, Industrial Solutions and Polyurethanes. The segment also includes a portion of the results of EQUATE, The Kuwait Olefins Company K.S.C. ("TKOC"), Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company. 
    
  On January 30, 2015, the Company sold its global Sodium Borohydride business to Vertellus Specialty Materials LLC. On February 2, 2015, the Company sold ANGUS Chemical Company to Golden Gate Capital. On October 5, 2015, the Company completed the split-off of its U.S. Gulf Coast Chlor-Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics and Global Epoxy businesses to Olin Corporation in a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. These businesses were reported in the Performance Materials   Chemicals segment through the date of divestiture. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Performance Materials   Chemicals sales were $2,367 million in the third quarter of 2016, down 25 percent from $3,142 million in the third quarter of 2015, with volume down 16 percent and price down 9 percent. Compared with the same quarter last year, price declined in all geographic areas and all businesses due to lower raw material prices and competitive pricing pressures. Volume was impacted by the recent split-off of the chlorine value chain. Excluding this divestiture, volume increased 4 percent. Polyurethanes volume increased, driven by double-digit volume growth in Asia Pacific and EMEAI for polyols and polyurethane systems products, which more than offset volume decreases in North America and Latin America. Industrial Solutions volume increased in all geographic areas, except Latin America, driven by strong demand for heat transfer fluids used in solar applications, most notably in EMEAI, and strong demand for oxygenated solvents. Chlor-Alkali and Vinyl volume was flat, reflecting the impact of planned maintenance turnaround activity. 
    
  EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $322 million, down from $540 million in the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA decreased from the same quarter last year primarily due to lower selling prices, decreased sales volume, a decline in equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures due to lower monoethylene glycol prices and a reduced ownership position in MEGlobal, higher equity losses from Sadara related to start-up expenses, and the absence of earnings from the chlorine value chain which more than offset the impact of lower R D and SG A spending and lower operating expenses. 
    
  In the first nine months of 2016, Performance Materials   Chemicals sales were $6,812 million, down from $9,592 million in the first nine months of 2015. Compared with the same period last year, volume decreased 18 percent while price declined 11 percent. Excluding the impact of recent divestitures, volume increased 2 percent. Volume gains in Polyurethanes, in Asia Pacific and EMEAI, and Chlor-Alkali and Vinyl in EMEAI more than offset declines in Industrial Solutions. Price declined in all businesses and all geographic areas. 
    
  EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was a loss of $277 million, compared with a gain of $2,335 million in the first nine months of 2015. EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was negatively impacted by a pretax loss of $1,235 million related to the settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases litigation and favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $6 million related to post-closing adjustments on the split-off of the chlorine value chain. EBITDA for the first nine months of 2015 was favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $670 million on the divestiture of ANGUS Chemical Company and a pretax gain of $18 million on the divestiture of the global Sodium Borohydride business. See Notes 4 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these certain items. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA decreased compared with the same period last year as lower selling prices, decreased sales volume, lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures, higher equity losses from Sadara related to start-up expenses, and the absence of earnings from the chlorine value chain more than offset the impact of lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs, lower R D and SG A spending and lower operating costs.

PERFORMANCE PLASTICS 
  The Performance Plastics segment is a market-oriented portfolio comprised of Dow Elastomers, Dow Electrical and Telecommunications, Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics, Energy and Hydrocarbons. The segment also includes the results of The Kuwait Styrene Company K.S.C. ("TKSC"), The SCG-Dow Group as well as a portion of the results of EQUATE, TKOC, Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company. 
    
  On   May 5, 2015  , Univation Technologies, LLC ("Univation"), previously a 50:50 joint venture between Dow and ExxonMobil, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow as a result of ExxonMobil redeeming its entire equity interest in Univation in exchange for certain assets and liabilities of Univation. Prior to this transaction, the Company's share of Univation's results of operations was reported as "Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in May 2015, Univation's results of operations are fully consolidated in the Company's consolidated statements of income. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  Sales for the Energy business are primarily opportunistic merchant sales driven by market conditions and sales to customers located on Dow manufacturing sites. Sales for the Hydrocarbons business are comprised primarily of monomers and ethylene by-products that are not required for internal use. Hydrocarbons sales can fluctuate significantly based on ethylene production facility feedslates and operating rates, derivative demand and market prices for monomers and by-products.  

Performance Plastics sales in the third quarter of 2016 were $4,702 million, up 1 percent from $4,665 million in the third quarter of 2015 with volume up 10 percent and price down 9 percent. Price was down in all geographic areas and all businesses in response to lower feedstock, energy and other raw material prices. Volume was up in all businesses and all geographic areas, except Latin America. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, volume increased 11 percent. Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics volume increased in North America and EMEAI due to increased demand for industrial and consumer packaging applications, which more than offset volume declines in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Dow Elastomers volume increased in Asia Pacific and North America due to higher demand for transportation, infrastructure and consumer goods which more than offset volume declines in EMEAI. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications volume increased in Latin America and North America due to demand for power cable installations and fiber optics which more than offset volume declines in Asia Pacific and EMEAI. Volume increased in the Hydrocarbons and Energy businesses due to supply agreements with Olin Corporation as a result of the split-off of the chlorine value chain in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  EBITDA in the third quarter of 2016 was $1,251 million, down from $1,349 million in the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA decreased compared with the third quarter of 2015 as the impact of lower selling prices, higher maintenance turnaround spending and increased equity losses from Sadara related to start-up expenses more than offset the impact of lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs, higher sales volume and improved equity earnings from The SCG-Dow Group. 
    
  Performance Plastics sales for the first nine months of 2016 were $13,561 million, a decrease of 1 percent from $13,740 million in the first nine months of 2015. Compared with the same period last year, price decreased 12 percent and volume increased         11 percent. Price declined in all geographic areas and all businesses as a result of lower feedstock, energy and other raw material prices. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, volume was up 13 percent with increases in all businesses and geographic areas.

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION  
  The Company had cash and cash equivalents of   $7,032 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $8,577 million   at   December 31, 2015  , of which $5,565 million at   September 30, 2016   and $6,494 million at   December 31, 2015   was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. A deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the United States. At   September 30, 2016  , management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. However, in the unusual event that additional foreign funds are needed in the United States, the Company has the ability to repatriate additional funds. The repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. It is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings. 
    
  The Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , cash provided by operating activities decreased compared with the same period last year, primarily due to cash payments related to the settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases litigation. 

(1)    Presented in accordance with newly implemented ASU 2015-17. See Note   1   to the 
  Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  Net working capital decreased from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a decrease in "Cash and cash equivalents" related to the settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases litigation and an increase in "Accounts payable" which were partially offset by increases in "Accounts and notes receivable" and "Inventories," reflecting the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. Days-sales-outstanding-in-receivables increased 1 day in the first   nine   months of   2016  . Days-sales-in-inventory increased 4 days in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , cash used in investing activities was $  2,498 million  , primarily due to capital expenditures, including U.S. Gulf Coast projects, and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara, which were partially offset by net cash acquired in the DCC Transaction. In the first   nine   months of 2015, cash used in investing activities was $  1,240 million  , primarily due to capital expenditures, including U.S. Gulf Coast projects, and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara, which were partially offset by proceeds received on divestitures, including ANGUS Chemical Company, the global Sodium Borohydride business and the AgroFresh business.

     Table of Contents  

Capital spending was   $2,877 million   in the first   nine   months of 2016, compared with   $2,817 million   in the first   nine   months of 2015. The Company expects capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $3.9 billion. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of 2016, the Company loaned an additional   $831 million   to Sadara and converted approximately   $880 million   of the loan balance into equity. The Company expects to loan approximately $340 million to Sadara during the remainder of 2016. All or a portion of the outstanding loans to Sadara could potentially be converted into equity in future periods.  
    
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , cash used in financing activities increased compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher payments on long-term debt, reduced proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and increased payments made to purchase a noncontrolling interest. 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
  The Company's management believes that free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides relevant and meaningful information to investors about the Company's ability to generate cash after investing in its asset base. Free cash flow represents the cash that remains available to fund obligations using the Company's primary source of incremental liquidity - cash provided by operating activities. This financial measure is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow to "Cash provided by operating activities" for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  : 

Liquidity   Financial Flexibility 
  The Company s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash provided by operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and the Company's ability to access debt markets is expected to meet the Company s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, dividend payments, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans and other needs. In addition to cash provided by operating activities, the Company s current liquidity sources also include U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper, committed credit facilities, and accounts receivable securitization facilities. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows: 
    
  Commercial Paper 
  Dow issues promissory notes under its U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The Company maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates. 
    
  Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities 
  The Company has access to committed accounts receivable securitization facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific, from which amounts available for funding are based upon available and eligible accounts receivable within each of the facilities. The Asia Pacific facilities are renewed annually. The Europe facility was renewed in July 2015 for a term that extends to July 2018. The Company renewed the United States facility in June 2015 for a term that extends to June 2018. See Note   12   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

     Table of Contents  

Committed Credit Facilities 
  In the event Dow has short-term liquidity needs and is unable to issue commercial paper for any reason, Dow has the ability to access liquidity through its committed and available credit facilities, as summarized below: 

In connection with the DCC Transaction, on May 31, 2016, Dow Corning incurred $4.5 billion of indebtedness under a certain third party credit agreement ("DCC Term Loan Facility") in order to fund the contribution of cash to Splitco. Subsequent to the DCC Transaction, the Company guaranteed the obligations of Dow Corning under the DCC Term Loan Facility and, as a result, the covenants and events of default applicable to the DCC Term Loan Facility are substantially similar to the covenants and events of default set forth in the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the DCC Term Loan Facility are repayable on May 30, 2017, subject to a 364-day extension option, at Dow Corning's election, upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent. Dow Corning intends to exercise the 364-day extension option on the DCC Term Loan Facility. See Note 4 for additional information on the DCC Transaction. 
    
  Shelf Registration - U.S. 
  The Company s shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for an unspecified amount of mixed securities expired on February 19, 2016. In addition, a prospectus supplement that registered an unlimited amount of securities for issuance under the Company s InterNotes program also expired on February 19, 2016. Due to the pending transaction with DuPont in which the Company and DuPont will combine in an all-stock merger of equals strategic combination, the Company did not renew the shelf registration or file a new prospectus supplement for the InterNotes program. However, the Company remains prepared to renew the shelf registration and file a new prospectus supplement for the InterNotes program with the SEC. 
    
  Shelf Registration - Japan 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had Japanese yen 50 billion (approximately $490 million) of securities available for issuance under a shelf registration renewed with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of Japan effective December 13, 2014, which will expire on December 12, 2016. The Company does not intend to renew this shelf registration when it expires in December.

Debt 
  As Dow continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt, as Dow believes this is the best representation of the Company s financial leverage at this point in time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus "Cash and cash equivalents." At   September 30, 2016  , net debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 32 percent. This increase was primarily due to debt assumed in the DCC Transaction.

    Presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs. See Note   13   to the Consolidated 
     Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  Dow's public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. The Company's most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of the Company's consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement ("Revolving Credit Facility") equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of the Company's consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.40 to 1.00 at   September 30, 2016  . Management believes the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at   September 30, 2016  . For information on Dow's covenants and default provisions, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Management expects that the Company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations. 
    
  Credit Ratings 
  The Company's credit ratings are as follows:

Downgrades in the Company's credit ratings would increase borrowing costs on certain indentures and could have a negative impact on the Company's ability to access credit markets. 
    
  Dividends  
  On September 7, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share, payable October 28, 2016, to stockholders of record on September 30, 2016. Since 1912, the Company has maintained or increased the amount of the quarterly dividend, adjusted for stock splits, with the exception of February 12, 2009. During this 105-year period, Dow has increased the amount of the quarterly dividend 52 times (approximately 13 percent of the time), reduced the dividend once and maintained the amount of the quarterly dividend approximately 87 percent of the time.    
    
  On September 7, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $85 million to Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A shareholders of record on September 15, 2016, which was paid on October 3, 2016.

Share Repurchase Program 
  On February 13, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share buy-back program, authorizing up to $1.5 billion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company's common stock over a period of time. On January 29, 2014, the Board of Directors announced an expansion of the Company's share buy-back authorization, authorizing an additional amount not to exceed $3 billion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company's common stock over a period of time. On November 12, 2014, the Board of Directors announced a new $5 billion tranche to its share buy-back program. As a result of these actions, the total authorized amount of the share repurchase program is $9.5 billion. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately $1.9 billion of the share buy-back program authorization remained available for additional repurchases.  
    
  On December 11, 2015, the Company and DuPont announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals strategic combination. The combined company will be named DowDuPont. As a result of the planned merger of equals with DuPont, the Company determined that it would not repurchase shares until after the July 20, 2016, shareholder vote on the DowDuPont merger. The Company resumed share repurchases in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  For additional information related to the share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  Pension Plans  
  The Company has defined benefit pension plans in the United States and a number of other countries. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed the DCC Transaction and assumed the sponsorship of Dow Corning's qualified and non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Company's funding policy is to contribute to the plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. See Note   15   to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for additional information concerning the Company's pension plans. 
    
  Restructuring 
  The activities related to the 2015 and 2016 restructuring programs are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of $344 million, primarily through June 30, 2018, related to severance costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including environmental remediation (see Note   3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities, as the Company continually looks for ways to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of its operations, and to ensure competitiveness across its businesses and geographic areas. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities and restructuring plan implementation costs; these costs will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Off-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required to consolidate the entities (see Note   14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note   12   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets. 
    
  Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. The Company had outstanding guarantees at   September 30, 2016   of   $5,801 million  , down from   $5,822 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Dow s critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s 2015 10-K. Since December 31, 2015, there have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies. 
    
  Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation 
  Union Carbide Corporation ( Union Carbide ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide s premises, and Union Carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. ( Amchem ). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide s products. 
    
  It is the opinion of Dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of Union Carbide disposing of its asbestos-related claims, including future defense costs, could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the Company.

     Table of Contents  

The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants. Union Carbide had a significant increase in the number of claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved in 2015, resulting from a detailed review of the status of individual claims and an update to criteria used to classify claims. 

Plaintiffs  lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. In fact, there are no personal injury cases in which only Union Carbide and/or Amchem are the sole named defendants. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.

The Dow Chemical Company and Subsidiaries 
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION, Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative 
  Disclosures About Market Risk. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company s results. 
     
  The global nature of Dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. As a result of investments, production facilities and other operations on a global basis, the Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows, keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps, and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities. The largest exposures are denominated in European currencies, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, although exposures also exist in other currencies of Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, Africa and India. 
     
  The main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. Dow uses interest rate swaps,  swaptions,  and exchange-traded instruments to accomplish this objective. The Company s primary exposure is to the U.S. dollar yield curve. 
    
  Dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries. This exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the Company s market risk policies and procedures. 
     
  Inherent in Dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. Some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments. Feedstocks for ethylene production and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures. Over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks, when feasible. 
     
  Dow uses value at risk ( VAR ), stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values, given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time, using specified confidence levels. The VAR methodology used by the Company is a variance/covariance model. This model uses a 97.5 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data. The   September 30, 2016  , 2015 year-end and 2015 average daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions are shown below. These amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the Company. 

The Company s daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions increased from a composite VAR of $133 million at December 31, 2015, to a composite VAR of $142 million at September 30, 2016. The increases in the equities VAR and the foreign exchange VAR were due to increased managed exposures coupled with higher volatilities. The increase in the commodities VAR resulted from an increase in commodity volatility. The interest rate VAR was unchanged. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for further disclosure regarding market risk.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Disclosure Committee and the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that was conducted during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation 
  No material developments regarding this matter occurred during the third quarter of 2016. For a summary of the history and current status of this matter, see Note   11   to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation. 
    
  Environmental Matters  
  On August 17, 2016, Dow Corning Corporation ("Dow Corning"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, received notification from the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection ("KDEP") of their intent to assess a civil penalty in excess of $100,000 for alleged air violations at Dow Corning's Carrollton, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. Discussions between Dow Corning and the KDEP are ongoing. 
    
  Rohm and Haas Texas Incorporated ("ROH"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was informed by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), Region 6 of concerns related to the operation and condition of certain flares installed at ROH's Deer Park, Texas, manufacturing facility. The EPA has proposed to resolve this matter with an Administrative Complaint as well as a Consent Agreement and Final Order ("CAFO"). Resolution of this matter may result in a fine in excess of $100,000. Discussions between ROH and the EPA are ongoing. 
    
  Derivative Litigation    
  In April 2016, Stephen Levine ("Levine"), purportedly in the name of and on behalf of the Company, served the Company with a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the  Court ) against certain officers and directors of the Company (the  Defendants ) alleging, among other things, that Defendants breached certain fiduciary obligations with respect to the urethanes antitrust class action litigation and the underlying conduct alleged therein, and the use of corporate assets. Defendants and the Company moved to dismiss the complaint on July 13, 2016, arguing that Levine had not alleged sufficient facts to establish his ability to assert claims on the Company's behalf and that the allegations were not sufficient to state a legal claim. On October 19, 2016, the Court entered an order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
  The following risk factor was updated during   2016  : 
    
  Litigation: The Company is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to commercial matters including product liability, governmental regulation and other actions.  
  Certain of the claims and lawsuits facing the Company purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts. All such claims are contested. With the exception of the possible effect of the asbestos-related liability of Union Carbide Corporation ( Union Carbide ), the Chapter 11 related matters of Dow Corning Corporation ("Dow Corning") and certain urethane matters described below, it is the opinion of the Company's management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. At   September 30, 2016  , Union Carbide's asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims was   $398 million   (  $437 million   at   December 31, 2015  ) and its receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability and defense and resolution costs was   $41 million   (  $61 million   at   December 31, 2015  ). It is the opinion of the Company's management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of Union Carbide disposing of its asbestos-related claims, including future defense costs, could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the Company.  
    
  Dow Corning, a former 50:50 joint venture, in 1995 voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to resolve breast implant liabilities and related matters ("Chapter 11 Proceeding"). Dow Corning emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on June 1, 2004, and is implementing the Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan"). The Plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding and provides a process for the satisfaction of commercial creditor claims in the Chapter 11 Proceeding. At   September 30, 2016  ,  
  
    72 

     Table of Contents  

Dow Corning's liability for breast implant and other product liability claims was   $290 million   and the liability related to commercial creditor claims was   $106 million  . It is the opinion of the Company's management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of Dow Corning disposing of its Chapter 11 liabilities could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the Company. 
    
  The Company is and has been involved in a number of matters alleging a conspiracy to fix the price of various urethane chemical products ( Urethane Matters ). The Urethane Matters included a class action lawsuit ( Class Action Lawsuit ) which went to trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas ( District Court ). On February 20, 2013, the jury returned a damages verdict against the Company in the Class Action Lawsuit in the amount of $400 million, which was ultimately trebled resulting in a judgment of $1.06 billion. The Company subsequently appealed this judgment to the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ( Court of Appeals ) which issued an opinion confirming the District Court s judgment. The Company filed a petition for Rehearing or Rehearing   En Banc   which was denied by the Court of Appeals. The Company then filed a petition for    writ of certiorari    ( Writ Petition ) with the U.S. Supreme Court ("Supreme Court"). On February 26, 2016, the Company announced a proposed settlement for the Class Action Lawsuit under which Dow would pay the plaintiff class $835 million, which includes damages, class attorney fees and post-judgment interest. The agreement was conditioned upon the Supreme Court holding Dow's Writ Petition in abeyance and subsequent approval of the class settlement by the District Court. The proposed settlement resolves the $1.06 billion judgment and any subsequent claim for attorneys' fees, costs and post-judgment interest against Dow. As a result, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $835 million. On March 7, 2016, the Supreme Court approved the joint motion to hold Dow s Writ Petition in abeyance and on April 27, 2016, the District Court provided preliminary approval of the settlement. On May 11, 2016, the Company moved the $835 million settlement amount into an escrow account (per the terms of the Settlement Agreement). The District Court granted final approval of the settlement on July 29, 2016, and the settlement amount was released from escrow on August 30, 2016. The Company continues to believe that it was not part of any conspiracy and the judgment was fundamentally flawed as a matter of class action law. Regardless, the case is now concluded. 
    
  The Urethane Matters also included a series of "opt-out" cases which were filed by a number of large volume purchasers who elected not to be class members. These opt-out cases are substantively identical to the Class Action Lawsuit. A consolidated jury trial of the opt-out cases began on March 8, 2016. On April 5, 2016, the Company entered into a binding settlement for the opt-out cases under which Dow would pay the plaintiffs $400 million, inclusive of damages and attorney fees. Payment of this settlement occurred on May 4, 2016. The Company continues to deny allegations of price fixing and maintains that it was not part of any conspiracy. 

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The following table provides information regarding purchases of the Company s common stock by the Company during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    On February 13, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share buy-back program, authorizing up to $1.5 billion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company s common stock over a period of time. On January 29, 2014, the Board of Directors announced an expansion of the Company's share buy-back authorization, authorizing an additional amount not to exceed $3 billion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company's common stock over a period of time. On November 12, 2014, the Board of Directors announced a new $5 billion tranche to its share buy-back program. As a result of these actions, the total authorized amount of the share repurchase program is $9.5 billion.

On December 11, 2015, the Company and DuPont announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals strategic combination. The combined company will be named DowDuPont. As a result of the planned merger of equals with DuPont, the Company determined that it would not repurchase shares until after the July 20, 2016, shareholder vote on the DowDuPont merger. The Company resumed share repurchases in the third quarter of 2016.

ITEM 5.  OTHER INFORMATION 
  Adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." The Company elected to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis and, as a result, changes have been made to the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015. See Notes   1   and   2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, a change was made to the consolidated balance sheets to reclassify prepaid tax assets of $293 million at December 31, 2015 and $358 million at December 31, 2014, to "Other current assets." A summary of the changes made to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, is included in the following table: 

Information Regarding Internal Separations in Preparation for Intended Business Separations  
  On December 11, 2015, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") and The Dow Chemical Company ("Dow") announced their entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), under which the companies will combine in an all-stock, merger of equals transaction (the "Merger Transaction"), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval or clearance from certain governmental authorities, including those in the United States, European Union, China and Brazil. The combined company will be named DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont"). Following the consummation of the Merger Transaction, the combined company intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont and any required regulatory approvals, the separation of the combined company s agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the "Business Separations").  
    
  It is anticipated that the agriculture business will consist of the businesses that comprise DuPont s agriculture business and that comprise Dow s agricultural sciences business. It is anticipated that the material science business will consist of the businesses that comprise DuPont s performance materials businesses and the businesses that comprise Dow s performance plastics, performance materials and chemicals, infrastructure solutions and the Consumer Care and Dow Automotive Systems portions of consumer solutions business and the businesses of the Dow Corning Corporation (other than the electronics portion of its silicones business). It is anticipated that the specialty products business will consist of the businesses that comprise DuPont s electronics and communications, nutrition and health, industrial biosciences (including, without limitation, its cellulosic biofuel facility in Nevada, Iowa) and safety and protection business and the businesses that comprise Dow s electronic materials portion of its consumer solutions business and the electronics portion of the silicones business of the Dow Corning Corporation. Dow and DuPont currently anticipate that the Business Separations will be consummated as soon as practicable  
  
    74 

     Table of Contents  

following the consummation of the Merger Transaction, likely within 18-24 months after consummation of the Merger Transaction.  
    
  In anticipation of and to facilitate the Business Separations, Dow and DuPont are planning for the internal separation of the three businesses, both domestically and internationally, through a series of transactions that are intended to be tax-efficient from both a United States and foreign perspective (collectively, the "Internal Separations"). The Internal Separations are currently expected to consist of two phases: (i) a series of internal transactions undertaken by each of Dow and DuPont to separate the three businesses underneath each of Dow and DuPont, including multiple distributions intended to qualify as tax-free spinoffs for United States tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, followed by (ii) internal distributions by Dow and DuPont, as subsidiaries of DowDuPont, to DowDuPont of entities owning two of the three businesses, which distributions are intended to qualify as tax-free spinoffs for United States tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to Dow, the Internal Separations are expected to occur in the United States and in (or involving entities domiciled in) various jurisdictions, including (but not limited to) Denmark, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and Taiwan. Following the completion of the Internal Separations, DowDuPont expects to effect the Business Separations by means of distributions to its public shareholders of the capital stock of two entities each owning one of the three businesses, in distributions intended to qualify as tax-free spinoffs for United States tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
    
  The Dow companies, or their successors, that are anticipated to be distributing corporations in the Internal Separations include the following: DC Galaxy Holding C.V.; DC Spectrum Holding C.V.; Dow Chemical Singapore Holdings Pte. Ltd.; Dow International Holdings Company; Dow International Holdings S.A.; Dow Luxembourg Spectrum Holding S.a.r.l.; Dow Switzerland Holding GmbH; Rohm and Haas Asia Holdings B.V.; Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC; Rohm and Haas Company; Rohm and Haas Denmark A/S; Rohm and Haas Denmark Finance A/S; Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials CMP, Inc.; Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials K.K.; Rohm and Haas Equity Corporation; Rohm and Haas European Holding ApS; Rohm and Haas International Holdings, Inc.; and Union Carbide Corporation.

    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent function): 
              a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
