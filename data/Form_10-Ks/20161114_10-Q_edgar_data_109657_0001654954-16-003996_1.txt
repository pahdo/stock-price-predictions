The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

OXIS International, Inc. (collectively,  OXIS  or the
 Company ) is engaged in discovering, developing
and commercializing novel therapeutics from our proprietary product
platform in a broad range of disease
areas. Currently, OXIS develops innovative drugs focused
on the treatment of cancer.  OXIS' lead drug candidate,
OXS-2175, is a small molecule therapeutic candidate targeting the
treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. 
In   in
vitro   and   in
vivo   models of TNBC,
OXS-2175 demonstrated the ability to inhibit metastasis. 
OXIS' lead drug candidate, OXS-4235, also a small molecule
therapeutic candidate, targets the treatment of multiple myeloma
and associated osteolytic lesions. 
In   in
vitro   and   in
vivo   models of
multiple myeloma, OXS-4235 demonstrated the ability to kill
multiple myeloma cells, and decrease osteolytic lesions in bone.
OXIS' lead drug candidate, OXS-1550, is a bispecific scFv
recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable
regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22
antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin as its cytotoxic
drug payload. OXS-1550 has demonstrated success in early human
clinical trials in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell
lymphoma or leukemia.  

In 1965, the corporate predecessor of OXIS, Diagnostic Data, Inc.
was incorporated in the State of California. Diagnostic Data
changed its incorporation to the State of Delaware in 1972; and
changed its name to DDI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 1985. In 1994, DDI
Pharmaceuticals merged with International BioClinical, Inc. and
Bioxytech S.A. and changed its name to OXIS International,
Inc. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP )
and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and disclosures
required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial
statements have been condensed or omitted herein. The interim
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. The unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information presented herein reflects all
normal adjustments that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The Company
is responsible for the unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements included in this report. The results of operations of
any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results
for the full year. 

Going Concern 

As
shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the
Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $121,820,000 through
 September 30,
2016 .  On a consolidated basis, the Company had
cash and cash equivalents of $154,000 at  September 30, 2016 .  The Company's plan is to raise additional capital
until such time that the Company generates sufficient revenues to
cover its cash flow needs and/or it achieves profitability.
However, the Company cannot assure that it will accomplish this
task and there are many factors that may prevent the Company from
reaching its goal of profitability.  

The
current rate of cash usage raises substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern, absent any
sources of significant cash flows.  In an effort to
mitigate this near-term concern the Company intends to seek
additional equity or debt financing to obtain sufficient funds to
sustain operations.  However, the Company cannot provide
assurance that it will successfully obtain equity or debt or other
financing, if any, sufficient to finance its goals or that the
Company will generate future product related
revenues.  The Company s financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event
that the Company cannot continue in existence.

(UNAUDITED) 

Basis of Consolidation and Comprehensive Income 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of OXIS International, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual
method of accounting. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

The Company's cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
accounts receivable are monitored for exposure to concentrations of
credit risk. The Company maintains substantially all of its cash
balances in a limited number of financial institutions. The
balances are each insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation up to $250,000. The Company does not have balances in
excess of this limit at September 30, 2016. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair value of debt is based upon current
interest rates for debt instruments with comparable maturities and
characteristics and approximates the carrying amount. 

Stock Based Compensation to Other than Employees 

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for
the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with ASC 718. Costs are measured at the estimated fair
market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair
value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
determinable. The value of equity instruments issued for
consideration other than employee services is determined on the
earlier of a performance commitment or completion of performance by
the provider of goods or services. In the case of equity
instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity
instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting
agreement. 

Impairment of Long Lived Assets 

The Company's long-lived assets currently consist of capitalized
patents. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If any of
the Company's long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the
amount of impairment to be recognized is equal to the excess of the
carrying amount of the assets over the fair value of the
assets. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
approach, whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax effects, based on current
enacted tax laws, of temporary differences between financial and
tax reporting for current and prior periods. Deferred tax assets
are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if the
corresponding future tax benefits may not be realized.

Net Income (Loss) per Share 

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share
is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus
the potential dilutive effect of common shares issuable upon
exercise or conversion of outstanding stock options and warrants
during the period. The weighted average number of potentially
dilutive common shares excluded from the calculation of net income
(loss) per share totaled  in 38,410,084 and 2,039,480 as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Patents 

Acquired patents are capitalized at their acquisition cost or fair
value. The legal costs, patent registration fees and models and
drawings required for filing patent applications are capitalized if
they relate to commercially viable technologies. Commercially
viable technologies are those technologies that are projected to
generate future positive cash flows in the near term. Legal costs
associated with patent applications that are not determined to be
commercially viable are expensed as incurred. All research and
development costs incurred in developing the patentable idea are
expensed as incurred. Legal fees from the costs incurred in
successful defense to the extent of an evident increase in the
value of the patents are capitalized. 

Capitalized cost for pending patents are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining twenty year legal life of
each patent after the costs have been incurred. Once each patent is
issued, capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the shorter of the patent's remaining statutory life,
estimated economic life or ten years. 

Fixed Assets 

Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which are 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and the
shorter of the lease term or estimated economic life for leasehold
improvements. 

Fair Value 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables
and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and
are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period
of time between the origination of such instruments and their
expected realization and their current market rate of
interest.  The three levels are defined as
follows: 

Level 1 inputs to
the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for
identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The
Company s Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, primarily
institutional money market funds, whose carrying value represents
fair value because of their short-term maturities of the
investments held by these funds. 

Level 2 inputs to
the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument. The
Company s Level 2 liabilities consist of liabilities arising
from the issuance of convertible securities and in accordance with
ASC 815-40: a warrant liability for detachable warrants, as well as
an accrued derivative liability for the beneficial conversion
feature. These liabilities are remeasured each reporting period.
Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model
based on observable market inputs, such as share price data and a
discount rate consistent with that of a government-issued security
of a similar maturity. 

Level 3 inputs to
the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the
fair value measurement.

The following table represents the Company s assets and
liabilities by level measured at fair value on a recurring basis at
September 30, 2016. 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and
reported as research and development expense. Research and
development costs totaling $725,000 and $475,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Revenue Recognition 

License Revenue 

License
arrangements may consist of non-refundable upfront license fees,
exclusive licensed rights to patented or patent pending technology,
and various performance or sales milestones and future product
royalty payments. Some of these arrangements are multiple element
arrangements. 

Non-refundable,
up-front fees that are not contingent on any future performance by
us, and require no consequential continuing involvement on our
part, are recognized as revenue when the license term commences and
the licensed data, technology and/or compound is
delivered.  We defer recognition of non-refundable
upfront fees if we have continuing performance obligations without
which the technology, right, product or service conveyed in
conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the
licensee that is separate and independent of our performance under
the other elements of the arrangement. In addition, if we have
continuing involvement through research and development services
that are required because our know-how and expertise related to the
technology is proprietary to us, or can only be performed by us,
then such up-front fees are deferred and recognized over the period
of continuing involvement. 

Payments
related to substantive, performance-based milestones in a research
and development arrangement are recognized as revenue upon the
achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying
agreements when they represent the culmination of the earnings
process. 

Use of Estimates 

The
financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's
management, which is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and
have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities revenues and expenses and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Debt 

Convertible debentures 

On
October 25, 2006, the Company entered into a securities purchase
agreement ( 2006 Purchase Agreement ) with four
accredited investors (the  2006 Purchasers ). In
conjunction with the signing of the 2006 Purchase Agreement, the
Company issued secured convertible debentures ( 2006
Debentures ) and Series A, B, C, D, and E common stock
warrants ( 2006 Warrants ) to the 2006 Purchasers, and
the parties also entered into a security agreement (the  2006
Security Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company agreed to
grant the 2006 Purchasers, pari passu, a security interest in
substantially all of the Company s assets. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the 2006 Purchase Agreement, the Company issued the
2006 Debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $1,694,250 to
the 2006 Purchasers. The 2006 Debentures are subject to an original
issue discount of 20.318% resulting in proceeds to the Company of
$1,350,000 from the transaction. The 2006 Debentures were due on
October 25, 2008. The 2006 Debentures are convertible, at the
option of the 2006 Purchasers, at any time prior to payment in
full, into shares of common stock of the Company. As a result of
the full ratchet anti-dilution provision the current conversion
price is $2.50 per share (the  2006 Conversion Price ).
Beginning on the first of the month beginning February 1, 2007, the
Company was required to amortize the 2006 Debentures in equal
installments on a monthly basis resulting in a complete repayment
by the maturity date (the  Monthly Redemption
Amounts ). The Monthly Redemption Amounts could have been
paid in cash or in shares, subject to certain restrictions. If the
Company chose to make any Monthly Redemption Amount payment in
shares of common stock, the price per share would have been the
lesser of the Conversion Price then in effect and 85% of the
weighted average price for the 10-trading days prior to the due
date of the Monthly Redemption Amount. The Company did not make any
of the required monthly redemption payments. 

Pursuant
to the provisions of the 2006 Debentures, such non-payment was an
event of default and penalty interest has accrued on the unpaid
redemption balance at an interest rate equal to the lower of 18%
per annum and the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In
addition, each of the 2006 Purchasers has the right to accelerate
the cash repayment of at least 130% of the outstanding principal
amount of the 2006 Debenture (plus accrued but unpaid liquidated
damages and interest) and to sell substantially all of the
Company s assets pursuant to the provisions of the 2006
Security Agreement to satisfy any such unpaid balance. On June 6,
2008, the Company received notification from Bristol Investment
Fund, Ltd ( Bristol ), that the collateral held under
the 2006 Security Agreement would be sold to the highest qualified
bidder on Thursday, June 19, 2008. On June 19, 2008, the Company
received a Notice of Disposition of Collateral from Bristol in
which Bristol notified the Company that Bristol, acting as the
agent for itself and the three other 2006 Purchasers, purchased
certain assets held as collateral under the 2006 Security
Agreement. Bristol purchased 111,025 shares of common stock of
BioCheck, Inc., the Company s majority owned subsidiary, on a
credit bid of $50,000, and Bristol also purchased 1,000 shares of
the capital stock of OXIS Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of OXIS, for a credit bid of $10,000. In December 2005,
OXIS purchased the 111,025 shares of common stock of BioCheck, Inc.
for $3,060,000. After crediting the aggregate amount of $60,000 to
the aggregate amount due under the 2006 Debentures, plus fees and
charges due through June 19, 2008, Bristol notified the Company
that the Company remains obligated to the 2006 Purchasers in a
deficiency in an aggregate amount of $2,688,000 as of June 19,
2008. As a result of the disposition of the collateral, the Company
recorded a net loss aggregating $2,978,000. 

Under
the 2006 Purchase Agreement, the 2006 Purchasers also have a right
of first refusal to participate in up to 100% of any future
financing undertaken by the Company until the 2006 Debentures are
no longer outstanding. In addition, the Company is also prohibited
from effecting any subsequent financing involving a variable rate
transaction until such time as no 2006 Purchaser holds any of the
2006 Debentures. Furthermore, so long as any 2006 Purchaser holds
any of the securities issued under the 2006 Purchase Agreement, if
the Company issues or sells any common stock or instruments
convertible into common stock which a 2006 Purchaser reasonably
believes is on terms more favorable to such investors than the
terms pursuant to the 2006 Debentures or 2006 Warrants, the Company
is obligated to permit such 2006 Purchaser the benefits of such
better terms.

Of the
2006 Warrants issued by the Company to the 2006 Purchasers, only
the Series A Warrants remain outstanding. The Series A Warrants,
which now expire in July 2019, permit the holders to purchase 9,681
shares of common stock at an original exercise price of $87.50 per
share. Such exercise price is adjustable pursuant to a full ratchet
anti-dilution provision and upon the occurrence of a stock split or
a related event. 

During
2009, Bristol converted $177,900 of the principal amount of 2006
Debentures for 71,160 shares of the Company s common stock.
During 2010, Bristol converted an additional $401,000 of the
principal amount of 2006 Debentures for 160,400 shares of the
Company s common stock. During 2011, an additional $605,000
of the principal amount of 2006 Debentures was converted into
242,000 shares of the Company s common stock. During 2012, an
additional $369,625 of the principal amount of 2006 Debentures was
converted into 350,619 shares of the Company s common
stock. 

The
2006 Debentures do not meet the definition of a  conventional
convertible debt instrument  since they are not convertible
into a fixed number of shares. The Monthly Redemption Amounts can
be paid with common stock at a conversion price that is a
percentage of the market price; therefore the number of shares that
could be required to be delivered upon  net-share
settlement  is essentially indeterminate. Therefore, the 2006
Debentures are considered  non-conventional,  which
means that the conversion feature must be bifurcated from the debt
and shown as a separate derivative liability. This beneficial
conversion liability has been calculated to be $690,000 on October
25, 2006. In addition, since the 2006 Debentures are convertible
into an indeterminate number of shares of common stock, it is
assumed that the Company could never have enough authorized and
unissued shares to settle the conversion of the 2006 Warrants
issues in this transaction into common stock. Therefore, the 2006
Warrants have a fair value of $2,334,000 at October 25, 2006. The
value of the 2006 Warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes
model using the following assumptions: Discount rate of 4.5%,
volatility of 158% and expected term of 1 to 6 years. The fair
value of the beneficial conversion feature and the 2006 Warrant
liability will be adjusted to fair value on each balance sheet date
with the change being shown as a component of net loss. The fair
value of the beneficial conversion feature and the 2006 Warrants at
the inception of the 2006 Debentures were $690,000 and $2,334,000,
respectively. The first $1,350,000 of these discounts was amortized
over the term of the 2006 Debenture and the excess of $1,674,000
was shown as financing costs in statement of
operations. 

The
Company and Bristol entered into a Forbearance Agreement on
December 3, 2015, pursuant to which Bristol agreed to refrain and
forbear from exercising certain rights and remedies with respect
the 2006 Debentures for three months. In exchange for the
Forbearance Agreement, the Company issued an allonge in the amount
of $250,000 increasing the principal amount if the 2006
Debentures. 

On
October 1, 2009, the Company entered into a financing arrangement
with several accredited investors (the  2009
Investors ), pursuant to which it sold various securities in
consideration of a maximum aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000
(the  2009 Financing ). In connection with the 2009
Financing, the Company issued the following securities to the 2009
Investors: 

0% Convertible
Debentures in the principal amount of $2,000,000 due 24 months from
the date of issuance (the   2009 Debentures ),
convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a
per share conversion price equal to $12.50 per share; 

Series A warrant to
purchase such number of shares of the Company s common stock
equal to 50% of the principal amount invested by each 2009 Investor
(the  2009 Class A Warrants  ) resulting in the
issuance of Class A Warrants to purchase 80,000 shares of common
stock of the Company. 

Series B warrant to
purchase such number of shares of the Company s common stock
equal to 50% of the principal amount invested by each 2009 Investor
(the  2009 Class B Warrants ) resulting in the issuance
of Class B Warrants to purchase 80,000 shares of common stock of
the Company. 

The
Class A Warrants and Class B Warrants (collectively, the  
2009 Warrants ) are exercisable for up to five years from the
date of issue at a per share exercise price equal to $15.625 and
$18.75 for the Class A Warrants and the Class B Warrants,
respectively, on a cash or cashless basis. The 2009 Debentures and
the 2009 Warrants are collectively referred to herein as the

Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms
 OXIS,    we, 
 us,    our,   the
company  and  our company  refer to OXIS
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as DDI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Diagnostic Data, Inc, together with our
subsidiaries. 

Overview 

OXIS International, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary Oxis
Biotech, Inc,   is an
immuno-oncology company with a robust technology platform
consisting of bispecific and trispecific scFv constructs,
full-length antibodies, proprietary drug payloads, proprietary
antibody-drug linkers, dual-drug payload antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs), bispecific targeted ADCs, and NK cell and T-cell antibody
directed cell-mediated cytotoxic (ADDCs)
agents.  

OXS-1550 

OXS-1550
is a bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate
composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of
anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of
diphtheria toxin as its cytotoxic drug payload.  CD19 is a
membrane glycoprotein present on the surface of all stages of
B-lymphocyte development, and is also expressed on most B-cell
mature lymphoma cells and leukemia cells.  CD22 is a
glycoprotein expressed on B-lineage lymphoid precursors, including
precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and often is co-expressed
with CD19 on mature B-cell malignancies such as
lymphoma. 

OXS-1550
targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor
or both receptors.  When OXS-1550 binds to cancer cells, the
cancer cells internalize OXS-1550, and are killed due to the action
of drug's cytotoxic diphtheria toxin payload.  OXS-1550 has
demonstrated success in a Phase 1 human clinical trial in patients
with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. 

Oxis
began enrolling patients in a Phase 1/Phase 2 trial of OXS-1550
during the second quarter of 2016. The FDA-approved clinical trial
is being conducted at the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer
Center. There are currently 32 patients who have participated in
the clinical trial. The nine new patients bring to 32 the number of
patients who have participated in the clinical trial. All the new
patients are given an approved increased dosage of
OXS-1550. 

19 

Trispecific Killer Engager (TriKE) Technology 

The TriKE platform is designed to address the issue of making NK
cells antigen specific by modifying a bispecific antibody platform
and adding a third signal by inserting a modified IL-15 cross
linker. IL-15 is known as a chief activator of NK cells that can
enhance an anti-cancer immune response. This new trispecific
platform is unique because it simultaneously delivers a priming,
expansion, killing, and activating signal directly to the immune
cell as it is in contact with the cancer cell. We are now working
currently working toward FDA approved clinical trials to
demonstrate TriKE safety and efficacy. Unlike standard anti-cancer
antibodies, we believe that TriKE can mediate specificity and
deliver an immune expansion signal locally (instead of
systemically) which has the potential to diminish
toxicity. 

OXS-4235, p62/SQSTM1 (Sequestosome-1) Inhibitor Drug Development
Program 

In humans, the p62/SQSTM1 protein is encoded by the SQSTM1
gene.  The p62/SQSTM1 protein is a multifunctional
protein involved in autophagy, cell signaling, tumorigenesis, and
plays an important role at the crossroad between autophagy and
cancer.  Cell-cell interactions between multiple myeloma
cells and bone marrow stromal cells activate signaling pathways
that result in enhanced multiple myeloma cell growth, osteoclast
formation, and inhibition of osteoblast
differentiation. 

Multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy with systematic
morbidity and a median survival of 3-5 years.  Multiple
myeloma is characterized by aberrant proliferation of terminally
differentiated plasma cells and impairment in apoptosis
capacity.  Due to the interactions between myeloma cells
and cells of the bone marrow microenvironment, the osteolytic bone
disease associated with myeloma is inextricably linked with tumor
progression.  High incidence of bone metastasis in
multiple myeloma patients is frequently associated with severe bone
pain and pathological bone fracture.  Activated
osteoclast levels and suppressed osteoblast levels are thought to
play a role in multiple myeloma associated osteolytic bone
disease. 

While a diverse spectrum of novel agents has shown therapeutic
potential for the treatment of multiple myeloma including
bortezomib, lenalidomide and arsenic trioxide, high relapse rates
and drug resistance continue to plague these
therapies.  Thus, novel targets and new therapeutics for
the treatment of multiple myeloma are of critical importance for
improved patient outcomes. 

It has been demonstrated that the ZZ domain of the p62/SQSTM1
protein is responsible for increased multiple myeloma cell growth
and associated osteoclast mediated bone disease.  Dr.
Xiang-Qun Xie and colleagues at ID4 Pharma LLC have developed novel
chemical compounds (e.g., OXS-4235) which inhibit osteoclastic bone
destruction in multiple myeloma.  Oxis Biotech has
exclusively licensed rights to OXS-4235 and other compounds for the
treatment of multiple myeloma and associated osteolytic bone
disease. 

OXS-2175, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Drug Development
Program 

OXS-2175 is a small molecule therapeutic candidate which has shown
promise in early-stage preclinical   in vitro   and   in vivo   models of triple-negative breast
cancer.  Oxis Biotech is investigating OXS-2175
formulated as an ADC therapy for the treatment of triple-negative
breast cancer.  

Therapeutic Antibody-Drug Conjugates Drug Development
Program 

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of highly potent
biopharmaceutical drugs designed as a targeted therapy for the
treatment of cancer.  By combining the unique targeting
capabilities of monoclonal antibodies with the cancer-killing
ability of cytotoxic drugs, antibody-drug conjugates allow
sensitive discrimination between healthy and diseased
tissue.

Recent Developments 

Restructuring Agreements 

Effective January 8, 2016, Company entered into agreements to
effect the restructuring (the  Restructuring ) of
certain unregistered debt and equity securities of the Company that
will result in an issuance of up to 28,389,193 shares of common
stock of the Company (the  Common
Stock ).  In connection with the Restructuring, the
Company entered into a note conversion agreement (the
 Conversion Agreement ), a warrant exercise agreement
(the  Exercise Agreement ) and a preferred stock
exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement  and,
collectively with the Conversion Agreement and the Exercise
Agreement, the  Restructuring Agreements ), pursuant to
which the Company and certain of the Company s creditors and
investors have agreed that (i) certain outstanding debt of the
Company (collectively, the  Debt ) will be converted
into shares of Common Stock; (ii) certain outstanding warrants to
purchase shares of capital stock of the Company (collectively, the
 Warrants ) will be exercised on a cashless basis for
shares of Common Stock;  and (iii) certain outstanding
shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the
 Series H Preferred Stock ) and Series I Convertible
Preferred Stock of the Company (the  Series I Preferred
Stock  and together with the Series H Preferred Stock, the
 Preferred Stock ) will be exchanged for shares of
Common Stock.  The Conversion Agreement, Exercise
Agreement and Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are described in further detail
below.   

Under the Conversion Agreement, certain creditors of the Company
holding an aggregate of approximately $15,056,000 (including
accrued interest and penalties) of outstanding Debt agreed to
convert all such outstanding Debt into shares of Common Stock at a
conversion price of $1.25 per share upon successful completion by
the Company of a $6 million financing. H owever, since the
financing did not occur by March 15, 2016, the Conversion Agreement
was terminated. 

In addition, under the Exercise Agreement, certain investors
together holding warrants to purchase 12,269,240 shares of capital
stock of the Company exchanged such warrants and received one share
of Common Stock in exchange for each share of capital stock of the
Company underlying the warrants. 

Finally, under the Exchange Agreement, certain investors together
holding 25,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock and 1,666,667
shares of Series I Preferred Stock have agreed to convert all such
shares of Preferred Stock into an aggregate of 4,075,000 shares of
Common Stock upon successful completion by the Company of a $6
million financing. 

The Restructuring Agreements terminated the warrants and any
anti-dilution protection thereunder.  In addition, all
creditor and investor parties to the Restructuring Agreements
provided a waiver of any and all past defaults and breaches under
the Warrants and Preferred Stock, in consideration of the shares
issued pursuant to the Restructuring Agreements.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

Research and Development Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred
$250,000 and $225,000 of research and development
expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred
$2,280,000 and $2,552,000 of selling, general and administrative
expenses.  The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in
professional fees, license fees investor relations and stock
compensation. 

Change in value of warrant and derivative liabilities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a gain as a
result of a decrease in the fair market value of outstanding
warrants and beneficial conversion features of
$436,000, compared to a gain of $2,809,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This reduction is a result of a
decrease in the fair market value of outstanding debt and equity
securities accounted for as derivative liabilities and the
conversion of warrants to common stock. 

Interest Expense 

Interest
expense was $1,536,000 and $1,724,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  The decrease
is primarily due to an decrease in the non-cash amortization of the
debt issuance costs associated with the convertible debentures and
demand notes payable and expenses related the issuance of
additional shares 

22 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

License revenue 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received $-0-
and $27,000 of licensing revenue related to a Vitamin D producing
line of sun care and skin care products under a license from
ESLLC. 

Research and Development Expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred
$725,000 and $475,000 of research and development
expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred
$7,827,000 and $5,571,000 of selling, general and administrative
expenses.  The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in
professional fees, license fees and stock
compensation. 

Change in value of warrant and derivative liabilities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a gain as a
result of a decrease in the fair market value of outstanding
warrants and beneficial conversion features of
$37,195,000, compared to a gain of $20,683,000 during the nine
months ended June 30, 2015. 

Interest
Expense  

Interest expense was $4,781,000 and $10,012,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  The
decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the non-cash
amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with the
convertible debentures and demand notes payable, non-cash interest
related to the beneficial conversion feature of new debt and
expenses related the issuance of additional shares 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On a consolidated basis, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$154,000 at September 30, 2016 and $16,966,000 of current
liabilities (of which $16,782,000 represented current cash
obligations and $184,000 represented non-cash warrant liabilities
and accrued expenses).  As a result, on a cash basis, as
of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of
$16,810,000.  In addition, we have an accumulated deficit
of $121,820,000 through September 30, 2016. 

In January 2016, the Company entered into convertible debentures
totaling $150,000. 

In May 2016, the Company entered into convertible debentures
totaling $1,390,044. 

In July 2016, the Company entered into convertible debentures
totaling   $112,135  .  

In August 2016, the Company entered into convertible debentures
totaling   $250,000  .  

Critical Accounting Policies 

We consider the following accounting policies to be critical given
they involve estimates and judgments made by management and are
important for our investors  understanding of our operating
results and financial condition. 

23 

Basis of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements contained in this report
include the accounts of OXIS International, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.  All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated. 

Revenue Recognition 

Product Revenue 

The Company manufactures, or has manufactured on a contract basis,
fine chemicals and nutraceutical products, which are its primary
products to be sold to customers. Revenue from the sale of its
products, including shipping fees, will be recognized when title to
the products is transferred to the customer which usually occurs
upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the sales
order and when collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from
sales to distributors of its products will be recognized, net of
allowances, upon delivery of product to the distributors. According
to the terms of individual distributor contracts, a distributor may
return product up to a maximum amount and under certain conditions
contained in its contract. Allowances are calculated based upon
historical data, current economic conditions and the underlying
contractual terms. 

License Revenue 

License arrangements may consist of non-refundable upfront license
fees and various performance or sales milestones and future product
royalty payments.  Some of these arrangements are
multiple element arrangements.  Non-refundable, up-front
fees that are not contingent on any future performance by us, and
require no consequential continuing involvement on our part, are
recognized as revenue when the license term commences and the
licensed data, technology and/or compound is
delivered.  We defer recognition of non-refundable
upfront fees if we have continuing performance obligations without
which the technology, right, product or service conveyed in
conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the
licensee that is separate and independent of our performance under
the other elements of the arrangement.  In addition, if
we have continuing involvement through research and development
services that are required because our know-how and expertise
related to the technology is proprietary to us, or can only be
performed by us, then such up-front fees are deferred and
recognized over the period of continuing involvement. 

Long-Lived Assets 

Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment,
capitalized costs of filing patent applications and goodwill and
other assets.  We evaluate our long-lived assets for
impairment in accordance with ASC 360, whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable.  Estimates of future cash flows
and timing of events for evaluating long-lived assets for
impairment are based upon management s
judgment.  If any of our intangible or long-lived assets
are considered to be impaired, the amount of impairment to be
recognized is the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over
its fair value. 

Applicable long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives, the estimated period that
the assets will generate revenue, or the statutory or contractual
term in the case of patents.  Estimates of useful lives
and periods of expected revenue generation are reviewed
periodically for appropriateness and are based upon
management s judgment.  Goodwill and other assets
are not amortized. 

Certain Expenses and Liabilities 

On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates related to
certain expenses and accrued liabilities.  We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources.  Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

24 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

During the normal course of business, from time to time, we issue
warrants as part of a debt or equity financing. We do not enter
into any derivative contracts for speculative purposes. We
recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at fair
value with changes in fair value of derivatives reflected as
current period income or loss unless the derivatives qualify for
hedge accounting and are accounted for as such. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we issued warrants to
purchase 3,475,111 and 376,000 shares of common stock,
respectively, in connection with equity transactions. In accordance
with ASC Topic 815-40,  Derivatives and Hedging  
Contracts in Entity s Own Stock  ( ASC
815-40 ), the value of these warrants is required to be
recorded as a liability, as the holders have an option to put the
warrants back to us in certain events, as defined. 

Inflation 

We believe that inflation has not had a material adverse impact on
our business or operating results during the periods
presented. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30,
2016. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk 

This company qualifies as a smaller reporting company, as defined
in 17 C.F.R.  229.10(f) (1) and is not required to provide
information by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
evaluated the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and
procedures  (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended), as of September 30, 2016.  Based on that
evaluation we have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2016. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting.  Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or
15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a
company s principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by a company s board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; 

Provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 

Provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

25 

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met.  Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within our company have been detected.  Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. 

As of September 30, 2016, management of the company conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal
control over financial reporting.  In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
Internal Control Integrated Framework.  In the
course of the assessment, material weaknesses were identified in
the company s internal control over financial
reporting. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

Management determined that fundamental elements of an effective
control environment were missing or inadequate as of September 30,
2016.  The most significant issues identified were: 1)
lack of segregation of duties due to very small staff and
significant reliance on outside consultants, and 2) risks of
executive override also due to lack of established policies, and
small employee staff.  Based on the material weaknesses
identified above, management has concluded that internal control
over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30,
2016.  As the company s operations increase, the
company intends to hire additional employees in its accounting
department. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than as described above, no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting were made during our most recent fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
