    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

A summary of the significant accounting policies
applied in the presentation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements follows: 

General  

The (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from the audited financial statements of First Choice Healthcare Solutions, Inc.
( FCHS  and including, where appropriate, its consolidated subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling
financial interest, the  Company ), and (b) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of
September 30, 2016 of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X.
To determine if we hold a controlling financial interest in an entity, we first evaluate if we are required to apply the variable
interest entity ( VIE ) model to the entity, otherwise the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. 

Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on April 14, 2016. 

Basis of Presentation  

Effective April 4, 2012, Medical Billing Assistance,
Inc., a Colorado corporation ( Medical Billing ), merged with and into the Company. The effect of the merger was that
Medical Billing reincorporated from Colorado to Delaware (the  Reincorporation ). The Company is deemed to be the successor
issuer of Medical Billing under Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). 

As a result of the Reincorporation, the Company
changed its name to First Choice Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and its shares underwent an effective four-for-one reverse split. Other
than the foregoing, the Reincorporation did not result in any change in the business, management, fiscal year, accounting, and
location of the principal executive offices, assets or liabilities of the Company. 

On April 2, 2012, the Company, through its
wholly owned subsidiary FCID Medical, Inc., completed its acquisition of First Choice Medical Group of Brevard, LLC ( First
Choice   Brevard ), pursuant to the Membership Interest Purchase Closing Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ).
The Company has been managing the practice of First Choice   Brevard since November 1, 2011, pursuant to a Management Services
Agreement. 

Brevard
Orthopaedic Spine   Pain Clinic, Inc.   

Effective
May 1, 2015, the Company, through its recently formed wholly owned subsidiary, TBC Holdings of Melbourne, Inc., entered into an
Operation and Control Agreement (the Agreement ) with Brevard Orthopaedic Spine   Pain Clinic, Inc. ( The B.A.C.K.
Center ), whereby the Company will have sole and exclusive management and control of The B.A.C.K. Center, including, but
not limited to, administrative, financial, facility and business operations, including the requirement to absorb losses or right
to receive economic benefits. The initial term of the Agreement expires on December 31, 2016 with an option by the Company to extend
the term until December 31, 2023.  

The Agreement allows the Company to hold the
current or potential rights that give it the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s
economic performance, combined with a variable interest that gives the Company the right to receive potentially significant benefits
or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses. The Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. Rights
held by others to remove the party with power over the VIE are not considered unless one party can exercise those rights unilaterally.
When changes occur to the structure of the entity, the Company will reconsider whether it is subject to the VIE model. The Company
continuously evaluates whether it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE.

Crane
Creek Surgery Center   

Effective
October 1, 2015, the Company, through its recently formed wholly owned subsidiary, CCSC Holdings, Inc., acquired  a 40% interest
in Crane Creek Surgery Center ( Crane Creek ) in exchange for an investment of $560,000 comprised of $140,000 cash
and a promissory note for $420,000, which bears 8% interest per annum, matures April 15, 2016 and was personally guaranteed by
the Company s Chief Executive Officer. This note was paid in full on April 15, 2016. In connection with the investment, the
Company is entitled to 51% voting rights for all decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of Crane Creek.
The 40% equity interest acquired entitles the Company to 40% of the profit or loss of Crank Creek. 

The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
FCID Holdings, Inc.; MTMC of Melbourne, Inc.; Marina Towers, LLC; FCID Medical Inc.; TBC Holdings of Melbourne, Inc.; First Choice
  Brevard; Surgical Partners of Melbourne, Inc. and CCSC Holdings, Inc., along with The B.A.C.K. Center and Crane Creek,
our variable interest entities ( VIE ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions, including those involving
the VIE, have been eliminated in consolidation.  

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Use of estimates  

The preparation of the financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain
reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include
the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the Company s stock, and stock-based compensation.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Revenue recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10,   Revenue Recognition   ( ASC 605-10 ), which
requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination
of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products
delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances,
and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

ASC 605-10 incorporates Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 605-25,   Multiple-Element Arrangements   ( ASC 605-25 ). ASC 605-25 addresses
accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.
The effect of implementing ASC 605-25 on the Company s financial position and results of operations was not significant. 

The Company recognizes in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification subtopic 954-310,  Health Care Entities  ( ASC 954-310 ), significant patient service
revenue at the time the services are rendered, even though it does not assess the patient s ability to pay. Therefore, The
Company s interim and annual periods reports disclose both, its policy for assessing and disclosing the timing and amount
of uncollectable patient service revenue recognized as doubtful. Qualitative and quantitative information about significant changes
in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to patient accounts receivable are disclosed in the Company s reports. These
estimates are based upon the history and identified trends for each of our payers.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

Patient service revenue  

The Company recognizes patient service revenue
associated with services provided to patients who have third-party  payer coverage on the basis
of contractual rates for the services provided. For uninsured or self-pay patients that do not qualify for charity care, the Company
recognizes revenue on the basis of its standard rates for services provided (or on the basis of discounted rates, if negotiated
or provided by policy). On the basis of historical experience, a portion of the Company s patient service revenue may
be potentially uncollectible due to patients who are unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided or the portion of their
bill for which they are responsible. Thus, the Company records a provision for bad debts related to potentially uncollectible patient
service revenue in the period the services are provided.  

Rental revenue  

FCID Holdings had one real estate holding,
Marina Towers, a Class A 78,000 square foot, six-story building located on the Indian River in Melbourne, Florida. The address
is 709 South Harbor City Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32901. In addition to housing our corporate headquarters and First Choice
Medical Group, the building, which averages 95% annual occupancy, also leases commercial office space to tenants. Our corporate
headquarters currently utilize 2,521 square feet on the fifth floor of Marina Towers; and First Choice Medical Group, including
its MRI center and Physical Therapy center, currently occupies 26,838 square feet on the ground, first and second floors. Until
March 2016, Marina Towers was owned by Marina Towers, LLC, a subsidiary owned by FCID Holdings (99%) and MTMC of Melbourne, Inc.
(1%), both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. In September 2016, both FCID Holdings and MTMC of Melbourne were dissolved. 

On March
31, 2016, we completed the sale of Marina Towers to Global Medical REIT Inc. for a purchase price of $15.45 million. In addition,
our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Towers, LLC, leased back the entire facility via a 10-year absolute triple-net master lease
agreement that will expire in 2026 and be renewable for two five-year periods on the same terms and conditions as the primary lease
term with the exception of rent, which will be adjusted to the prevailing market rent at renewal and will escalate in successive
years during the extended lease period.  

Until Marina Towers  sale on March 31,
2016, the Company recognized rental revenue associated with the period the facility is leased at the contractual lease rates (or
on the basis of discounted rates, if negotiated). 

In addition, beginning May 1, 2015, TBC Holdings
of Melbourne, Inc., through The B.A.C.K. Center, subleases approximately 34,480 square feet of commercial office space to third
party tenants at 2222 South Harbor City Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32901, which is also The B.A.C.K. Center s main medical
practice location. 

Cash  

Cash consists of cash held in bank demand deposits. The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had $6,591,035 cash, of which $1,445,090 held by VIE. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had
$1,594,998 cash, of which $1,556,303 held by VIE. 

Concentrations of credit risk  

The Company s financial instruments that
are exposed to a concentration of credit risk are cash and accounts receivable. Occasionally, the Company s cash and cash
equivalents in interest-bearing accounts may exceed FDIC insurance limits. The financial stability of these institutions is periodically
reviewed by senior management. 

Accounts receivables  

Accounts receivables are carried at their estimated
collectible amounts net of doubtful accounts. The Company analyzes its history and identifies trends for each major payer sources
of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. Management regularly reviews
data about these major payer sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

Rental receivables. Accounts receivables from rental activities are periodically evaluated for collectability in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful account and provision of bad debts.   

Patient receivables. Accounts receivables from services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Company analyzes contractually due amounts and provides a provision for bad debts, if necessary. The Company records a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of past experience or when indications are the patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted, is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.   

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company s provision for bad debts was $3,628,003 and $2,498,398, respectively. 

Segment information  

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic
  Segment Reporting   280-10 ( ASC 280-10 ) establishes standards for reporting information regarding
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim
financial reports issued to stockholders. ASC 280-10 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services
and geographic areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial
information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how
to allocate resources and assess performance. The information disclosed herein represents all of the material financial information
related to the Company s principal operating segments (see Note 15   Segment Reporting). 

Patents  

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized
over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually.
The Company s intangible assets with finite lives are patent costs, which are amortized over their economic or legal life,
whichever is shorter. These patent costs were acquired on September 7, 2013 by the issuance of 636,666 shares of the Company s
common stock to a related party. The shares of common stock were valued at $286,500, which was estimated to be approximately the
fair value of the patent acquired and did not materially differ from the fair value of the common stock. The amortization for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,775 and $14,325, respectively; and for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015 was $4,775 and $14,325, respectively. Accumulated amortization of Patent costs were $52,525 and $38,200 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Patient list  

Patient list is comprised of acquired patients
in connection with the acquisition of First Choice - Brevard and is amortized ratably over the estimated useful life of 15 years.
The amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,000 and $15,000, respectively; and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $5,000 and $15,000, respectively. Accumulated amortization of patient list costs was
$90,000 and $75,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Net
income per share   

The Company
computes basic net income per share by dividing net income per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per
share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities
into common stock using the  treasury stock  and/or  if converted  methods as applicable. The computation
of basic and diluted income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes potentially dilutive
securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price
of the common stock during the period.

FIRST CHOICE HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS, INC.  

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

Potentially
dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net income per share are as follows:   

Dilutive securities are comprised of 3,333,333
shares from convertible debt in the computation of net income per common share, diluted. 

Stock-based compensation  

The Company measures the cost of services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value
of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting
dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over
the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based
compensation expense is recorded by the Company in the same expense classifications in the consolidated statements of operations,
as if such amounts were paid in cash. 

Deferred costs  

On May 1, 2015, in connection with the Operation
and Control Agreement with Brevard Orthopaedic Spine   Pain Clinic, Inc. ( The B.A.C.K. Center ), the Company
reserved 3,000,000 options to purchase the Company s common stock at $1.35 per share, expiring on December 31, 2023 and
vesting is contingent on The B.A.C.K. Center employees executing employment agreements with TBC Holding and the acquisition of
the variable interest entity. The determined fair value of $3,226,427, determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions: Dividend yield: 0%; Volatility: 134.09% and Risk free rate: 2.12%, is amortized ratably to operations
over an estimated 8.67-year life. The amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $80,661 and $241,983;
and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $80,661 and $134,435, respectively. Accumulated amortization
of the deferred costs was $457,079 and $215,096 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Investments  

The Company has adopted Accounting Standards
Codification subtopic 323-10, Investments-Equity Methods and Joint Ventures ( ASC 323-10), which requires the accounting
for investments where the Company can exert significant influence, but not control of a joint venture or equity investment. The
Company owned a 0.6660% interest in a non-consolidated affiliate, Doctor s Surgical Partnership, LTD. In accordance with
the equity method of accounting, investments in non-consolidated affiliates are carried at cost and adjusted for the Company s
proportionate share of their undistributed earnings or losses. 

Income taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant
to Accounting Standards Codified 740 ( ASC 740 ). Under ASC 740 deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities
are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments.
ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.   

To the extent that valuation is based on models
or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain
cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure
purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The carrying value of the Company s cash,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including lines of credit and notes payable), and other current assets
and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company did not have any items that would be classified as level 1, 2 or 3 disclosures. 

Recent accounting pronouncements  

There are other updates recently issued, most
of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected
to a have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Subsequent events  

The Company evaluates events that have occurred
after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Based upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify
any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial
statements, except as disclosed. 

NOTE 3   LIQUIDITY  

The Company incurred various non-recurring
expenses in 2015 in connection with the planned development of its Healthcare Services Business. Management believes continued
growth of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2016 will support improved liquidity. 

In 2015, the Company converted to equity a
total of $2,892,314 in outstanding debt, advances and accrued interest. Currently, the Company has five main sources of
liquidity, its cash on hand, line of credit with CT Capital, LP; patient service revenue received from FCID Medical, Inc.,
TBC Holdings of Melbourne, Inc. and CCSC Holdings, Inc.; and rental revenue received from its real estate interests, FCID Holdings,
Inc. and TBC Holdings of Melbourne, Inc.

On June
13, 2013, the Company s subsidiary, First Choice   Brevard entered into a loan and security agreement with CT Capital,
Ltd., d/b/a CT Capital, LP, a Florida limited liability partnership for an accounts receivable line of credit in the maximum aggregate
amount of $1,500,000. Under the line of credit with CT Capital, the Company reduced the annual interest rate from 12% per annum
to 6% per annum in exchange for the issuance to CT Capital of 100,000 restricted shares of the Company s common stock. On
June 9, 2015, First Choice   Brevard entered into a modification agreement amending the loan and security agreement, increasing
the maximum aggregate amount available from $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 and on December 14, 2015, increasing the maximum aggregate
available from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000 and extending the maturity date to July 30, 2017 in exchange for 100,000 restricted shares
of the Company s common stock. The $500,000 increase may be repaid at any time, and is not subject to the conversion provision
set forth in the loan agreement. All other terms and conditions of the loan agreement remain in full force and effect. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had used $2,500,000 of the amount available under the line of credit. (See Note 6   Lines of Credit).  

Up until March 31, 2016, FCID Holdings had
one real estate holding, Marina Towers, a Class A 78,000 square foot, six-story building located on the Indian River in Melbourne,
Florida. The address is 709 South Harbor City Boulevard, Melbourne, Florida 32901. In addition to housing our corporate headquarters
and First Choice Medical Group, the building, which is now 100% occupied, also leases commercial office space to
tenants. Our corporate headquarters currently utilizes 2,521 square feet on the fifth floor of Marina Towers; and First Choice
Medical Group, including its MRI center and Physical Therapy center, currently occupies 26,838 square feet on the ground, first
and second floors. Until March 2016, Marina Towers was owned by Marina Towers, LLC, a subsidiary owned by FCID Holdings (99%)
and MTMC of Melbourne, Inc. (1%), both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. In September 2016, both FCID Holdings and
MTMC of Melbourne were dissolved. 

On March 31, 2016, we completed the sale of
Marina Towers to Global Medical REIT Inc. for a purchase price of $15.45 million. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina
Towers, LLC, leased back the entire facility via a 10-year absolute triple-net master lease agreement that will expire in 2026
and be renewable for two five-year periods on the same terms and conditions as the primary lease term with the exception of rent,
which will be adjusted to the prevailing market rent at renewal and will escalate in successive years during the extended lease
period. Until Marina Towers  sale on March 31, 2016, the Company recognized rental revenue associated with the period the
facility is leased at the contractual lease rates (or on the basis of discounted rates, if negotiated). 

In addition, beginning May 1, 2015, TBC Holdings
of Melbourne, Inc., through The B.A.C.K. Center, subleases 31,835 square feet of commercial office space to third party tenants
as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company
believes that the current positive cash balance, along with continued execution of its business development plan and the sale and
leaseback of Marina Towers, will allow the Company to further improve its working capital; and currently anticipates that it will
have sufficient capital resources to meet projected cash flow requirements through the date that is one year and one day from the
filing of this report.   

However,
in order to execute the Company s business development plan, which there can be no assurance we will achieve, the Company
may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other
means and potentially reduce operating expenditures. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required
to curtail its business development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve its cash.

and the Company s decision-making role, if any, in those activities that significantly determine the entity s economic
performance as compared to other economic interest holders .

Crane
Creek Surgery Center   

Effective
October 1, 2015, the Company, through its then newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, CCSC Holdings, Inc., acquired  a 40%
interest in Crane Creek Surgery Center ( Crane Creek ) in exchange for an investment of $560,000 comprised of $140,000
cash and a promissory note for $420,000 which bore 8% interest per annum, matures April 15, 2016 and was personally guaranteed
by the Company s Chief Executive Officer.  The promissory note was paid in full on April
15, 2016.  

In connection with the investment, the Company
is entitled to 51% voting rights for all decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of Crane Creek. The
40% equity interest acquired entitles the Company to 40% of the profit or loss of Crank Creek. 

The Company has determined that Crane Creek
is a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ) in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810,   Consolidation .  In evaluating whether the
Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, the Company considers
the purpose for which the VIE was created, the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and the Company s
decision-making role, if any, in those activities that significantly determine the entity s economic performance as compared
to other economic interest holders. 

This evaluation requires consideration of all
facts and circumstances relevant to decision-making that affects the entity s future performance and the exercise of professional
judgment in deciding which decision-making rights are most important. 

In determining whether the Company has the
right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company evaluates

NOTE 15   SEGMENT REPORTING  

The Company reports segment information based
on the  management  approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company s reportable segments. The Company has three reportable
segments: FCID Medical, Inc., The B.A.C.K. Center and CCSC Holdings, Inc. 

All reportable
segments derive revenue for medical services provided to patients; and The B.A.C.K Center additionally derives revenue for subleasing
space within its building and medical services provided to patients. With the aforementioned sale and leaseback of Marina Towers
on March 31, 2016, the Company will no longer report segmented rental revenue received from third party Marina Tower tenants under
the segment heading  Marina Towers.  Rather, the Company has consolidated rental revenue received from third party
tenants of Marina Towers under the  Corporate  segment for both the 2016 and 2015 comparable reporting periods; and
will continue to do so hereafter.  

Information concerning the operations of the
Company s reportable segments is as follows:

Litigation   Health First Management

The B.A.C.K.
Center has a claim filed in Brevard County, Florida Circuit Court against Health First Management, Inc. due to a contract dispute.
A counterclaim was filed against the Company. The case has been litigated for a substantial amount of time and a trial is anticipated
to take place within the next 12 months. The Company has vigorously defended against the counterclaim. The Company has accrued
a possible loss contingency of approximately $118,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, there
has been no change to the status of the litigation.  

From time to time, we may become involved in
various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

Operating leases  

The B.A.C.K. Center leases office space under
various non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through June 2026. Terms of the lease agreements provide for
rental payments ranging from approximately $4,200 to $200,000 per month. Certain leases include charges for sales and real estate
taxes and a proration of common area maintenance expenses. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), all rental payments,
including fixed rent increases, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. The GAAP-based rent expense
and the actual lease payments are reflected as deferred rent on the accompanying balance sheet. From the date of the Operation
and Control Agreement through December 31, 2015, lease expense amounted to $2,360,986. 

The following is a schedule of future minimum
lease payments for all non-cancelable operating leases for each of the next five years ending December 31 and thereafter: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
The B.A.C.K. Center collected $1,070,139 in net rental revenue from third party tenants.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

Sale/Leaseback  

Effective March 31, 2016, the Company leased
Marina Towers under a sale/leaseback transaction (See Note 4), via a 10-year absolute triple-net master lease agreement that expires
in 2026. The Company has two successive options to renew the lease for five-year periods on the same terms and conditions as the
primary non-revocable lease term with the exception of rent, which will be adjusted to the prevailing fair market rent at renewal
and will escalate in successive years during the extended lease period. The Company does not have any residual interest nor the
option to repurchase the facility at the end of the lease term. 

The following is a schedule of future minimum
lease payments for the non-cancelable operating lease for each of the next five years ending December 31 and thereafter: 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company collected $772,289 in net rental revenue from third party tenants
of Marina Towers . 

Guarantees  

The B.A.C.K. Center s shareholders and
a related party have guaranteed the full and prompt payment of the base rent, the additional rent and any all other sums and charges
payable by a tenant, its successors and assigns under the lease, and the full performance and observance of all the covenants,
terms, conditions and agreements for one of the above mentioned operating leases. 

NOTE 17   INCOME TAXES  

In the first quarter of 2016, effective March
31, 2016, we sold and leased back Marina Towers under a sale/leaseback transaction (See  Gain on Sale of Property and Improvements ).
In connection with the sale, the Company reported a gain on sale of the property of $9,188,968 (GAAP Basis) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. There was a Tax Basis gain of approximate $9,051,430. The difference between the GAPP Basis and Tax Basis
gain was mainly attributable to depreciation. The gain was offset by Net Operation Losses the Company has generated in prior periods,
so no income tax was recorded, but an estimated Alternative Minimum Tax liability of $181,089 was recorded. Offsetting the Alternative
Minimum tax recorded is a Deferred Tax Asset of the same amount related to the Alternative Minimum Tax Liability (Alternative Minimum
Tax Credit Carryforward). Management believes the Company will utilize the Alternative Minimum Tax Carryforward in future periods,
as of the September 30, 2016 reporting period. 

The Company s effective tax rate in the
second quarter of 2016 is approximately 38.6% See Note 20,  Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional information. 

NOTE 18   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In November 2016, the Company issued 180,000

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

This

Act of 1933, as amended ( Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange
Act ). Forward-looking statements reflect the current view about future events. When used in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   future, 
 intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management,
identify forward-looking statements. Such statements, include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q relating to our business strategy, our future operating results, and our liquidity and capital resources outlook.
Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other
future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks
and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by
the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance.
We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the execution of our strategy
to grow our business by hiring additional physicians to create Medical Centers of Excellence that fit our defined criteria; evolving
healthcare laws and regulations; changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements for medical services; accelerated
pace of consolidation in the hospital industry; changes in our medical technology as it relates to our services and procedures;
any failures in our information technology systems to protect the privacy and security of protected information and other similar
cyber security risks; our ability to raise capital to fund continuing operations; and other factors relating to our industry, our
operations and results of operations and any new Medical Centers of Excellence that we may open. Should one or more of these risks
or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from
those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.  

Factors or events that
could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We
cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including
the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results. 

Overview  

First Choice Healthcare
Solutions, Inc. ( FCHS,   the Company,   we,   our  or  us ) is implementing
the second phase of a defined growth strategy aimed at building a network of localized, integrated healthcare delivery platforms
in key expansion markets throughout the Southeastern U.S. Our flagship platform in Melbourne, Florida is comprised of non-physician-owned
medical centers of excellence, which concentrate on treating patients in the following specialties: Orthopaedics, Spine Surgery,
Neurology and Interventional Pain Management; and provide a robust offering of related diagnostic and ancillary services  
all centrally located in a geographic region. 

Successful
implementation of our first phase allowed us to confirm that by integrating the synergistic mix of Orthopaedic, Spine Surgery,
Neurology and Interventional Pain specialties with related diagnostic and ancillary services and state-of-the-art equipment and
technologies across legacy brick-and-mortar boundaries, we are able to effectively:  

provide patients with direct and convenient access to musculoskeletal and rehabilitative care via our best-in-class team of surgeons, physicians and care specialists, and wide array of ancillary and diagnostic services, which includes, but is not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ), X-ray ( X-ray ), durable medical equipment ( DME ) and rehabilitative care, including physical therapy ( PT ) and occupational therapy ( OT ).   

empower physicians to collaborate as a unified care team, optimizing care coordination and improving patient outcomes;    

advance the quality and cost effectiveness of our patients  healthcare, thereby achieving faster recoveries at materially reduced cost to payors; and   

achieve strong, sustainable financial performance that serves to create long-term value for our stockholders.   

28  

Our goal is to build
a network of non-physician-owned and operated Medical Centers of Excellence in diverse locations, primarily throughout the southeastern
region of the United States. By centralizing current and future Centers  business management functions, including call center
operations, scheduling, billing, compliance, accounting, marketing, advertising, legal, information technology and record-keeping,
at our corporate headquarters, we will maintain efficiencies and achieve scales of economies. We believe our structure will enable
our staff physicians to focus on the practice of medicine and the delivery of quality care to the patients we serve, as opposed
to having their time and attention focused on business administration responsibilities. We currently have 151 employees, including
13 doctors and eight physician assistants. 

Our Healthcare Services Business  

Presently,
we own and operate First Choice Medical Group of Brevard, LLC ( First Choice   Brevard,  First Choice Medical
Group  or  FCMG ), our multi-specialty Medical Center of Excellence located in Melbourne, Florida. First Choice
  Brevard specializes in the delivery of musculoskeletal medicine, via our strategically aligned sub-specialties in Orthopaedics,
Neurology and Interventional Pain medicine, coupled with on-site diagnostic and ancillary services, including MRI, X-ray, DME,
PT and OT with multiple quality-focused goals centered on enriching our patients  care experiences.  

On May 1, 2015, through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, TBC Holdings of Melbourne, Inc., we entered into an Operation and Control Agreement (the  Agreement )
with Brevard Orthopaedic Spine   Pain Clinic, Inc. ( The B.A.C.K. Center ), a premier Spine, Orthopaedic and Pain
practice in Brevard County, Florida. The B.A.C.K. Center operates two medical offices located in Melbourne and Merritt Island,
Florida.  

On October 1, 2015, through
our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, CCSC Holdings, Inc., we acquired a 40% interest in 
Melbourne, Florida-based Crane Creek Surgery Center ( Crane Creek ). Established in 2009, Crane Creek is an AAAHC accredited
facility dedicated to delivering excellent, ambulatory surgical care in a convenient, comfortable outpatient environment. The modern
18,000+ square foot facility is located in Melbourne, Florida within the Crane Creek Medical Center building, which is also home
to Osler Medical and The B.A.C.K. Center. Crane Creek s facility houses four state-of-the-art operating rooms and a procedure
room; with capacity and capability to host 4,000-5,000 Orthopaedic, Spine, Interventional Pain and general surgical procedures
each year.  The other owners of Crane Creek are CCSC TBC Group, LLC ( TBC Group ), owned by Richard Hynes, M.D.,
FASC and Devin Datta, M.D.; and Blue Chip Surgical Center Partners, which develops and manages 17 world class ambulatory surgery
centers across the United States . Dr. Hynes and Dr. Datta are both affiliated with The B.A.C.K. Center. Together, CCSC Holdings
and TBC Group own 75% interest in Crane Creek. In accordance with the Crane Creek Restated and Amended Operating Agreement, CCSC
Holdings will exercise sufficient control over the business of Crane Creek that will allow First Choice to treat it as a variable
interest entity, effective October 1, 2015. As a result, First Choice will include the financial results of Crane Creek in its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as if it were a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Dr. Hynes   has been appointed as President of Crane Creek s Medical Board and as Medical Director. 

Our Real Estate Business  

Up until its dissolution
effective September 30, 2016, FCID Holdings, Inc. ( FCID Holdings ) was our wholly owned subsidiary, which operated
our real estate interests. Up until its sale in March 2016, FCID Holdings had one real estate holding, Marina Towers, LLC, a 78,000
square foot, Class A, six-story building located on the Indian River in Melbourne, Florida. In addition to housing our corporate
headquarters and FCMG, the building, which is now 100% occupied, also leases approximately 48,698 square feet of commercial
office space to third party tenants. In addition, beginning May 1, 2015, TBC Holdings of Melbourne, Inc., through The B.A.C.K.
Center, subleases approximately 34,480 square feet of commercial office space to third party tenants. 

On
March 31, 2016, we completed the sale of Marina Towers to Global Medical REIT Inc. for a purchase price of $15.45 million. In addition,
our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Towers, LLC, leased back the entire facility via a 10-year absolute triple-net master lease
agreement that will expire in 2026 and be renewable for two five-year periods on the same terms and conditions as the primary lease
term with the exception of rent, which will be adjusted to the prevailing market rent at renewal and will escalate in successive
years during the extended lease period.  

29  

New Accounting Pronouncements  

There are various updates
recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries
and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues  

Total revenues increased
22% to $7,669,743 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to revenues of $6,292,122 for the same period
in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to the addition on May 1, 2015 of Brevard Orthopaedic Spine   Pain
Clinic, Inc. ( The B.A.C.K. Center ) and on October 1, 2015 of Crane Creek Surgical Center ( Crane Creek ),
which contributed revenues of $3,367,244 and $1,125,839, respectively, for the quarter ended comprised of additional patient services
revenue of $4,143,395 and rental revenue of $349,688. Patient services revenue generated by First Choice Medical Group ( FCMG )
increased by $1,170,422, or 66%, after factoring provision for doubtful accounts. Rental revenue increased by $69,842,
totaling $585,978 and $516,136 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the
addition of rental revenue from The B.A.C.K. Center. 

The provision for doubtful
accounts during the second quarter of 2016 totaled $319,319. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-07 in 2014, which requires that
healthcare entities change the presentation of the statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for doubtful accounts
from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenues. All periods presented have been reclassified in accordance
with ASU 2011-07. 

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses include
the following: 

The major components of
operating expenses include practice salaries and benefits, practice supplies and other operating costs, depreciation and general
and administrative expenses, which included legal, accounting and professional fees associated with being a public entity. 

Salaries and benefits increased
41% to $3,158,172 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,240,109 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The increase was primarily due to the addition on May 1, 2015 of The B.A.C.K. Center and October 1, 2015 of Crane Creek,
which represented an additional $310,338 in the reporting period. The existing segments netted an increase of $607,725 as compared
to 2015. Other operating expenses increased 110% to $1,405,489 from $670,923 due to the increase in patient service volume from
2015 to 2016 with the added facilities. 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 8% to $2,404,996, up from $2,234,647. The
change was largely attributable to adding The B.A.C.K. Center and Crane Creek. We believe that each additional sale or service
and corresponding gross profit of such sale or service has minimal incremental offsetting operating expenses. Thus, additional
sales could contribute to profit at a higher rate of return on sales as a result of not needing to expand operating expenses at
the same pace as sales.  

30  

Depreciation and
amortization decreased 28% from $273,263 reported for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $195,821 reported for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the sale/leaseback of our office building net with an increase
from our two additional operating segments. 

Net Income from Operations   

The income from operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 42% to $505,265, which compared to $873,180 for the same
period in the prior year. 

Interest Expense   

Interest
expense decreased 72% to $56,560 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which compared to $202,907 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease primarily is due to payoff of our Marina Towers mortgage and conversions of our convertible
notes payable to Hillair Capital Investments, LP in 2015 as compared to the same period last year.  

Net Income    

As a result of all the
above, we reported net income of $544,940 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a 14% decrease
in net income from $631,281 reported for the same three-month period in the prior year. 

Segment Results   

The
Company reports segment information based on the  management  approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company s reportable segments . 

The following are the revenues,
operating expenses and net loss by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

With the aforementioned
sale and leaseback of Marina Towers on March 31, 2016, the Company will no longer report segmented rental revenue received from
third party Marina Tower tenants under the segment heading  Marina Towers.  Rather, the Company has consolidated rental
revenue received from third party tenants of Marina Towers under the  Corporate  segment for both the 2016 and 2015
comparable reporting periods; and will continue to do so hereafter. The significant fluctuations in the line items are described
above.

Revenues  

Total revenues increased
72% to $22,564,596 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to revenues of $13,121,604 for the same period
in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to the addition on May 1, 2015 of Brevard Orthopaedic Spine   Pain
Clinic, Inc. ( The B.A.C.K. Center ) and on October 1, 2015 of Crane Creek Surgical Center ( Crane Creek), which
contributed revenues of $10,322,402 and $3,843,200, respectively, for the nine months comprised of additional patient services
revenue of $13,095,463 and rental revenue of $1,070,139. Patient services revenue generated by First Choice Medical Group
( FCMG ) increased by $1,743,474 or 30%, after factoring provision for doubtful accounts. Rental revenue
increased by $540,913, totaling $1,842,428 and $1,301,515 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
primarily due to the addition of rental revenue from The B.A.C.K. Center. 

The provision for doubtful
accounts during the first nine months of 2016 totaled $849,037. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-07 in 2014, which requires
that healthcare entities change the presentation of the statement of operations by reclassifying the provision for doubtful accounts
from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenues. All periods presented have been reclassified in accordance
with ASU 2011-07. 

Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses include
the following: 

The major components of
operating expenses include practice salaries and benefits, practice supplies and other operating costs, depreciation and general
and administrative expenses, which included legal, accounting and professional fees associated with being a public entity. 

Salaries and benefits increased
71% to $9,077,783 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5,311,710 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The increase was primarily due to the addition on May 1, 2015 of The B.A.C.K. Center and October 1, 2015 of Crane Creek,
which represented an additional $3,405,374 in the reporting period. The existing segments netted an increase of $360,699 as compared
to 2015. Other operating expenses increased 147% to $4,166,139 from $1,685,830 due to the increase in patient service volume from
2015 to 2016 with the added facilities. 

32  

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 66% to $7,346,614, up from $4,437,801. The
increase was largely attributable adding The B.A.C.K. Center and Crane Creek, adding $2,795,309 in costs. We believe that
each additional sale or service and corresponding gross profit of such sale or service has minimal incremental offsetting operating
expenses. Thus, additional sales could contribute to profit at a higher rate of return on sales as a result of not needing to
expand operating expenses at the same pace as sales.  

Depreciation and amortization
increased 13% from $558,189 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $631,571 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
The increase is primarily due to the addition of The B.A.C.K. Center and Crane Creek segments. 

Net Income from Operations   

The income from operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 19% to $1,342,489, which compared to income from operations
of $1,128,074 for the same period in the prior year. 

Gain on Sale of Property and Improvements   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold equipment for a net gain of $23,378 as compared to $-0- for the same period last
year.  

Effective
March 31, 2016, we sold and leased back Marina Towers under a sale/leaseback transaction  via a 10-year absolute triple-net
master lease agreement that expires in 2026. The Company has two successive options to renew the lease for five-year periods on
the same terms and conditions as the primary non-revocable lease term with the exception of rent, which will be adjusted to the
prevailing fair market rent at renewal and will escalate in successive years during the extended lease period. In connection with
the sale, we reported a gain on sale of property of $9,188,968 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest Expense   

Interest expense decreased
69% to $288,748 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which compared to $925,045 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease primarily is due to payoff of our Marina Towers mortgage and conversions of our convertible notes payable with
Hillair Capital Investments, LP in 2015 as compared to the same period last year. 

Net Income (Loss)   

As a result of all the
above, we reported net income of $10,265,018 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing a significant improvement
over net income of $165,241 reported for the same three-month period in the prior year. 

Segment Results   

The
Company reports segment information based on the  management  approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company s reportable segments . 

The following are the revenues,

For the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016  

For the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2015  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $6,591,035 and accounts receivables totaling $9,477,069. This compared to cash of
$1,594,998, restricted cash of $359,414 and accounts receivable of $6,623,894 as of the end of 2015.  

The Marina Towers building
is 100% occupied. We believe that our current positive cash balance, along with continued execution of our Company s
business development plan, will allow us to further improve our working capital; and that we will have sufficient capital resources
to meet projected cash flow requirements through the date that is one year plus a day from the filing date of this report. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in fully executing our business development plan. 

Net
cash used in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $2,251,710, which compared to net cash
provided by our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $579,539. The increase in cash used was due primarily
to increases in our operating assets of $3,562,484 and decreases in our operating liabilities of $1,535,810 as compared to $1,571,952
and $(178,329) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our net income of $10,470,668 for the current period as compared to
net income of $165,241 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, with payment of the non-cash loan extension of $92,000, bad
debt expense of $849,037 and depreciation and amortization of $647,225, net with the gain on the sale of property of $9,212,346
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This compared to a $1,807,921 aggregate change for the same period last year.  

Net cash flows provided
by investing activities was $14,874,079 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $445,712 provided by investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016, we received $15,068,497 net proceeds from the sale of Marina
Towers and $45,000 for the sale of equipment. In 2015, we incorporated $679,673 cash from a variable interest entity. Purchases
of equipment were $239,418 and $92,609 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to less cash spent
on the purchase of equipment in 2015 compared to the current year. 

34  

Cash flows used in financing
activities was $7,626,332 for nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $552,779
or the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were the result of: 

On March 31, 2016, in connection
with the sale/leaseback transaction of Marina Towers, we paid off the outstanding mortgage balance due of $7,223,771. 

Currently, we are actively
engaged in identifying and pursuing discussions with prospective acquisitions and/or implementation of operation and management
agreements that qualify as variable interest entities in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in key target
markets   with those being largely in the southeastern U.S. Over the next 12 months, we expect to incur significant capital
costs to further develop and expand our medical operations. We plan to continue expanding our platform We expect to need additional
capital of approximately $4-6 million to fund the development and expansion of our operations over the next 12 months. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms for, or find suitable candidates for, such acquisition. 

There
can be no assurance that our cash flow will increase in the near future from anticipated new business activities, or that revenues
generated from our existing operations will be sufficient to allow us to continue to pursue new customer programs or profitable
ventures.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We currently have no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

There were various updated
recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries
and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management does not believe
that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the
accompanying financial statements. 

Inflation  

The effect of inflation
on our revenue and operating results was not significant. 

Climate Change  

We believe that neither
climate change, nor government regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on
our operations.  

35  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk  

As a smaller reporting
company, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information required
by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective   to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

The
B.A.C.K. Center has a claim filed in Brevard County, Florida Circuit Court against Health First Management, Inc. due to a contract
dispute. A counterclaim was filed against the Company. The case has been litigated for a substantial amount of time and a trial
is anticipated to take place within the next 12 months. The Company has vigorously defended against the counterclaim. The Company
has accrued a possible loss contingency of approximately $118,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September 30,
2016, there has been no change to the status of the litigation.  

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our
business.

changes to the Risk Factors reported in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
