1.    Basis of Accounting Presentation 
  CPG OpCo GP LLC ("OpCo GP") is a subsidiary of CPG formed in Delaware on December 5, 2007. Through the registration of CPG's senior notes, OpCo GP, as a guarantor of the notes, must comply with the reporting requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. OpCo GP has not had any assets, liabilities, operations or cash flows since its formation date. 
  The formation transactions that occurred as part of the initial public offering of CPPL resulted in OpCo GP becoming the general partner of Columbia OpCo. Columbia OpCo owns substantially all of CPG's natural gas transmission and storage assets. CPPL owns a     15.7%     limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo. The remaining     84.3%     limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo is owned by CEG,   a   100%   owned sub  sidiary of CPG. 
  Consolidation of Columbia OpCo 
  Under ASC 810, Columbia OpCo is determined to be a VIE. Additionally, it is determined that OpCo GP is not the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo because OpCo GP lacks a direct economic interest in Columbia OpCo and the various related party limited partner interest holders were determined not to be so closely associated that they should be aggregated. As CPPL has a significant economic interest in Columbia OpCo and has the power to direct the activities of Columbia OpCo through that interest and it  s   100%     ownership interest in OpCo GP, CPPL is determined to be the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo and consolidates Columbia OpCo in its financial statements. 
  Merger.   On March 17, 2016, CPG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), among CPG, TransCanada PipeLines Limited, a Canadian corporation ( Parent ), TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( US Parent ), Taurus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Parent ( Merger Sub ), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada Corporation, a Canadian corporation and the direct parent company of Parent ( TransCanada ). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the  Merger ) with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. The Merger did not affect the ownership of OpCo GP, but OpCo GP is indirectly managed by TransCanada after the Merger. 
   
  2.    Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  Guarantees and Indemnities.   OpCo GP entered into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of CPG. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to the parent on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the parent's intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and indemnities in existence at   September 30, 2016   and the years in which they expire were: 

Guarantees of Debt.   OpCo GP and Columbia OpCo (together with CEG, the "Guarantors") have guaranteed payment of   $2,750.0 million   in aggregated principal amount of CPG's senior notes. Each Guarantor is required to comply with covenants under the debt indenture and in the event of default the Guarantors would be obligated to pay the debt's principal and related interest.  OpCo GP does not anticipate that any of the Guarantors will have any difficulty maintaining compliance. The guarantees of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. 
  Lines and Letters of Credit.   CPPL maintained a   $500.0 million   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $50.0 million   was available for issuance of letters of credit. OpCo GP, together with CPG, CEG and Columbia OpCo, each fully guaranteed the CPPL credit facility. On June 29, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, all outstanding borrowings, facility fees and interest were paid in full and the revolving credit facility was terminated. CPG maintained a   $1,500.0 million   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $250.0 million   in letters of credit was available. OpCo GP, together with CEG and Columbia OpCo, each fully guaranteed the CPG credit facility. On July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, all existing letters of credit were migrated to a TransCanada credit facility and the CPG revolving credit facility was terminated.

  Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

CPG's commercial paper program (the  Program ) had a Program limit of up to   $1,000.0 million  . OpCo GP, together with CEG and Columbia OpCo, each agreed, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably to guarantee payment in full of the principal of and interest (if any) on the promissory notes. On June 30, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, the Program was terminated. CPG had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program at the time of termination.

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  CPG OpCo GP LLC 

Executive Overview 
  OpCo GP is a subsidiary of CPG formed in Delaware on December 5, 2007. Through the registration of CPG's senior notes, OpCo GP, as a guarantor of the notes, must comply with the reporting requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. OpCo GP has not had any assets, liabilities, operations or cash flows since its formation date. 
  The formation transactions that occurred as part of the initial public offering of CPPL resulted in OpCo GP becoming the general partner of Columbia OpCo. Columbia OpCo owns substantially all of CPG's natural gas transmission and storage assets. CPPL owns a 15.7% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo. The remaining 84.3% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo is owned by CEG, a 100% owned subsidiary of CPG. 
  On March 17, 2016, CPG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), among CPG, TransCanada PipeLines Limited, a Canadian corporation ( Parent ), TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( US Parent ), Taurus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Parent ( Merger Sub ), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada Corporation, a Canadian corporation and the direct parent company of Parent ( TransCanada ). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the  Merger ) with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. The Merger did not affect the ownership of OpCo GP, but OpCo GP is indirectly managed by TransCanada after the Merger. 
  Proposed Merger of CPPL by CPG:   On November 1, 2016, CPPL announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CPG, Pony Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CPG ( Pony Merger Sub ) and MLP GP. 
  The conflicts committee of the board of directors of MLP GP (the  GP Conflicts Committee ) and the board of directors of the MLP GP (the "GP Board") approved the merger agreement and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of CPPL and to the holders of CPPL common units unaffiliated with CPG, CEG and MLP GP (collectively, the  CPPL unaffiliated unitholders ). The GP Conflicts Committee recommended the the GP Board approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions. The GP Board resolved that the merger agreement and the merger transactions be submitted to the unitholders of CPPL at a special meeting of the unitholders for approval. The GP Board recommended that the unitholders of CPPL vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions at the special meeting of the unitholders. 
  CPG indirectly owns, through its ownership of CEG, 100% of the membership interests in MLP GP. CEG owns all of the subordinated units ( CPPL subordinated units ) representing a 46.5% limited partner interest in CPPL. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Pony Merger Sub will merge with and into CPPL at the effective time of the merger, with CPPL surviving, such that following the merger, MLP GP will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG and the sole general partner of CPPL, and CPG and CEG will be the only limited partners of CPPL. Each CPPL common unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to at the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive (i) $17.00 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon plus (ii) an additional amount of cash per CPPL common unit without any interest thereon equal to the product of (x) the number of days from and including the first day of the quarter in which the closing occurs through and including the closing date multiplied by (y) $0.00217 per CPPL common Unit (a daily distribution rate equal to the quotient of $0.1975 divided by ninety-one (91)), plus (iii) an amount equal to $0.1975 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon if the record date for the CPPL s quarterly cash distribution with respect to the quarter immediately preceding the quarter in which the closing occurs shall not have occurred prior to the effective time of the merger (the "Merger Consideration"). Incentive distribution rights of CPPL, which are owned by CEG, will be unchanged and remain outstanding as incentive distribution rights of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPPL subordinated units, which are owned by CEG, will also be unchanged and remain outstanding as CPPL subordinated units of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPG will be issued CPPL common units at the effective time of the merger equal to the number of public common units being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The parties anticipate that the merger will close in the first quarter of 2017 and that CPPL will pay the regular quarterly cash distributions to unitholders at the quarterly per unit distribution rate of $0.1975, with the declaration date and record date for each quarterly distribution to occur no later than 30 days and 42 days, respectively, after the end of each fiscal quarter. 
  Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (1) approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, by the affirmative vote or consent of holders, as of the record date

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  CPG OpCo GP LLC 

of the special meeting of CPPL s unitholders (including CEG), of (a) a majority of the outstanding CPPL common units, voting as a class, (b) a majority of the CPPL common units held by the CPPL unaffiliated unitholders, and (c) a majority of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units, voting as a class; (2) all required filings, consents, approvals, permits and authorizations in connection with the merger having been made or obtained; and (3) the absence of legal injunctions or impediments prohibiting the merger transactions. 
  Pursuant to the merger agreement, CEG delivered a consent to voting the CPPL subordinated units owned beneficially or of record by it or any of its subsidiaries in favor of the merger proposal, including the 46,811,398 CPPL subordinated units currently held by CEG, which units represent 100% of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units. 
  The merger agreement contains provisions granting both CPPL and CPG the right to terminate the merger Agreement for certain reasons, including, among others, if: (1) the merger is not completed on or before August 1, 2017; (2) any governmental authority has issued a final and nonappealable statute, rule, order, decree or regulation enjoining or prohibiting consummation of the merger; (3) under certain conditions, there has been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement by a party to the merger agreement which is not cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice from the non-breaching party (a  terminable breach  (4) CPPL does not obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders; or (5) either the GP Board, in accordance with the merger agreement, withdraws, modifies or qualifies, or proposes to publicly withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to CPG its recommendation to the unitholders of CPPL (the  CPPL Board Recommendation ) or fails to include the CPPL Board Recommendation in the proxy statement to be filed by CPPL in connection with the merger (that taking of any such action being referred to as a  CPPL Change in Recommendation ). 
  All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, except that (1) CPG and CPPL shall each bear and pay one half of the expenses incurred in connection with the proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3 filings, (2) if (a) CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a CPPL Change in Recommendation, (b) either party terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders of CPPL and prior to such special meeting, a CPPL Change in Recommendation has occurred, or if CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPPL, CPPL will pay the expenses incurred by CPG up to a maximum of $10 million, and (3) if CPPL terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPG, CPG will pay the expenses incurred by CPPL. 
  Consolidation of Columbia OpCo 
  Under ASC 810, Columbia OpCo is determined to be a VIE. Additionally, it is determined that OpCo GP is not the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo because OpCo GP lacks a direct economic interest in Columbia OpCo and the various related party LP interest holders were determined not to be so closely associated that they should be aggregated. As CPPL has a significant economic interest in Columbia OpCo and has the power to direct the activities of Columbia OpCo through that interest and its 100% ownership interest in OpCo GP, CPPL is determined to be the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo and consolidates Columbia OpCo in its financial statements. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
