References to  we  and  our  mean the Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.  
    
  The Company conducts its activities through the Operating Partnership and is its sole general partner. The partnership agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will assume and pay when due, or reimburse the Company for payment of, all costs and expenses relating to the ownership and operations of, or for the benefit of, the Operating Partnership. The partnership agreement further provides that all expenses of the Company are deemed to be incurred for the benefit of the Operating Partnership.

  This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   of the Company and the Operating Partnership. We believe combining the quarterly reports into this single report results in the following benefits:

combined reports enhance investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 

combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings in time, effort and expense; and 

combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for their review.

1.    Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  Highwoods Properties, Inc. (the  Company ) is a fully integrated real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that provides leasing, management, development, construction and other customer-related services for its properties and for third parties. The Company conducts its activities through Highwoods Realty Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ). At   September 30, 2016  , we owned or had an interest in   31.1 million   rentable square feet of in-service properties,   1.1 million   rentable square feet of properties under development and approximately   450   acres of development land. 
    
  The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned all of the Preferred Units and   99.8 million  , or   97.2%  , of the Common Units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners owned the remaining   2.8 million   Common Units. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company redeemed   60,048   Common Units for a like number of shares of Common Stock. 
    
  Common Stock Offerings 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company issued   1,547,457   and   3,624,528   shares, respectively, of Common Stock under its equity distribution agreements at an average gross sales price of   $52.79   and   $49.67   per share, respectively, and received net proceeds, after sales commissions, of   $80.5 million   and   $177.3 million  , respectively. As a result of this activity and the redemptions discussed above, the percentage of Common Units owned by the Company increased from   97.1%   at   December 31, 2015   to   97.2%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were retrospectively revised from previously reported amounts to reclassify the operations for those properties classified as discontinued operations. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the Operating Partnership, wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which the Company has the controlling interest. The Operating Partnership's Consolidated Financial Statements include wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which the Operating Partnership has the controlling interest. In addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary.     At   September 30, 2016  , we had involvement with, but are not the primary beneficiary in, an entity that we concluded to be a variable interest entity. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
    
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying unaudited consolidated financial information, in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have condensed or omitted certain notes and other information from the interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Quarterly Report as permitted by SEC rules and regulations. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1.    Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies   Continued 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") recently issued an accounting standards update ("ASU") that requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that we identify the contract with the customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when we satisfy the performance obligations. We will also be required to disclose information regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU is required to be adopted in 2018. Retrospective application is required either to all periods presented or with the cumulative effect of initial adoption recognized in the period of adoption. We are in the process of evaluating this ASU. 
    
  The FASB recently issued an ASU that amended consolidation requirements. The amendments significantly change the consolidation analysis required under GAAP and require companies to reevaluate all previous consolidation conclusions. We adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2016 and there was no impact to consolidated entities included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, in reevaluating our previous consolidation conclusions upon adoption of the ASU, we determined our   12.5%   equity interest in an unconsolidated affiliate to be an interest in a variable interest entity because certain of its limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. We do not qualify as the primary beneficiary since our obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits of the variable interest entity is less than that of the other general partner and we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the entity. Accordingly, the entity is not consolidated. At   September 30, 2016  , our maximum exposure to loss with respect to this arrangement is limited to the less than   $0.1 million   carrying value of our   12.5%   investment in the unconsolidated affiliate. 
    
  The FASB recently issued an ASU that requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability to which they relate, consistent with debt discounts, as opposed to being presented as assets. For debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities, the FASB allows the presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset. We adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2016 with retrospective application to our   December 31, 2015   Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effect of the adoption was to reclassify debt issuance costs from deferred financing and leasing costs, net of accumulated amortization, as follows:   $7.8 million   to a contra account as a deduction from the related mortgages and notes payable and   $2.1 million   to prepaid expenses and other assets. There was no effect on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  The FASB recently issued an ASU which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.  The ASU requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to the existing guidance and is effective for reporting periods beginning in 2019 with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating this ASU. 
    
  The FASB recently issued an ASU that requires, among other things, the use of a new current expected credit loss ("CECL") model in determining our allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable, accrued straight-line rents receivable and mortgages and notes receivable. The CECL model requires that we estimate our lifetime expected credit loss with respect to these receivables and record allowances that, when deducted from the balance of the receivables, represent the net amounts expected to be collected. We will also be required to disclose information about how we developed the allowances, including changes in the factors (e.g., portfolio mix, credit trends, unemployment, gross domestic product, etc.) that influenced our estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes. We will apply the ASU s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption in 2020. We are in the process of evaluating this ASU. 
    
  The FASB recently issued an ASU that adds to and clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is required to be adopted in 2018 with retrospective application required. We are in the process of evaluating this ASU.

  Acquisitions 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a building in Raleigh, NC, which delivered in 2015 and encompasses   243,000   rentable square feet, for a net purchase price of   $76.9 million  . We expensed   $0.3 million   of acquisition costs (included in general and administrative expenses) related to this acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value as determined by management based on information available at the acquisition date and on current assumptions as to future operations. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we also acquired: 

fee simple title to the land underneath   one   of our buildings in Pittsburgh, PA that was previously subject to a ground lease for a purchase price of   $18.5 million  . We expensed   $0.5 million   of acquisition costs (included in general and administrative expenses) related to this acquisition; and 

an acre of development land in Raleigh, NC for a purchase price, including capitalized acquisition costs, of   $5.8 million  . 
       
  During the second quarter of 2016, we acquired   14   acres of development land in Nashville, TN for a purchase price, including capitalized acquisition costs, of   $9.1 million  .

2.    Real Estate Assets - Continued 
    
  Dispositions 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we sold land for a sale price of   $6.8 million   and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $3.9 million  . We deferred   $0.4 million   of gain related to a portion of the sale price that was escrowed for contingent future infrastructure work.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we sold a building for a sale price of   $14.2 million   and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $5.9 million  .  
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we sold: 

substantially all of our wholly-owned Country Club Plaza assets in Kansas City (which we refer to as the  Plaza assets ) for a sale price of   $660.0 million   (before closing credits to buyer of   $4.8 million  ). We recorded gains on disposition of discontinued operations of   $414.5 million   and a gain on disposition of property of   $1.3 million   related to the land; 

a   32,000   square foot building for a sale price of   $4.7 million   (before closing credits to buyer of   $0.1 million  ) and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $1.1 million  . The buyer, which leased   79%   of the building, is a family business controlled by a director of the Company. The sale price exceeded the value set forth in an appraisal performed by a reputable independent commercial real estate services firm that has no relationship with the director or any of his affiliates; and 

a building for a sale price of   $6.4 million   (before closing credits to buyer of   $0.5 million  ) and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $2.0 million  .  

3.    Mortgages and Notes Receivable 
    
  Mortgages and notes receivable were   $9.5 million   and   $2.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We evaluate the ability to collect our mortgages and notes receivable by monitoring the leasing statistics and/or market fundamentals of these assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , our mortgages and notes receivable were not in default and there were no other indicators of impairment.  

4.    Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates 
    
  We have equity interests of up to   50.0%   in various joint ventures with unrelated third parties that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting because we have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operating and financial policies.  
    
  The following table sets forth the summarized income statements of our unconsolidated affiliates:

4.    Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates - Continued 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, 4600 Madison Associates, LP (a joint venture in which we own a   12.5%   interest) sold a building to an unrelated third party for a sale price of   $32.7 million   and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $21.3 million  . As our cost basis was different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, we recorded   $1.8 million   of gain through equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Simultaneously with the sale, the joint venture used a portion of the proceeds to pay off all   $6.3 million   of its debt. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, Concourse Center Associates, LLC (a joint venture in which we own a   50.0%   interest) sold   two   buildings and land to an unrelated third party for an aggregate sale price of   $11.0 million   and recorded losses on disposition of property of   $0.1 million  . As our cost basis was different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, we recorded   $0.4 million   of gains through equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Simultaneously with the sale, the joint venture repaid all   $6.6 million   of its debt. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, 4600 Madison Associates, LP sold land to an unrelated third party for a sale price of   $3.4 million   and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $1.0 million  . We recorded   $0.1 million   as our share of this gain through equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Simultaneously with the sale, the joint venture used all of the proceeds to pay down   $3.4 million   of its debt.

6.    Mortgages and Notes Payable - Continued 
    
  Our $  475.0 million   unsecured revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in   January 2018   and includes an accordion feature that allows for an additional $  75.0 million   of borrowing capacity subject to additional lender commitments. Assuming no defaults have occurred, we have an option to extend the maturity for   two   additional   six  -month periods. The interest rate at our current credit ratings is   LIBOR plus 110 basis points   and the annual facility fee is 20 basis points. There was $  28.0 million   and $  38.0 million   outstanding under our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016  , respectively. At both   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016  , we had $  0.2 million   of outstanding letters of credit, which reduces the availability on our revolving credit facility. As a result, the unused capacity of our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016   was $  446.8 million   and $  436.8 million  , respectively.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we prepaid without penalty the remaining   $43.6 million   balance on a secured mortgage loan with an effective interest rate of   7.5%   that was originally scheduled to mature in   August 2016  . 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we executed a   $150.0 million  ,   67  -month unsecured term loan facility. The term loan facility is originally scheduled to mature in   January 2022  . The interest rate on the term loan facility at our current credit ratings is   LIBOR plus 110 basis points  . The purpose of the term loan facility is to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other general corporate purposes. There was   $75.0 million   outstanding under our term loan facility at both   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016  .  
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we prepaid without penalty the   $350.0 million   balance on our unsecured bridge facility that was originally scheduled to mature in   March 2016  .  
    
  We are currently in compliance with financial covenants and other requirements with respect to our consolidated debt. 

7. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
       
  During the first quarter of 2016, we obtained   $150.0 million   notional amount of forward-starting swaps that effectively lock the underlying   10  -year treasury rate at   1.90%   with respect to a forecasted debt issuance expected to occur prior to March 15, 2017. The counterparties under the swaps are major financial institutions. 
    
  Our interest rate swaps have been designated as and are being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss) each reporting period. No gain or loss was recognized related to hedge ineffectiveness or to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing on our cash flow hedges during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . We have no collateral requirements related to our interest rate swaps. 
    
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. During the period from   October 1, 2016   through   September 30, 2017  , we estimate that   $2.5 million   will be reclassified to interest expense. 
    
  The following table sets forth the fair value of our derivatives:

9. 
    Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
       
  The following summarizes the three levels of inputs that we use to measure fair value. 
    
  Level 1.    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  Our Level 1 asset is our investment in marketable securities that we use to pay benefits under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Our Level 1 liability is our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation. The Company's Level 1 noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership relate to the ownership of Common Units by various individuals and entities other than the Company.  
    
  Level 2.   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. 
    
  Our Level 2 asset is the fair value of our mortgages and notes receivable. Our Level 2 liabilities include the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable and interest rate swaps. 
    
  The fair value of mortgages and notes receivable and mortgages and notes payable is estimated by the income approach utilizing contractual cash flows and market-based interest rates to approximate the price that would be paid in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments. The variable cash payments of interest rate swaps are based on the expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observed market interest rate curves. In addition, credit valuation adjustments are considered in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk, but were concluded to not be significant inputs to the calculation for the periods presented. 
    
  Level 3.   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
    
  Our Level 3 asset included our tax increment financing bond, which was not routinely traded but whose fair value was determined by the income approach utilizing contractual cash flows and market-based interest rates to estimate the projected redemption value based on quoted bid/ask prices for similar unrated municipal bonds. 
    
  Our Level 3 liability was the fair value of our financing obligation, which was estimated by the income approach to approximate the price that would be paid in an orderly transaction between market participants, utilizing: (1) contractual cash flows; (2) market-based interest rates; and (3) a number of other assumptions including demand for space, competition for customers, changes in market rental rates, costs of operation and expected ownership periods.

    Share-Based Payments 
       
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   244,664   stock options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which resulted in a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $  4.61  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company also granted   72,698   shares of time-based restricted stock and   58,054   shares of total return-based restricted stock with weighted average grant date fair values per share of $  43.59   and $  41.37  , respectively. We recorded share-based compensation expense of   $0.9 million   during each of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and $  5.4 million   and $  6.0 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $5.9 million   of total unrecognized share-based compensation costs, which will be recognized over a weighted average remaining contractual term of   2.4   years.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The Company is a fully integrated office real estate investment trust ("REIT") that owns, develops, acquires, leases and manages properties primarily in the best business districts (BBDs) of Atlanta, Greensboro, Memphis, Nashville, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond and Tampa. The Company conducts its activities through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is managed by the Company, its sole general partner. Additional information about us can be found on our website at   www.highwoods.com  . Information on our website is not part of this Quarterly Report. 
    
  You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Some of the information in this Quarterly Report may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under this section. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   continue  or other similar words. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. When considering such forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the following important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement: 

the financial condition of our customers could deteriorate; 

we may not be able to lease or re-lease second generation space, defined as previously occupied space that becomes available for lease, quickly or on as favorable terms as old leases; 

we may not be able to lease our newly constructed buildings as quickly or on as favorable terms as originally anticipated; 

we may not be able to complete development, acquisition, reinvestment, disposition or joint venture projects as quickly or on as favorable terms as anticipated; 

development activity by our competitors in our existing markets could result in an excessive supply relative to customer demand; 

our markets may suffer declines in economic growth; 

unanticipated increases in interest rates could increase our debt service costs; 

unanticipated increases in operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results; 

we may not be able to meet our liquidity requirements or obtain capital on favorable terms to fund our working capital needs and growth initiatives or repay or refinance outstanding debt upon maturity; and 

the Company could lose key executive officers. 
       
  This list of risks and uncertainties, however, is not intended to be exhaustive. You should also review the other cautionary statements we make in  Business   Risk Factors  set forth in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

Executive Summary 
    
  Our Strategic Plan focuses on: 

owning high-quality, differentiated office buildings in the BBDs of our core markets; 

improving the operating results of our existing properties through concentrated leasing, asset management, cost control and customer service efforts; 

developing and acquiring office buildings in BBDs that improve the overall quality of our portfolio and generate attractive returns over the long term for our stockholders;  

disposing of properties no longer considered to be core assets primarily due to location, age, quality and overall strategic fit; and 

maintaining a conservative and flexible balance sheet with ample liquidity to meet our funding needs and growth prospects. 
       
  Revenues 
    
  Our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing and operating the office space in our portfolio. Economic growth and employment levels in our core markets are and will continue to be important factors in predicting our future operating results. 
    
  The key components affecting our rental and other revenues are average occupancy, rental rates, cost recovery income, new developments placed in service, acquisitions and dispositions. Average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth, as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases. Average occupancy generally declines during times of slower economic growth, when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space. Asset acquisitions, dispositions and new developments placed in service directly impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy, depending upon the occupancy rate of the properties that are acquired, sold or placed in service. A further indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio. As a result, in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space, we also concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing existing leases prior to expiration. For more information regarding our lease expirations, see "Properties - Lease Expirations" in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Occupancy in our office portfolio decreased from   92.6%   at   December 31, 2015   to   92.2%   at   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016.  
    
  Whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether GAAP rents under signed new and renewal leases are higher or lower than the GAAP rents under expiring leases. Annualized rental revenues from second generation leases expiring during any particular year are generally less than 15% of our total annual rental revenues. The following table sets forth information regarding second generation office leases signed during the   third   quarter of   2016   (we define second generation office leases as leases with new customers and renewals of existing customers in office space that has been previously occupied under our ownership and leases with respect to vacant space in acquired buildings): 

__________ 
           (1) 
    Weighted average per rentable square foot on an annual basis over the lease term. 
       
  Compared to previous leases in the same office spaces, annual combined GAAP rents for new and renewal leases signed in the   third   quarter were   $26.92   per rentable square foot or   20.7%     higher  . 

33 

     Table of Contents  

We strive to maintain a diverse, stable and creditworthy customer base. We have an internal guideline whereby customers that account for more than 3% of our revenues are periodically reviewed with the Company's Board of Directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , no customer accounted for more than 3% of our cash revenues other than the Federal Government, which accounted for less than   6%   of our cash revenues on an annualized basis.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Our expenses primarily consist of rental property expenses, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. From time to time, expenses also include impairments of real estate assets. Rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operation of rental properties and include expenses that vary somewhat proportionately to occupancy levels, such as janitorial services and utilities, and expenses that do not vary based on occupancy, such as property taxes and insurance. Depreciation and amortization is a non-cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year, unless we buy, place in service or sell assets, since we depreciate our properties and related building and tenant improvement assets on a straight-line basis over fixed lives. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and employee salaries and other personnel costs, corporate overhead and short and long-term incentive compensation. 
    
  Net Operating Income 
    
  Whether or not we record increasing same property net operating income ( NOI ) depends upon our ability to garner higher rental revenues, whether from higher average occupancy, higher GAAP rents per rentable square foot or higher cost recovery income, that exceed any corresponding growth in operating expenses. Same property NOI from continuing operations was   $2.7 million  , or   3.0%  ,   higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to an increase in same property revenues of $2.6 million.  
    
  In addition to the effect of same property NOI, whether or not NOI from continuing operations increases depends upon whether the NOI from our acquired properties and development properties placed in service exceeds the NOI from sold properties. NOI from continuing operations was   $11.3 million  , or   11.7%  ,   higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   due to the impact of acquisitions in   2015   and development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016, offset by NOI lost from sold properties not classified as discontinued operations.  
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  In calculating net cash related to operating activities, depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash expenses, are added back to net income. As a result, we have historically generated a positive amount of cash from operating activities. From period to period, cash flow from operations depends primarily upon changes in our net income, as discussed more fully below under  Results of Operations,  changes in receivables and payables, and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio. 
    
  Net cash related to investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements and our acquisition, development, disposition and joint venture capital activity. During periods of significant net acquisition and/or development activity, our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities, which typically consists of cash received upon the sale of properties and distributions of capital from our joint ventures.  
    
  Net cash related to financing activities generally relates to distributions, incurrence and repayment of debt, and issuances, repurchases or redemptions of Common Stock, Common Units and Preferred Stock. We use a significant amount of our cash to fund distributions. Whether or not we have increases in the outstanding balances of debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition, disposition, development and joint venture activity. We generally use our credit facilities for daily working capital purposes, which means that during any given period, in order to minimize interest expense, we may record significant repayments and borrowings under our credit facilities. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We intend to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet with access to multiple sources of debt and equity capital and sufficient availability under our credit facilities that allows us to capitalize on favorable development and acquisition opportunities as they arise.  
    
  Rental and other revenues are our principal source of funds to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Other sources of funds for short-term liquidity needs include available working capital and borrowings under our credit facilities, which collectively had   $511.8 million   of availability at   October 17, 2016  . Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

expenses, interest and principal amortization on our debt, distributions and capital expenditures, including building improvement costs, tenant improvement costs and lease commissions. Building improvements are capital costs to maintain or enhance existing buildings not typically related to a specific customer. Tenant improvements are the costs required to customize space for the specific needs of customers. We anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities, together with cash available from borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, will be adequate to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We use our credit facilities for working capital purposes and for the short-term funding of our development and acquisition activity and, in certain instances, the repayment of other debt. The continued ability to borrow under the credit facilities allows us to quickly capitalize on strategic opportunities at short-term interest rates.  
    
  Our long-term liquidity uses generally consist of the retirement or refinancing of debt upon maturity (including mortgage debt, our credit facilities, term loans and other unsecured debt), funding of existing and new building development and land infrastructure projects and funding acquisitions of buildings and development land. Our expected future capital expenditures for started and/or committed new development projects were approximately   $216 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, we may, from time to time, retire some or all of our remaining outstanding Preferred Stock and/or unsecured debt securities through redemptions, open market repurchases, privately negotiated acquisitions or otherwise. 
    
  We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs through a combination of: 

cash flow from operating activities; 

bank term loans and borrowings under our credit facilities; 

the issuance of unsecured debt; 

the issuance of secured debt; 

the issuance of equity securities by the Company or the Operating Partnership; and 

the disposition of non-core assets. 
       
  We generally expect to grow our company on a leverage-neutral basis by maintaining a leverage ratio of under 43% as measured by the ratio of our mortgages and notes payable and outstanding preferred stock to the undepreciated book value of our assets. At   September 30, 2016  , our leverage ratio was   34.6%   and there were   103.1 million   diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding. 
    
  For a discussion regarding dividends and distributions, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Dividends and Distributions." 
    
  Investment Activity 
    
  As noted above, a key tenet of our strategic plan is to continuously upgrade the quality of our office portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions and development. We generally seek to acquire and develop office buildings that improve the average quality of our overall portfolio and deliver consistent and sustainable value for our stockholders over the long-term. Whether or not an asset acquisition or new development results in higher per share net income or funds from operations ("FFO") in any given period depends upon a number of factors, including whether the NOI for any such period exceeds the actual cost of capital used to finance the acquisition or development. Additionally, given the length of construction cycles, development projects are not placed in service until, in some cases, several years after commencement. Sales of non-core assets could result in lower per share net income or FFO in any given period in the event the resulting use of proceeds does not exceed the capitalization rate on the sold properties. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Rental and Other Revenues 
    
  Rental and other revenues were   $15.5 million  , or   10.3%  ,   higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to 2015 acquisitions, development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016 and higher same property revenues, which increased rental and other revenues by $10.7 million, $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Same property rental and other revenues were higher primarily due to an   increase   in average occupancy to   93.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   92.2%   in the

     Table of Contents  

third   quarter of   2015   and higher average GAAP rents per rentable square foot. These increases were partly offset by lost revenue of $0.9 million from property dispositions.  
    
  Operating Expenses 
    
  Rental property and other expenses were   $4.2 million  , or   7.7%  ,   higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to 2015 acquisitions and development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016, which increased operating expenses by $4.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. These increases were partly offset by a $0.4 million decrease in operating expenses from property dispositions. Same property operating expenses were relatively unchanged in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization was   $2.0 million  , or   3.8%  ,   higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to 2015 acquisitions and development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016, partly offset by property dispositions.  
    
  General and administrative expenses were   $0.9 million  , or   9.7%  ,   higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to higher company-wide base salaries and deferred compensation plan investments, partly offset by lower acquisition costs.  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was   $2.8 million  , or   13.1%  ,   lower   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to lower average debt balances, lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest.  
    
  Other Income 
    
  Other income was   $0.5 million     higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a loss on deferred compensation plan investments in 2015. 
    
  Gains on Disposition of Property 
    
  Gains on disposition of property were   $3.1 million     lower   in the   third   quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the net effect of the disposition activity in such periods. 
    
  Gain on Disposition of Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate 
    
  We recorded a gain on disposition of investment in unconsolidated affiliate of $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 due to the sale of our 20.0% interest in SF-HIW Harborview Plaza, LP to our partner. We had no comparable transaction in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
    
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was   $2.0 million     higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to our share of a gain recognized by one of our unconsolidated affiliates in 2016.  
    
  Income From Discontinued Operations 
    
  Income from discontinued operations was   $4.3 million     lower   in the   third   quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the sales of substantially all of our wholly-owned Country Club Plaza assets in Kansas City (which we refer to as the  Plaza assets ) on March 1, 2016. 
    
  Earnings Per Common Share - Diluted 
    
  Diluted earnings per common share was   $0.01     higher   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   2015   due to an increase in net income for the reasons discussed above, partly offset by an increase in the weighted average Common Shares outstanding.

  Rental and other revenues were   $53.4 million  , or   12.0%  ,   higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to 2015 acquisitions, development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016 and higher same property revenues, which increased rental and other revenues by $34.4 million, $12.4 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Same property rental and other revenues were higher primarily due to an increase in average occupancy to 92.8% in the   nine months ended September 30,   2016 from 92.0% in the   nine months ended September 30,   2015, higher average GAAP rents per rentable square foot and higher termination fees.

  Operating Expenses 
    
  Rental property and other expenses were   $14.4 million  , or   9.0%  ,   higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to 2015 acquisitions, development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016 and higher same property operating expenses, which increased operating expenses by $13.1 million, $2.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Same property operating expenses were higher primarily due to higher property taxes and repairs and maintenance, partly offset by lower utilities and property insurance. These increases were partly offset by a $1.5 million decrease in operating expenses from property dispositions. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization was   $16.0 million  , or   11.0%  ,   higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to 2015 acquisitions and development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016, partly offset by property dispositions. 
    
  General and administrative expenses were   $0.4 million  , or   1.5%  ,   higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to higher company-wide base salaries, partly offset by lower incentive compensation. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was   $5.7 million  , or   8.8%  ,   lower   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest, partly offset by higher average debt balances. 
    
  Other Income 
    
  Other income was   $0.6 million     higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to a loss on debt extinguishment and deferred compensation plan investments in 2015.

  Total gains were   $418.1 million     higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   due to the sales of the Plaza assets. 
    
  Gain on Disposition of Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate 
    
  We recorded a gain on disposition of investment in unconsolidated affiliate of $4.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the sale of our 20.0% interest in SF-HIW Harborview Plaza, LP to our partner. We had no comparable transaction in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was   $0.6 million     higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to our share of the net effect of the disposition activity by certain unconsolidated affiliates in such periods and higher leasing activity in 2016. 
    
  Income From Discontinued Operations 
    
  Income from discontinued operations was   $8.8 million     lower   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to 2015 due to the sales of the Plaza assets on March 1, 2016.

Earnings Per Common Share - Diluted 
    
  Diluted earnings per common share was   $4.29     higher   in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   due to gains from the sales of the Plaza assets and other increases in net income for the reasons discussed above, partly offset by an increase in the weighted average Common Shares outstanding. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Statements of Cash Flows 
    
  We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The following table sets forth the changes in the Company s cash flows ($ in thousands): 

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   was primarily due to higher net cash from the operations of 2015 acquisitions and development properties placed in service in 2015 and 2016. 
    
  The change in net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sales of the Plaza assets and lower acquisition activity in 2016, partly offset by the repayment of an advance from an unconsolidated affiliate in 2015 and higher investments in development in-process and higher net investments in mortgages and notes receivable in 2016.  
    
  The change in net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities in the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   as compared to   2015   was primarily due to higher net debt repayments in 2016, partly offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock in 2016. 
    
  Capitalization 
    
  The following table sets forth the Company s capitalization (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

At   September 30, 2016  , our mortgages and notes payable and outstanding preferred stock represented   26.4%   of our total capitalization and   34.6%   of the undepreciated book value of our assets. 
    
  Our mortgages and notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $129.0 million   of secured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of   4.35%   and   $1,778.9 million   of unsecured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of   3.94%  . The secured indebtedness was collateralized by real estate assets with an aggregate undepreciated book value of   $247.1

     Table of Contents  

million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $428.0 million   of our debt does not bear interest at fixed rates or is not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. 
    
  Dividends and Distributions 
    
  To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must pay dividends to stockholders that are at least 90.0% of its annual REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. The partnership agreement requires the Operating Partnership to distribute at least enough cash for the Company to be able to pay such dividends. The Company's REIT taxable income, as determined by the federal tax laws, does not equal its net income under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). In addition, although capital gains are not required to be distributed to maintain REIT status, capital gains, if any, are subject to federal and state income tax unless such gains are distributed to stockholders. 
    
  Cash dividends and distributions reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available for other business purposes, including funding debt maturities or future growth initiatives. The amount of future distributions that will be made is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. The following factors will affect such cash flows and, accordingly, influence the decisions of the Company s Board of Directors regarding dividends and distributions: 

debt service requirements after taking into account debt covenants and the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness and the availability of alternative sources of debt and equity capital and their impact on our ability to refinance existing debt and grow our business;  

scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases;  

changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases;  

changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and execution of leases for newly acquired or developed properties;  

changes in operating expenses;  

anticipated leasing capital expenditures attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases;  

anticipated building improvements; and  

expected cash flows from financing and investing activities, including from the sale of assets generating taxable gains to the extent such assets are not sold in a tax-deferred exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or another tax-free or tax-deferred transaction. 
       
  Of the net proceeds received for the sales of the Plaza assets during the first quarter of 2016, we used all but approximately $205 million of such proceeds to acquire real estate assets in 1031 exchanges qualifying for tax-deferred treatment. During the third quarter of 2016, we used all remaining net sale proceeds, which were being held in escrow, to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The Company anticipates paying a special cash dividend of at least $0.75 per share no later than January 31, 2017 to stockholders of record no later than December 31, 2016. The exact amount of the special dividend, which depends upon a variety of factors such as the amount of any taxable gains resulting from potential dispositions and the amount and characterization of cash receipts and outlays throughout the remainder of the year, will be finalized by the end of 2016 and could be up to $0.25 per share higher.  
    
  Investment Activity 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a building in Raleigh, NC, which delivered in 2015 and encompasses   243,000   rentable square feet, for a net purchase price of   $76.9 million  . We expensed   $0.3 million   of acquisition costs (included in general and administrative expenses) related to this acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value as determined by management based on information available at the acquisition date and on current assumptions as to future operations. We have invested or intend to invest an additional   $6.6 million   of planned near-term building improvements and leasing capital expenditures to bring the property to stabilization. Based on the total anticipated investment of   $83.5 million  , the anticipated capitalization rate for the acquisition of this building, which was   70.0%   leased as of the closing date, is   7.2%   using projected annual GAAP net operating income upon stabilization, which is projected to occur in 2018. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. See  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.

During the third quarter of 2016, we also acquired: 

fee simple title to the land underneath   one   of our buildings in Pittsburgh, PA that was previously subject to a ground lease for a purchase price of   $18.5 million  . We expensed   $0.5 million   of acquisition costs (included in general and administrative expenses) related to this acquisition; and 

an acre of development land in Raleigh, NC for a purchase price, including capitalized acquisition costs, of   $5.8 million  . 
       
  In the normal course of business, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions. As a result, from time to time, we may have one or more potential acquisitions under consideration that are in varying stages of evaluation, negotiation or due diligence, including potential acquisitions that are subject to non-binding letters of intent or enforceable contracts. Consummation of any transaction is subject to a number of contingencies, including the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. No assurances can be provided that we will acquire any properties in the future. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Recent and future acquisitions and development properties may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations and may require renovation and development costs exceeding our estimates" in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we sold land for a sale price of   $6.8 million   and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $3.9 million  . We deferred   $0.4 million   of gain related to a portion of the sale price that was escrowed for contingent future infrastructure work. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were developing   1.2 million   rentable square feet of office properties. The following table summarizes these announced and in-process developments:

  Financing Activity 
    
  We have entered into separate equity distribution agreements with each of Jefferies LLC, Robert W. Baird   Co. Incorporated, BB T Capital Markets, a division of BB T Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, Capital One Securities, Inc., Comerica Securities, Inc., Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc., Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC, Piper Jaffray   Co., RBC Capital Markets, LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Under the terms of the equity distribution agreements, the Company may offer and sell up to $250.0 million in aggregate gross sales price of shares of Common Stock from time to time through such firms, acting as agents of the Company or as principals. Sales of the shares, if any, may be made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or as otherwise agreed with any of such firms. During the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company issued   1,547,457   shares of Common Stock at an average gross sales price of   $52.79   per share and received net proceeds, after sales commissions, of   $80.5 million  . We paid an aggregate of   $1.2 million   in sales commissions to Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Capital One Securities, Inc., Piper Jaffray   Co. and BB T Capital Markets during the   third   quarter of   2016  .  
    
  Our $  475.0 million   unsecured revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in   January 2018   and includes an accordion feature that allows for an additional $  75.0 million   of borrowing capacity subject to additional lender commitments. Assuming no defaults have occurred, we have an option to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods. The interest rate at our current credit ratings is LIBOR plus 110 basis points and the annual facility fee is 20 basis points. The interest rate and facility fee are based on the higher of the publicly announced ratings from Moody's Investors Service or Standard   Poor's Ratings

Services. There was $  28.0 million   and $  38.0 million   outstanding under our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016  , respectively. At both   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016  , we had $  0.2 million   of outstanding letters of credit, which reduces the availability on our revolving credit facility. As a result, the unused capacity of our revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016   was $  446.8 million   and $  436.8 million  , respectively.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we executed a   $150.0 million  ,   67  -month unsecured term loan facility. The term loan facility is originally scheduled to mature in   January 2022  . The interest rate on the term loan facility at our current credit ratings is   LIBOR plus 110 basis points  . The interest rate is based on the higher of the publicly announced ratings from Moody's Investors Service or Standard   Poor's Ratings Services. The financial and other covenants under the term loan facility are similar to our revolving credit facility. The purpose of the term loan facility is to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and other general corporate purposes. There was   $75.0 million   outstanding under our term loan facility at both   September 30, 2016   and   October 17, 2016  .  
    
  We are currently in compliance with financial covenants and other requirements with respect to our consolidated debt. Although we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and ratios for at least the next year, depending upon our future operating performance, property and financing transactions and general economic conditions, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be in compliance. 
    
  Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility and bank term loans require us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial requirements.  
    
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, 4600 Madison Associates, LP (a joint venture in which we own a   12.5%   interest) sold a building to an unrelated third party for a sale price of   $32.7 million   and recorded a gain on disposition of property of   $21.3 million  . As our cost basis was different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level, we recorded   $1.8 million   of gain through equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Simultaneously with the sale, the joint venture used a portion of the proceeds to pay off all   $6.3 million   of its debt. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  There were no changes made by management to the critical accounting policies in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . For a description of our critical accounting estimates, see  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Information 
    
  The Company believes that FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity REIT. Because these FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation, amortization and impairments of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. Management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the use of FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's performance relative to its competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities. 
    
  FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share are non-GAAP financial measures and therefore do not represent net income or net income per share as defined by GAAP. Net income and net income per share as defined by GAAP are the most relevant measures in determining the Company's operating performance because these FFO measures include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation, amortization and impairments. Furthermore, FFO available for common stockholders per share does not depict the amount that accrues directly to the stockholders' benefit. Accordingly, FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share should never be considered as alternatives to net income, net income available for common stockholders, or net income available for common stockholders per share as indicators of the Company's operating performance. 

41 

     Table of Contents  

The Company's presentation of FFO is consistent with FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is calculated as follows: 

Net income/(loss) computed in accordance with GAAP; 

Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated affiliates; 

Plus depreciation and amortization of depreciable operating properties; 

Less gains, or plus losses, from sales of depreciable operating properties, plus impairments on depreciable operating properties and excluding items that are classified as extraordinary items under GAAP; 

Plus or minus our share of adjustments, including depreciation and amortization of depreciable operating properties, for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures (to reflect funds from operations on the same basis); and 

Plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization and gains/(losses) on sales of depreciable operating properties, plus impairments on depreciable operating properties, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated affiliates related to discontinued operations. 
       
  In calculating FFO, the Company includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, which the Company believes is consistent with standard industry practice for REITs that operate through an UPREIT structure. The Company believes that it is important to present FFO on an as-converted basis since all of the Common Units not owned by the Company are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for shares of its Common Stock. 
    
  The following table sets forth the Company's FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share ($ in thousands, except per share amounts):  

__________ 
           (1) 
    Includes assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive Common Stock equivalents. 
       
  In addition, the Company believes NOI from continuing operations and same property NOI are useful supplemental measures of the Company s property operating performance because such metrics provide a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning real estate assets and a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO. The Company defines NOI as rental and other revenues from continuing operations, less rental property and other expenses from continuing operations. The Company defines cash NOI as NOI less lease termination fees, straight-line rent, amortization of lease

incentives and amortization of acquired above and below market leases. Other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate NOI and same property NOI. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our same property portfolio consisted of   222   in-service properties encompassing   26.8 million   rentable square feet that were wholly owned during the entirety of the periods presented (from January 1,   2015   to   September 30, 2016  ). As of   December 31, 2015  , our same property portfolio consisted of   221   in-service properties encompassing   26.2 million   rentable square feet that were wholly owned during the entirety of the periods presented (from January 1,   2014   to   December 31, 2015  ). The change in our same property portfolio was due to the addition of   three   properties encompassing   0.7 million   rentable square feet acquired during   2014   and   one   newly developed property encompassing   0.1 million   rentable square feet placed in service during   2014  .

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  For information regarding our market risk as of June 30, 2016, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  SEC rules require us to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our annual and periodic reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership were each effective at the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
    
  SEC rules also require us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. There were also no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.
