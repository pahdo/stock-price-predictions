Statements   

This
document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements
of historical fact are  forward-looking statements , including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue
or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements
concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements

forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except for our ongoing obligation
to disclose material information as required by the federal securities laws, we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to
update any forward-looking statement.  

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ
materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results
of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. Some of
the key factors impacting these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

our
    ability to continue to purchase yew cuttings from our various suppliers at relatively stable prices;

    dependence on a small number of customers for our yew raw materials, including a related party ;

    ability to market successfully yew raw materials used in the manufacture of traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM );   

industry-wide
    market factors and regulatory and other developments affecting our operations;   

our
    ability to sustain revenues should the Chinese economy slow from its current rate of growth;   

continued
    preferential tax treatment for the sale of yew trees and potted yew trees;   

uncertainties
    about involvement of the Chinese government in business in the People s Republic of China (the  PRC  or
     China ) generally; and   

any
    change in the rate of exchange of the Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ) to the U.S. dollar, which could affect currency
    translations of our results of operations, which are earned in RMB but reported in dollars;   

industry-wide
    market factors and regulatory and other developments affecting our operations;   

any
    impairment of any of our assets;   

a
    slowdown in the Chinese economy; and   

risks
    related to changes in accounting interpretations.   

For
a detailed description of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in

NOTE 1 -  ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL
ACTIVITIES   

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from
the audited consolidated financial statements of Yew Bio-Pharm Group, Inc. (individually  YBP  and collectively with
its subsidiaries and operating variable interest entity, the  Company ). The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated
financial statements included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the financial position as
of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
have been made. 

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The Company continually evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, income
taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that it believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these
estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Certain amounts from
prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This reclassification has
resulted in no changes to the Company s accumulated deficit or net loss presented.

NOTE 2     PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION    

The consolidated financial
statements include the financial statements of YBP, its subsidiaries and operating VIE, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 

Pursuant to a restructuring
plan intended to ensure compliance with applicable PRC laws and regulations (the  Second Restructure ), on November
5, 2010, JSJ entered into a series of contractual arrangements (the  Contractual Arrangements ) with HDS and/or Zhiguo
Wang, his wife Guifang Qi and Xingming Han (collectively with Mr. Wang and Madame Qi, the  HDS Shareholders ), as described
below: 

Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement . Pursuant to the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement between JSJ and HDS (the  Business Cooperation Agreement ), JSJ has the exclusive right to provide to HDS general business operation services, including advice and strategic planning, as well as consulting services related to technology, research and development, human resources, marketing and other services deemed necessary (collectively, the  Services ). Under the Business Cooperation Agreement, JSJ has exclusive and proprietary rights and interests in all rights, ownership, interests and intellectual properties arising out of or created during the performance of the Business Cooperation Agreement, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, patent applications, software and trade secrets. HDS shall pay to JSJ a monthly consulting service fee (the  Service Fee ) in RMB that is equal to 100% of the monthly net income of HDS. Upon the prior written consent by JSJ, the rate of Service Fee may be adjusted pursuant to the operational needs of HDS. Within 30 days after the end of each month, HDS shall (a) deliver to JSJ the management accounts and operating statistics of HDS for such month, including the net income of HDS during such month (the  Monthly Net Income ), and (b) pay 80% of such Monthly Net Income to JSJ (each such payment, a  Monthly Payment ). Within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year, HDS shall (a) deliver to JSJ financial statements of HDS for such fiscal year, which shall be audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant approved by JSJ, and (b) pay an amount to JSJ equal to the shortfall, if any, of the aggregate net income of HDS for such fiscal year, as shown in such audited financial statements, as compared to the aggregate amount of the Monthly Payments paid by HDS to JSJ in such fiscal year. HDS also granted an irrevocable and exclusive option to JSJ to purchase any and all of the assets of HDS, to the extent permitted under PRC law, at the lowest price permitted by PRC law. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Business Cooperation Agreement or other agreements separately executed between JSJ and HDS, the Business Cooperation Agreement is for a term of ten years and expires on November 5, 2020; however, the term of the Business Cooperation Agreement may be extended if confirmed in writing by JSJ prior to the expiration of the term thereof. The period of the extended term shall be determined exclusively by JSJ and HDS shall accept such extended term unconditionally. Unless JSJ commits gross negligence, or a fraudulent act, against HDS, HDS shall not terminate the Business Cooperation Agreement prior to the expiration of the term, including any extended term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, JSJ shall have the right to terminate the Business Cooperation Agreement at any time upon giving 30 days  prior written notice to HDS.   

Exclusive Option Agreement  .  Under an Exclusive Option Agreement among JSJ, HDS and each HDS Shareholder (individually, an  Option Agreement ), the terms of which are substantively identical to each other, each HDS Shareholder has granted JSJ or its designee the irrevocable and exclusive right to purchase, to the extent permitted under PRC law, all or any part of the HDS Shareholder s equity interests in HDS (the  Equity Interest Purchase Option ) for RMB10. If an appraisal is required by PRC laws at the time when and if JSJ exercises the Equity Interest Purchase Option, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and, based upon the appraisal, make a necessary adjustment to the purchase price so that it complies with any and all then applicable PRC laws. Without the consent of JSJ, the HDS Shareholders shall not sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of their respective shares of HDS stock. Additionally, without the prior consent of JSJ, the HDS Shareholders shall not in any manner supplement, change or amend the articles of association and bylaws of HDS, increase or decrease its registered capital, change the structure of its registered capital in any other manner, or engage in any transactions that could materially affect HDS  assets, liabilities, rights or operations, including, without limitation, the incurrence or assumption of any indebtedness except incurred in the ordinary course of business, execute any major contract over RMB500,000, sell or purchase any assets or rights, incur of any encumbrance on any of its assets or intellectual property rights in favor of a third party or transfer of any agreements relating to its business operation to any third party. The term of each Option Agreement is ten years commencing on November 5, 2020 and may be extended at the sole election of JSJ.   

Equity Interest Pledge Agreement .   In order to guarantee HDS  performance of its obligations under the Business Cooperation Agreement, each HDS Shareholder, JSJ and HDS entered into an Equity Interest Pledge Agreement (individually, a  Pledge Agreement ), the terms of which are substantially similar to each other. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, each HDS Shareholder pledged all of his or her equity interest in HDS to JSJ. If HDS or the HDS Shareholders breach their respective contractual obligations and such breach is not remedied to the satisfaction of JSJ within 20 days after the giving of notice of breach, JSJ, as pledgee, will be entitled to exercise certain rights, including the right to foreclose upon and sell the pledged equity interests. During the term of the Pledge Agreement, the HDS Shareholder shall not transfer his or her equity interest in HDS or place or otherwise permit any other security interest of other encumbrance to be placed on such equity interest. Upon the full payment of the Service Fee under the Business Cooperation Agreement and upon the termination of HDS  obligations thereunder, the Pledge Agreement shall be terminated.   

Power of Attorney  .  Under the Power of Attorney executed by each HDS Shareholder (each, a  Power of Attorney ), the terms of which are substantially similar to each other, JSJ has been granted an exclusive, irrevocable power of attorney to take actions in the place and stead of the HDS Shareholders, to act on behalf of the HDS Shareholder as his or her exclusive agent and attorney with respect to all matters concerning the HDS Shareholder s equity interests in HDS, including without limitation, the right to: 1) attend shareholders  meetings of HDS; 2) exercise all the HDS Shareholders  rights, including voting rights under PRC laws and HDS  Articles of Association, including but not limited to the sale or transfer or pledge or disposition of the HDS Shareholder s equity interests in HDS in whole or in part; and 3) designate and appoint on behalf of the HDS Shareholders the legal representative, executive director, supervisor, manager and other senior management of HDS.   

To the extent that
the Contractual Arrangements are enforceable under PRC law, as from time to time interpreted by relevant state agencies, they constitute
the valid and binding obligations of each of the parties to each such agreement. 

The Company believes
that HDS is considered a VIE under ASC 810  Consolidation , because the equity investors in HDS no longer have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and the Company, through JSJ, is the primary beneficiary of HDS and controls
HDS  operations. Accordingly, HDS has been consolidated as a deemed subsidiary into YBP as a reporting company under ASC
810. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company agreed to waive all management fees to be payable by HDS and the Company expects to waive such management fees
in the near future due to a need of working capital in HDS to expand HDS  operations. 

YBP has no direct or
indirect legal or equity ownership interest in HDS. However, through the Contractual Arrangements, the stockholders of HDS have
assigned all their rights as stockholders, including voting rights and disposition rights of their equity interests in HDS to JSJ,
our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary. YBP is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of HDS and the financial statements of HDS are
consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying
amount and classification of the assets and liabilities in the Company s balance sheets that relate to the Company s
VIE and VIE s subsidiary are as follows: 

NOTE 3    INVENTORIES   

Inventories consisted
of raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods-handicrafts, yew candles and pine needle extracts, yew seedlings, and other
trees, which consist of larix, spruce and poplar trees. The Company classifies its inventories based on its historical and anticipated
levels of sales; any inventory in excess of its normal operating cycle of one year is classified as long-term on its consolidated
balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventories consisted of the following: 

NOTE 4    TAXES   

(a) Federal Income Tax and Enterprise
Income Taxes  

The Company is registered
in the State of Nevada and is subject to the United States federal income tax at a tax rate of 34%. No provision for income taxes
in the U.S. has been made as the Company had no U.S. taxable income as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company s
subsidiary, VIE and its subsidiary, JSJ, HDS, and HYF, respectively, incorporated in the PRC, are subject to PRC s Enterprise
Income Tax. Pursuant to the PRC Income Tax Laws, Enterprise Income Taxes ( EIT ) is generally imposed at 25%. However,
HDS has been named as a leading enterprise in the agricultural industry and awarded with a tax exemption through December 31, 2058
with exceptions of handicrafts, yew candles, pine needle extract and wood ear mushroom sold, which are not within the scope of
agricultural area. 

The combined effects
of the income tax expense exemptions and tax reductions available to the Company for the three months and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

The table below summarizes
the difference between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company s effective tax rate for the three months and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are provided for significant income and expense items recognized in different years for income tax and financial
reporting purposes. Temporary differences, which give rise to a net deferred tax asset for the Company as of September 30, 2016
and 2015, are as follows: 

(b) Value Added Taxes ( VAT )  

The applicable VAT
tax rate is 13% for agricultural products and 17% for handicrafts sold in the PRC. In accordance with VAT regulations in the PRC,
the Company is exempt from paying VAT on its yew raw materials and yew trees sales as an agricultural corps cultivating company
up to December 31, 2016. VAT payable in the PRC is charged on an aggregated basis at the applicable rate on the full price collected
for the goods sold or taxable services provided and less any deductible VAT already paid by the taxpayer on purchases of goods
in the same fiscal year.    

NOTE 5    SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

NOTE 10    SEGMENT INFORMATION   

ASC 280 requires use
of the  management approach  model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company s
management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments
are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates
a company. 

For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company operated in five reportable business segments: (1) the TCM raw materials
segment, consisting of the production and sale of yew raw materials or yew tree extracts used in the manufacture of TCM; (2) the
yew tree segment, consisting of the growth and sale of yew tree seedlings and mature trees; (3) the handicrafts segment, consisting
of the manufacture and sale of handicrafts and furniture made of yew timber; (4) the wood ear mushroom segment, consisting of the
sale of wood ear mushroom; and (5) Others, currently consisting of the sale of yew candles, pine needle extracts and dietary supplement
named  Auri Essence . The Company s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products.
They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. All of the Company s operations except
the sales of dietary supplement are conducted in the PRC. 

Information with respect
to these reportable business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

The Company does not
allocate any selling, general and administrative expenses, other income/expenses to its reportable segments because these activities
are managed at a corporate level. In addition, the specified amounts for interest expense and income tax expense are not included
in the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and these specified amounts are not regularly
provided to the chief operating decision maker. Therefore, the Company has not disclosed interest expense and income tax expense
for each reportable segment. 

Asset information by
reportable segment is not reported to or reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and, therefore, the Company has not disclosed
asset information for each reportable segment. The Company s operations are located in the PRC. All revenues are derived
from customers in the PRC. All of the Company s operating assets are located in the PRC. 

NOTE 11    COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES

10,000 yew seedlings annually. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company didn t make sales under

NOTE 12    RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing . The amendments
in this ASU add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve the operability and understandability
of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective
date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606.
Public entities should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting
periods therein. Early application for public entities is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The amendments in this ASU,
among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectibility criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an
entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify
that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity
to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying
the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price
to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a
contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application,
and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required
to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. The effective date of these amendments is at the same
date that Topic 606 is effective. Topic 606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . These amendments
provide cash flow statement classification guidance for: 1. Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; 2. Settlement of Zero-Coupon
Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest
Rate of the Borrowing; 3. Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; 4. Proceeds from the Settlement
of Insurance Claims; 5. Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance
Policies; 6. Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; 7. Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and 8.
Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments in this ASU are effective for
public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact
of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,
 Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control . These amendments
change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a
reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through
related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic
of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity), the amendments require that
reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, to include all of its
direct variable interests in a variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a variable
interest entity held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity adopts
the pending content that links to this paragraph in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning
of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The

2015, and consolidated financial conditions as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 should be read in conjunction with

Overview   

We
are a major grower and seller of yew trees and manufacturer of products made from yew trees, including handicrafts. We also sell
branches and leaves of yew trees for the manufacture of TCM containing taxol, which TCM has been approved in the PRC for use as
a secondary treatment of certain cancers, meaning it must be administered in combination with other pharmaceutical drugs. The
yew industry is highly regulated in the PRC because the Northeast yew tree is considered an endangered species. We also started
to sell yew candles, pine needle extracts and dietary supplement from the third and fourth quarters of 2015.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we operated in five reportable business segments: (1) the TCM raw
materials segment, consisting of the production and sale of yew raw materials or yew tree extracts used in the manufacture of
TCM; (2) the yew tree segment, consisting of the growth and sale of yew tree seedlings and mature trees; (3) the handicrafts segment,
consisting of the manufacture and sale of handicrafts and furniture made of yew timber; (4) the wood ear mushroom segment, consisting
of the sale of wood ear mushroom; and (5) the  Others  segment, consisting of the sales of yew candles, pine needle
extracts and dietary supplement named  Auri Essence . Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products. The five business segments are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations.
All of the Company s operations except for the dietary supplement sales are conducted in the PRC for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016.

approximately 0.01% of consolidated revenue; and the sales of others represented approximately 53.13% of consolidated revenue.
For the three months ended September 30, 2015, revenues from the sales of TCM raw materials represented approximately 56.9% of
consolidated revenue (including 57% of consolidated revenues from a related party); sales of yew trees represented approximately
1.9% of consolidated revenue; sales of wood ear mushroom represented approximately 2.7% of consolidated revenue; sales of handicrafts
represented approximately 0.3% of consolidated revenue; and the sales of others represented approximately 38.1% of consolidated
revenue.   

YBP s
revenues were mostly generated by HDS and in the PRC. The expenses (approximately $565,747 and $1,052,160 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively) incurred in the U.S. were primarily related to fulfilling the reporting requirements
of public listed company, stock-based compensation, office daily operations and other costs. As of September 30, 2016, YBP had
approximately $1,260,080 in cash and held the 100% equity interests in its subsidiaries Yew HK and JSJ. Yew HK itself has no business
operations or assets other than holding of equity interests in JSJ. JSJ has no business operations and assets with a book value
of approximately $3,350, including approximately $3,350 in cash at September 30, 2016. JSJ also holds the VIE interests in HDS
through the contractual arrangements (the  Contractual Arrangements ) described in Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. On November 4, 2014, HDS established a new subsidiary, Harbin Yew Food Co. LTD. ( HYF ), to develop and
cultivate wood ear mushroom. As of June 30, 2016, HYF had started pilot production but there was not sales yet. In the event that
we are unable to enforce the Contractual Agreements, we may not be able to exert effective control over HDS and HYF, and our ability
to conduct our business may be materially and adversely affected. If the applicable PRC authorities invalidate our Contractual
Agreements for any violation of PRC laws, rules and regulations, we would lose control of the VIE and its subsidiary resulting
in its deconsolidation in financial reporting and severe loss in our market valuation.  

Critical
accounting policies and estimates   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates,
including those related to bad debts, allowance for obsolete inventory, and the classification of short and long-term inventory,
the useful life of property and equipment and intangible assets, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, write-down in value
of inventory, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates
and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.  

Variable
interest entities   

Pursuant
to ASC 810 and related subtopics related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, we are required to include in our
consolidated financial statements the financial statements of VIEs. The accounting standards require a VIE to be consolidated
by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of
the VIE s residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which we, through contractual arrangements, bear the risk of, and
enjoy the rewards normally associated with ownership of the entity, and therefore we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.
HDS is considered a VIE, and we are the primary beneficiary. We entered into agreements with HDS pursuant to which we shall receive
100% of HDS s net income. In accordance with these agreements, HDS shall pay consulting fees equal to 100% of its net income
to our wholly-owned subsidiary, JSJ. JSJ shall supply the technology and administrative services needed to service the HDS.  

The
accounts of HDS are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. As a VIE, HDS  sales are included in our total
sales, its income from operations is consolidated with ours, and our net income includes all of HDS  net income, and their
assets and liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets. The VIEs do not have any non-controlling interest and,
accordingly, we did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us. Because of the contractual arrangements,
we have pecuniary interest in HDS that requires consolidation of HDS  financial statements with our financial statements.  

As
required by ASC 810-10, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of HDS which is
identified as a VIE of us. A quality assessment begins with an understanding of the nature of the risks in the entity as well
as the nature of the entity s activities including terms of the contracts entered into by the entity, ownership interests
issued by the entity and the parties involved in the design of the entity. The significant terms of the agreements between us
and HDS are discussed above in the  Corporate Structure and Recapitalization - Second Restructure  section. Our assessment
on the involvement with HDS reveals that we have the absolute power to direct the most significant activities that impact the
economic performance of HDS. JSJ, our wholly own subsidiary, is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from HDS activities
and is entitled to receive a majority of HDS s expected residual returns. In addition, HDS  shareholders have pledged
their equity interest in HDS to JSJ, irrevocably granted JSJ an exclusive option to purchase, to the extent permitted under PRC
Law, all or part of the equity interests in HDS and agreed to entrust all the rights to exercise their voting power to the person(s)
appointed by JSJ. Under the accounting guidance, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of HDS and the results of HDS 
operation are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes.  

Accordingly,
as a VIE, HDS  sales are included in our total sales, its income from operations is consolidated with our income from operations
and our net income includes all of HDS  net income. All the equity (net assets) and profits (losses) of HDS are attributed
to us. Therefore, no non-controlling interest in HDS is presented in our consolidated financial statements. As we do not have
any non-controlling interest and, accordingly, did not subtract any net income in calculating the net income attributable to us.
Because of the Contractual Arrangements, YBP has a pecuniary interest in HDS that requires consolidation of HDS  financial
statements with those of ours.  

Additionally,
pursuant to ASC 805, as YBP and HDS are under the common control of the HDS Shareholders, the Second Restructure was accounted
for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. As a result, our historical amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements give retrospective effect to the Second Restructure, whereby our assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical
carrying values and their operations are presented as if they were consolidated for all periods presented, with our results of
operations being consolidated from the date of the Second Transfer Agreement. The accounts of HDS are consolidated in the accompanying
financial statements.  

Accounts
receivable   

Accounts
receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses. We review the accounts receivable balance on a periodic basis and make general and specific allowances when there is doubt
as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, we consider
many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer s historical payment history, its current credit-worthiness and
current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. We recognize the probability of the
collection for each customer and believe the amount of the balance as of September 30, 2016 could be collected and accordingly,
based on a review of our outstanding balances, we did not record any allowance for doubtful accounts.  

Inventories   

Inventories
consisted of raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods-handicrafts, yew seedlings, yew candles and other trees (consisting
of larix, spruce and poplar trees). We classify our inventories based on our historical and anticipated levels of sales; any inventory
in excess of its normal operating cycle of one year is classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market value utilizing the weighted average method. Raw materials primarily include yew timber
used in the production of products such as handicrafts, furniture and other products containing yew timber. Finished goods-handicraft
and yew seedlings include direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead.  

We
estimate the amount of the excess inventories by comparing inventory on hand with the estimated sales that can be sold within
our normal operating cycle of one year. Any inventory in excess of our current requirements based on historical and anticipated
levels of sales is classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. Our classification of long-term inventory requires
us to estimate the portion of inventory that can be realized over the next 12 months.  

To
estimate the amount of slow-moving or obsolete inventories, we analyze movement of our products, monitor competing products and
technologies and evaluate acceptance of our products. Periodically, we identify inventories that cannot be sold at all or can
only be sold at deeply discounted prices. An allowance will be established if management determines that certain inventories may
not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand,
we will record reserves for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated market value.  

Our
handicraft and yew furniture products are hand-made by traditional Chinese artisans.  

In
accordance with ASC 905,  Agriculture , our costs of growing yew seedlings are accumulated until the time of harvest
and are reported at the lower of cost or market.  

Property
and equipment   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis (after taking into account their respective estimated
residual value) over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major
replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. We examine the
possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded
value may not be recoverable. The estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Building    
         15 years      
 
     Machinery and equipment    
         10 years      
 
     Office equipment    
         3 years      
 
     Leasehold improvement    
         5 years      
 
     Motor vehicles    
         4 years      

Land
use rights and yew forest assets   

All
land in the PRC is owned by the PRC government and cannot be sold to any individual or company. We have recorded the amounts paid
to the PRC government to acquire long-term interests to utilize land and yew forests as land use rights and yew forest assets.
This type of arrangement is common for the use of land in the PRC. Yew trees on land containing yew tree forests are used to supply
raw materials such as branches, leaves and fruit to us that will be used to manufacture our products. We amortize these land and
yew forest use rights over the term of the respective land and yew forest use right, which ranges from 45 to 50 years. The lease
agreements do not have any renewal option and we have no further obligations to the lessor. We record the amortization of these
land and forest use rights as part of our cost of revenues.  

Revenue
recognition   

We
generate our revenue from sales of yew seedling products, sales of yew raw materials for medical application, sales of yew handicraft
products, sales of  Others  including yew candles, pine needle extracts and dietary supplement and sales of wood ear
mushroom. Pursuant to the guidance of ASC 605 and ASC 360, we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
assured, and no significant obligations remain.  

Income
taxes   

We
are governed by the Income Tax Law of the PRC, Hong Kong and the United States. We account for income tax using the liability
method prescribed by ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will
be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to offset deferred
tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence; it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the
period that includes the enactment date.  

We
apply the provisions of ASC 740-10-50,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , which provides clarification
related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods
remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute
of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could
be material to our results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations
for the given period. Currently, we have no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in
the future.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock
based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award. The Accounting Standards
Codification also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on
the grant-date fair value of the award.  

Pursuant
to ASC 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement
date.  The expense is recognized over the period of services or the vesting period, whichever is applicable. Until the measurement
date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We record compensation expense based on the fair
value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third-parties are then revalued, or the total compensation
is recalculated based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing . The amendments in this ASU add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve
the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle
of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective
date and transition requirements in Topic 606. Public entities should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. Early application for public entities is permitted only
as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients . The amendments in this ASU, among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectibility criterion
for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other
similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception;
(4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before
the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining
the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify
that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized
under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance
in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of
adoption. The effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. Topic 606 is effective for public
entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company
is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.    

Currency
exchange rates   

Our
functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries and VIE is the RMB. All of our
sales are denominated in RMB. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect our reported levels of
revenues and profitability as the results of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. In particular,
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various
foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and RMB affect our gross
and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses.  

Our
exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains or losses resulting from timing differences between signing
of sales contracts and settling of these contracts. Furthermore, we translate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies into RMB, the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries. Our results of operations and cash flow are translated
at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end
of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our
statement of shareholders  equity. We have not used any forward contracts, currency options or borrowings to hedge our exposure
to foreign currency exchange risk. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations
and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.  

Our
financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of our parent company. The functional currency
of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates is RMB. To the extent we hold assets denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation
of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could result in a charge in our statement of operations and a reduction in the value of our
U.S. dollar denominated assets. On the other hand, a decline in the value of RMB against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S.
dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results.  

Recently
enacted JOBS Act   

We
qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the recently enacted JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and
intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other
things, we will not be required to:  

Have
    an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;   

Submit
    certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency    

Obtain
    shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and   

Disclose
    certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
    of the Chief Executive s compensation to median employee compensation.   

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated
filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our
ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding
three-year period.  

Until
such time, however, because the JOBS Act has only recently been enacted, we cannot predict whether investors will find our stock
less attractive because of the more limited disclosure requirements that we may be entitled to follow and other exemptions on
which we are relying while we are an  emerging growth company . If some investors find our common stock less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, in dollars. The discussion following
the table is based on these results:  

Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had total revenues of $14,667,099, as compared to $4,997,201 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $9,669,898 or 194%. The increase in total revenue was attributable to the increase in
revenues from TCM raw materials and the  Others  segments.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had total revenues of $39,347,578, as compared to $12,306,578 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $27,041,000 or 220%. The increase in total revenue was attributable to the increase in
revenues from TCM raw materials and the  Others  segments.  

Total
revenue is summarized as follows:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015, the increase in revenue of TCM raw material was mainly
attributable to the increase in demand from our related party, Yew Pharmaceutical. The decrease in revenue of yew tree was mainly
attributable to the Company s strategy adjustment to reserve more yew trees for future TCM raw materials sales. The decrease
in revenue of handicrafts was mainly attributable to the decrease in market demand and normal sales fluctuation. We did not have
wood ear mushroom sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the decrease in market demand and we are still exploring
on various customer bases. The  Others  segment includes the sales of yew candles, pine needle extracts and dietary
supplement named  Auri Essence  that the Company started to sell in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. The increase
in revenues of  Others  segment was mainly attributable to the increases with sales of yew candles and pine needle
extracts.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015, the increase in revenue of TCM raw material was mainly
attributable to the increase in demand from our related party, Yew Pharmaceutical. The decrease in revenue of yew tree was mainly
attributable to the Company s strategy adjustment to reserve more yew trees for future TCM raw materials sales. The decrease
in revenue of handicrafts was mainly attributable to the decrease in market demand and normal sales fluctuation. We did not have
wood ear mushroom sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the decrease in market demand and we are still exploring
on various customer bases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the  Others  segment includes the sales
of yew candles, pine needle extracts and dietary supplement named  Auri Essence  that the Company started to sell
in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. The increase in revenues of  Others  segment was mainly attributable to
the increases with sales of yew candles and pine needle extracts.  

Cost
of Revenues   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues amounted to $13,248,067 as compared to $3,578,043 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $9,670,024 or 270%. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues accounted
for 90% of total revenues compared to 72% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the Nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues amounted to $34,885,324 as compared to $7,036,132 for the Nine months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $27,849,192 or 396%. For the Nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of revenues accounted
for 89% of total revenues compared to 57% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cost
of revenues by product categories is as follows:  

The
increase in our cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was primarily a result of the increase in costs of revenue in TCM raw materials and the  Others 
segments and partially offset by decreasing in costs of revenue of wood ear mushroom segment.  

The
increase in cost of revenue in TCM raw material segment was primarily attributable to the increase in sales to our related party,
Yew Pharmaceutical. We started to sell some TCM raw materials processed from the whole yew trees upon to our customer demand requirement
from the third quarter of 2015 that eventually increased the unit cost of our TCM raw materials.  

The
decrease in cost of revenue in yew trees segment as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was mainly
due to the decreased sales of yew trees.  

The
increase in cost of revenue in handicrafts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the differences of sales product mix.  

We
did not have wood ear mushroom sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the decrease in market demand
and we are still exploring on various customer bases.  

The
 Others  segment includes the sales of yew candles, pine needle extract and dietary supplement categories. The increase
in cost of revenue in  Others  Segment as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily
attributable to the increased sales of yew candles and pine needle extract.  

Gross
Profit   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit was $1,419,032 as compared to $1,419,158 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, representing gross profit margins of 9.7% and 28.4%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross
profit was $4,462,254 as compared to $5,270,446 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing gross profit margins
of 11.3% and 42.8%, respectively. Gross profit margins by categories are as follows:  

The
decrease in our overall gross profit margin for the three and nine month ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the lower gross margin yields of TCM raw materials, Yew trees,
Handicrafts and  Others .  

The
decrease in our gross margin percentage related to the sale of TCM raw materials for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the sales of TCM raw
materials processed from the whole yew trees upon to our customer demand requirement starting from the third quarter of 2015 that
eventually decreased the gross profit margin of TCM raw materials for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
decrease in our gross margin percentage related to the sale of yew trees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company s strategy adjustment
to reserve more yew trees for future TCM raw materials sales.  

The
decrease in our gross margin percentage related to the sale of handicrafts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily attributable to the sales at costs for some handicrafts
and the differences of sales product mix.  

We
did not have wood ear mushroom sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the decrease in market demand
and we are still exploring on various customer bases.  

The
decrease in our gross margin percentage of  Others  segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 216
as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the sales of pine needle extract
that had a lower gross profit margin.  

Selling
Expenses    

Selling
expenses consisted of the following:   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling expense was $5,667 as compared to $10,013 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $4,346, or 43.40%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling expense was $17,754 as compared
to $23,776 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $6,022, or 25.33%.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses amounted to $293,850, as compared to $474,560 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $180,710, or 38.08%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general
and administrative expenses amounted to $938,920, as compared to $1,417,338 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of $478,418, or 33.75%.  

General
and administrative expenses consisted of the following:   

The
decrease in our general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the decrease in compensation and related benefits.  

The
changes in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of the following:   

Income
from Operations   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, income from operations was $1,119,515, as compared to income from operations of $934,585
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $184,930, or 19.79%. The increase was primarily attributable to
the increases in sales of revenue from TCM raw materials and  Others  segments.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income from operations was $3,505,580, as compared to income from operations of $3,829,332
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $323,752, or 8.45%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the
decreased gross profit in the first nine months of 2016.  

Other
Income (Expenses)   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total other expense was $38,977 as compared to total other income of $3,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total other expense was $68,435 as compared to total other income of $115,428 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Income   

As
a result of the factors described above, our net income was $1,080,538 or $0.02 (basic and diluted), for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to net income of $933,514 or $0.02 (basic and diluted), for the three months ended September 30,
2015. As a result of the factors described above, our net income was $3,437,145 or $0.07 (basic and diluted), for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net income of $3,897,560 or $0.07 (basic and diluted), for the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  

Foreign
Currency Translation Adjustment   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we reported an unrealized loss on foreign currency translation of $198,125, as compared
to a loss of $1,701,546 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported
an unrealized loss on foreign currency translation of $1,096,794, as compared to a loss of $1,319,999 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The change reflects the effect of the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the RMB. These gains and loss
are non-cash items. As described elsewhere herein, the functional currency of our subsidiary, JSJ, and our VIE, HDS, is the RMB.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated and presented in U.S. dollars using period end rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for net revenues, costs, and expenses. Net gains
resulting from foreign exchange transactions, if any, are included in the consolidated statements of income.  

Comprehensive
Income    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, comprehensive income of $882,413 was derived from the sum of our net income of $1,080,538
with foreign currency translation loss of $198,125. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, comprehensive loss of $768,032
was derived from the sum of our net income of $933,514 with foreign currency translation loss of $1,701,546.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, comprehensive income of $2,340,351 was derived from the sum of our net income of $3,437,145
with foreign currency translation loss of $1,096,794. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, comprehensive income of $2,577,561
was derived from the sum of our net income of $3,897,560 with foreign currency translation loss of $1,319,999.  

Segment
Information   

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we operated
in five reportable business segments: (1) the TCM raw materials segment, consisting of the production and sale of yew raw materials
and yew tree extracts used in the manufacture of TCM; (2) the yew tree segment, consisting of the growth and sale of yew tree
seedlings and mature trees; (3) the handicrafts segment, consisting of the manufacture and sale of furniture and handicrafts made
of yew timber; (4) the wood ear mushroom segment, consisting of the sale of wood ear mushroom; and (5) the  Others 
segment, consisting of the sales of yew candles, pine needle extracts and dietary supplement. Our reportable segments are strategic
business units that offer different products. The five business segments are managed separately based on the fundamental differences
in their operations. All of the Company s operations except the sales of dietary supplement named  Auri Essence 
are conducted in the PRC.  

Information
with respect to these reportable business segments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:  

Information
with respect to these reportable business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:  

TCM
raw materials   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 76,513 kg of TCM raw materials as compared to 11,074 kg of TCM raw materials
during the three months ended September 30, 2015, a 590.92% increase in sales volume primarily attributable to increase in sales
volume to our related party, Yew Pharmaceutical.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 113,713 kg of TCM raw materials as compared to 23,954 kg of TCM raw materials
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a 374.71% increase in sales volume primarily attributable to increase in sales
volume to our related party, Yew Pharmaceutical.  

In
February 2010, we began selling yew branches and leaves that are used in the production of TCM. On January 9, 2010, we entered
into the Development Agreement with Yew Pharmaceutical, a related party, for the development, production and sale of yew-based
TCM. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, we sell yew branches and leaves to Yew Pharmaceutical. Yew Pharmaceutical manufactures
TCM at its own facilities in Harbin in accordance with the requirements of the Heilongjiang Food and Drug Administration (the
 HFDA ). Yew Pharmaceutical is also responsible for producing the finished product in accordance with GMP requirements.
In this regard, Yew Pharmaceutical received a GMP certificate in November 2009, and has filed all applications with, and obtained
all approvals from, the HFDA.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had revenue of $6,873,988 and $2,845,904, respectively, from the sale of
TCM raw materials to Yew Pharmaceutical. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from the sale of TCM
raw materials to third parties amounted to $nil.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had revenue of $24,063,798 and $5,411,014, respectively, from the sale of
TCM raw materials to Yew Pharmaceutical. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from the sale of TCM raw
materials to third parties amounted to $nil and $2,301,210, respectively.  

Zi
Shan  is marketed and sold exclusively through Yew Pharmaceutical, under the Development Agreement. Yew Pharmaceutical
is a major purchaser of our yew raw materials used in the production of TCM and is owned directly and indirectly primarily by
Mr. Wang and Madame Qi.  

Sales
volume was summarized as follows:  

Additionally,
in order to ensure the sustainability of our yew forests, we closely monitor the growth rate of our yew trees. The amount of TCM
raw materials we can sell is limited by the seasonal growth rate of our yew trees that are available for cutting branches and
leaves. Over time, as more yew trees reach maturity, these limits may be increased.  

Yew
trees   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold approximately 4,860 pieces of yew seedlings and trees, as compared to approximately
6,000 pieces of yew seedlings and trees for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease in volume of 19%.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold approximately 4,860 pieces of yew seedlings and trees, as compared to approximately
60,000 pieces of yew seedlings and trees for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease in volume of 91.9%.  

The
decrease in revenue of yew tree for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly attributable to the company s
strategy adjustment to reserve more yew trees for future TCM raw materials sales as compared to the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  

In connection with our entering into a land use agreement in July 2012 (the  Fuye Field Agreement ),
we acquired more than 80,000 trees   which are not yew trees   located on that property. These trees consist of approximately
20,000 larix, 56,700 spruce and 3,700 poplar trees. Larix trees are used primarily in landscaping and we began selling larix trees
to customers during 2013. Spruce and poplar trees are used primarily as building materials. Since March 31, 2014, we began to
sell spruce trees to customers and anticipate selling poplar trees in the next few years once these trees reach their maturities. 

Handicrafts   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from the sale of handicrafts made from yew timber amounted to $1,087
and $15,417, respectively, decrease of $14,330, or 92.9%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from
the sale of handicrafts made from yew timber amounted to $97,560 and $110,131, respectively, decrease of $12,571, or 11.41%. The
decrease in revenues of handicrafts was mainly due to the decrease in market demand and normal sales fluctuation.  

We
continued to evaluate the effectiveness and design of our selling efforts in the handicraft segment which had included establishing
the appropriate sales volume goals with our distributors to reach our desired sales volume of handicrafts.  

Wood
ear mushroom   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not make the sales of wood ear mushroom. As this is a newly introduced
product category commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014, we are still seeking for various customer resources for this segment.  

Others   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold approximately 22,008 yew candles, 3,600 kilograms pine needle extracts and
385 bottles of  Auri Essence  in amount of $8,142,621 to third party. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we sold approximately 30,408 yew candles, 6,960 kilograms pine needle extracts and 425 bottles of  Auri Essence  in
amount of $14,955,422 to third party.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash balances of $1,260,081 and $985,119, respectively.
These funds are primarily located in various financial institutions located in China. Our primary uses of cash have been for the
purchase of yew trees, land use rights and yew forest assets. Additionally, we use cash for employee compensation and working
capital.  

The
following table sets forth information as to the principal changes in the components of our working capital from December 31,
2015 to September 30, 2016:  

Our
working capital increased by $9,532,435 to $21,759,167 at September 30, 2016, from working capital of $12,226,732 at December
31, 2015. This increase in working capital is primarily attributable to:  

partially
offset by:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $361,987, as compared to net cash
flow used in operating activities of $1,207,208 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,569,195. Because
the exchange rate conversion is different for the balance sheet and the statements of cash flows, the changes in assets and liabilities
reflected on the statements of cash flows are not necessarily identical with the comparable changes reflected on the balance sheets.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flow provided by operating activities of $361,986 was primarily attributable
to:  

net
    income of approximately $3,437,145 adjusted for the add-back of non-cash items, such as depreciation of approximately $89,000
    and amortization of land use rights and yew forest assets of approximately $8,784,000, stock-based compensation of approximately
    $245,000; and   

the
    receipt of cash from operations from changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as a decrease in accounts receivable
      related party of approximately $2,806,000;   

partially
offset by:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash flow used in operating activities was $1,207,208, as compared to net cash flow
provided by operating activities of $3,495,168 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $4,702,376. Because
the exchange rate conversion is different for the balance sheet and the statements of cash flows, the changes in assets and liabilities
reflected on the statements of cash flows are not necessarily identical with the comparable changes reflected on the balance sheets.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash flow used in operating activities of $1,207,208 was primarily attributable
to:  

net
    income of approximately $3,897,560 adjusted for the add-back of non-cash items, such as depreciation of approximately $113,000
    and amortization of land use rights and yew forest assets of approximately $1,109,000, stock-based compensation of approximately
    $800,000, and issuance of common stock for professional service of approximately $3,000; and   

the
    receipt of cash from operations from changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as a decrease in accounts receivable
      related party of approximately $340,000;   

partially
offset by:  

the
    use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as an increase in accounts receivable of approximately
    $784,000, an increase in VAT recoverables of approximately $1,106,000, and an increase in inventories of approximately $5,191,000.   

Net
cash flow used in investing activities was approximately $7,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we have made payment in approximately $7,000 for purchase of property and equipment. Net cash
flow used in investing activities was approximately $1,370,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we have made payment in approximately $1,362,000 for land use right and yew forest assets.   

Net
cash flow used in financing activities was approximately $48,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and consisted of
proceeds of approximately $181 from a related party and repayments of approximately $49,000 to our related party. Net cash flow
provided by financing activities was approximately $2,295,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and consisted of proceeds
of approximately $1,642,000 from bank loan and approximately $658,000 from our related parties.  

We
have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, bank loans and advances
from related parties. From March 2008 to September 2009, we received approximately $2.9 million of proceeds in the aggregate from
offerings and sales of our common stock. Except for the portion used to pay for professional and other expenses in the U.S., substantial
portions of the proceeds we received through sales of our common stock were retained in the PRC and used to fund our working capital
requirements. As the PRC government imposes controls on PRC companies  ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies and
the remittance of currency out of China, from time to time, in order to fund our corporate activities in the U.S., Zhiguo Wang,
our President and CEO, advanced funds to us in the U.S. and we repaid the amounts owed to him in RMB in the PRC.  

It
is management s intention to expand our operations as quickly as reasonably practicable to capitalize on the demand opportunity
for our products. We regularly review our cash funding requirements and attempt to meet those requirements through a combination
of cash on hand, cash provided by operations and any potential available bank borrowings. We believe that we can continue meeting
our cash funding requirements for our business in this manner over at least the next twelve months. The majority of our funds
are maintained in RMB in bank accounts in China. We receive most of our revenue in the PRC. Under existing PRC foreign exchange
regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade
related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from
China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) or its local counterparts is required where RMB is
to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated
in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access to foreign currencies for current account
transactions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $40.8 million and $41.8 million, respectively, of
our net assets are located in the PRC. If the foreign exchange control system in the PRC prevents us from obtaining sufficient
foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to transfer funds deposited within the PRC to fund working
capital requirements in the U.S. or pay any dividends in currencies other than the RMB, to our shareholders.  

Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have certain potential commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions,
changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty
regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our
determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  

The
following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016, and the effect these obligations are expected
to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder s equity
or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do
not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support
to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.  

ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rates Risk   

Substantially
most of our operating revenues and expenses are denominated in RMB. We operate using RMB and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations
are largely mitigated because local expenses in the PRC are also denominated in the same currency. We do not believe that we currently
have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other
derivative financial instruments. Because we generally receive cash flows denominated in RMB, our exposure to foreign exchange
risks should be limited.  

Our
assets and liabilities, of which the functional currency is the RMB, are translated into USD using the exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet date, resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected as cumulative translation adjustment in the
shareholders  equity section on our consolidated balance sheets. A portion of our net assets are impacted by changes in
foreign currencies translation rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. We recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $1,096,794
and of $1,319,999 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, to reflect the impact of
the fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.  

The
value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in
China s political and economic conditions. The conversion of the RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, has
been based on rates set by the People s Bank of China.  

To
the extent that we decide to convert RMB denominated cash amounts into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making any dividend payments,
which we have not declared but may declare in the future, or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. Conversely, if we need to convert U.S. dollars
into RMB for operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount it received
from the conversion. We have not used, and do not currently expect to use in the future, any forward contracts or currency borrowings
to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.  

Interest
Rate Risk   

We
have not been, nor do we currently anticipate being, exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates.  

ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   

The
Company s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.
