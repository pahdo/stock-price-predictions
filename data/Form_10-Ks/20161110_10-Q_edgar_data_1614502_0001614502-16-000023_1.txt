Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expects,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   project,   should,   will  and  would  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may be required under applicable law.   
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    We have no operating history and our total assets consist primarily of the investments by Resource Innovation Office Advisor, LLC (our "Advisor") and Resource America, Inc. Because we have not identified any additional real estate assets to acquire with proceeds from our initial public offering, we are considered a blind pool, and our stockholders will not have an opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them, making an investment in us more speculative. 
                
    We are dependent on our Advisor to select investments and conduct our operations. Our Advisor has no prior operating history and no prior experience operating a public company.  This inexperience makes our future performance difficult to predict. 
                
    Our executive officers and some of our directors are also officers, directors, managers or key professionals of our Advisor, Resource Securities, Inc. (our "Dealer Manager") and other entities affiliated with Resource Real Estate, Inc. (our "Sponsor").  As a result, these individuals will face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other programs sponsored by our Sponsor and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs.  These conflicts could result in action or inaction that is not in the best interests of our stockholders. 
                
    We will pay substantial fees to and expenses of our Advisor, its affiliates and participating broker-dealers, which payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment. 
                
    Our Advisor and its affiliates will receive fees in connection with transactions involving the acquisition and management of our investments.  These fees will be based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us.  This may influence our Advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us. 
                
    There is no limit on the amount we can borrow to acquire a single real estate investment, but pursuant to our charter, we may not leverage our assets with debt financing such that our borrowings would be in excess of 300% of our net assets unless a majority of our independent directors find substantial justification for borrowing a greater amount.  
                
    We may lack property diversification if we do not raise substantially more than the minimum offering in our initial public offering. 
                
    Our charter permits us to pay distributions from any source without limitation, including from offering proceeds, borrowings, sales of assets or waivers or deferrals of fees otherwise owed to our Advisor.  To the extent these distributions exceed our net income or net capital gain, a greater proportion of your distributions will generally represent a return of capital as opposed to current income or gain, as applicable.   
                
    We may experience adverse business developments or conditions similar to those affecting certain programs sponsored by our Sponsor, which could limit our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of an investment in us.   
                
    Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes would reduce the amount of income we have available for distribution and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks described above and identified in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS 
  Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc. (the  Company ) was organized in Maryland on   June 25, 2014  .  The Company is offering up to   $1.1 billion   of shares of its common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   of shares in its primary offering in any combination of Class A and Class T shares and up to   $100.0 million   of shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") in any combination of Class A and Class T shares. The initial offering price for shares in the primary offering is   $10.00   per share for Class A and   $9.47   per share for Class T. The initial offering price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.60   per share for Class A and   $9.09   per share for Class T. The Company will determine its net asset value ("NAV") no later than July 12, 2018 (the "NAV pricing date"), which is two years and 150 days after the Company broke escrow in its initial public offering. Commencing on the NAV pricing date, if the primary offering is ongoing, the Company will offer Class A and Class T shares in the primary offering at a price equal to its NAV per share for Class A and Class T shares, respectively, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and pursuant to the DRIP at a price equal to   96%   of the new primary offering price. If the Company s primary offering is not ongoing on the NAV pricing date, or on the date of any subsequent NAV pricing, it will offer Class A and Class T shares pursuant to the DRIP at a price equal to   96%   of the most recently determined NAV per share for Class A and Class T shares respectively. The Company will update its NAV at least annually following the NAV pricing date and further adjust the per share price in the primary offering and DRIP accordingly.  
  The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company and has adopted a fiscal year ending December 31. Resource Innovation Office Advisor, LLC (the "Advisor"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ( RAI ) contributed   $200,000   to the Company in exchange for   14,815   shares of common stock on   July 30, 2014  . On December 30, 2014, the Company paid a stock dividend of one-half of a share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock. In April 2015, Resource Innovation Office SLP, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Advisor, contributed   $5,000   to Resource Innovation Office OP, LP, the Company's operating partnership (the "OP"), in exchange for   500   special operating partnership units. These interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as Noncontrolling interests.  On September 29, 2015, the Company converted all outstanding shares of its common stock to Class A shares. On   February 16, 2016  , RAI contributed   $2.0 million   in exchange for   222,227   shares of Class A common stock. 
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III Capital Partners, LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities.  C-III controls our Advisor, Resource Securities, Inc., ( Resource Securities ) the Company's dealer manager, and Resource Innovation Office Manager, LLC, the Company's property manager;  C-III also controls all of the shares formerly held by RAI. 
  On   February 16, 2016  , the Company satisfied the   $2.0 million   minimum offering amount for its initial public offering, excluding shares purchased by residents of Pennsylvania, New York and Washington. As a result, the Company has broken escrow and issued shares of common stock in the offering. Subscription payments received from residents of Pennsylvania and Washington will continue to be held in escrow until the Company has received aggregate subscriptions of at least   $50.0 million   and   $10.0 million  , respectively. Having raised the minimum offering, the offering proceeds were released by the escrow agent to the Company and were available for the acquisition of properties and other purposes disclosed in our prospectus dated   March 23, 2016   as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
  The Company expects that its portfolio will consist primarily of office buildings that are located in U.S. cities that attract a young, creative and educated labor force and provide a collaborative office environment to companies competing for talented employees. The Company also expects that, to a lesser extent, its portfolio will consist of real estate debt which is secured by office buildings having the same characteristics. The Company does not expect that debt investments will comprise more than   25%   of its portfolio, following the investment of all of the net proceeds from its primary offering. The Company cannot predict, however, the actual allocation of net proceeds from its offering between property acquisitions and debt investments at this time because this allocation will depend, in part, on market conditions and investment opportunities and on the amount of financing that the Company is able to obtain with respect to the types of assets in which it seeks to invest.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has contracted to purchase its first commercial real estate asset.  
  The Company intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. As such, to maintain its REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute at least 90% of its net income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders as well as comply with certain

other requirements. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent that it annually distributes all of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. The Company also intends to operate its business in a manner that will permit it to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.    
  The consolidated financial statements and the information and tables contained in the notes thereto as of   September 30, 2016  , are unaudited.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP. 
  Development Stage Company  
  The Company has limited operations and is considered to be in the development stage.  
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as follows:                                      
                 Subsidiaries 
      Resource Innovation Office Holdings, LLC 
      Resource Innovation Office OP, LP 

All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
  Earnings per Share 
    Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders for each period by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period for each share class. Diluted earnings per share take into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted to common stock.  For the purposes of calculating earnings per share, all common shares and per share information in the financial statements have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of any stock distributions and stock splits. 
  Use of Estimates 
    The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Noncontrolling interests 
    A noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.  A noncontrolling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statement of operations.  An allocation to a noncontrolling interest may differ from the stated ownership

percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described by such governing documents.  
  Real Estate Investments 
  The Company will record acquired real estate at fair value on its respective acquisition date. The Company will consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life.  The Company estimates that the useful lives of its assets by class will be as follows: 
                 Buildings 
    25-40 years 
      Building improvements 
    10-25 years 
      Tenant improvements 
    Shorter of lease term or expected useful life of the related building 
      Lease intangibles 
    Remaining term of related lease 

Impairment of Long Lived Assets 
    When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company will review the asset for impairment.  This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition. 
  These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.  
  If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. 
  Loans Held for Investment 
  The real estate loans receivable will be recorded at cost and reviewed for potential impairment at each balance sheet date.  A loan receivable is considered impaired when it becomes probable, based on current information, that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms.  The amount of impairment, if any, is measured by comparing the recorded amount of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows or the fair value of the collateral.  If a loan is deemed to be impaired, the Company will record a reserve for loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall.  Failure to recognize impairment would result in the overstatement of the carrying values of the Company s real estate loans receivable and an overstatement of the Company s net income. 
  The Company may acquire real estate loans at a discount due to credit quality.  Revenues from these loans are recorded under the effective interest method.  Under this method an effective interest rate ( EIR ) is applied to the cost basis of the real estate loan receivable.  The EIR that is calculated when the real estate loan receivable is acquired remains constant and is the basis for subsequent impairment testing and income recognition.  If the amount and timing of future cash collections are not reasonably estimable, the Company accounts for the real estate receivable on the cost recovery method.  Under the cost recovery method of accounting, no income is recognized until the basis of the real estate loan receivable has been fully recovered.  
  Interest income from loans receivable will be recognized based on the contractual terms of the debt instrument.  Fees related to any buydown of the interest rate will be deferred as prepaid interest income and amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income.  Closing costs related to the purchase of a loan receivable will be amortized over the term of the loan and accreted as an adjustment against interest income. 
  Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, it is the Company s policy to allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building, fixtures and improvements, and identified intangible lease assets and liabilities,  
  
   10

  (unaudited) 

consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, as applicable, other value of in-place leases and value of tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values. 
  The Company will record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.  The Company will amortize any capitalized above-market or below-market lease values as an increase or reduction to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, which the Company expects will range from   one month   to   ten years  . 
  The Company will measure the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant.  Management s estimates of value are expected to be made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors to be considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. 
  The Company will also consider information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  In estimating carrying costs, management will also include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods. Management will also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs have not already been incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. 
  The total amount of other intangible assets acquired will be further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall relationship with that respective tenant.  Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the Company s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. 
  The Company will amortize the value of in-place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases.  The value of customer relationship intangibles will be amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event will the amortization periods for the intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense in that period.   
  The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to current market rental rates, discount rates and other variables.  The use of inappropriate estimates would result in an incorrect assessment of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, which could impact the amount of the Company s reported net income.  These estimates are subject to change until all information is finalized, which is generally within one year of the acquisition date.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company will recognize minimum rent, including rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and will include amounts expected to be received in later years in deferred rents.  The Company will record property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred. 
  The Company will make estimates of the collectability of its tenant receivables related to base rents, including straight-line rentals, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income.  The Company will specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, the Company will make estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable.  In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year.  These estimates have a direct impact on the Company s net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income.

Income Taxes 
  The Company intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT, commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Accordingly, the Company will generally not be subject to corporate U.S. federal or state income tax to the extent that it makes qualifying distributions to its stockholders, and provided it satisfies on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, the REIT requirements including certain asset, income, distribution and stock ownership tests. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, it will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which it lost its REIT qualification. Accordingly, the Company s failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders. 
  The dividends paid deduction of a REIT for qualifying dividends to its stockholders is computed using the Company s taxable income as opposed to net income reported on the financial statements. Taxable income, generally, will differ from net income reported on the financial statements because the determination of taxable income is based on tax provisions and not financial accounting principles.   
  The Company may elect to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that the Company cannot hold or engage in directly, and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business.  A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. 
  While a TRS may generate net income, a TRS can declare dividends to the Company which will be included in the Company s taxable income and necessitate a distribution to its stockholders. Conversely, if the Company retains earnings at a TRS level, no distribution is required and the Company can increase book equity of the consolidated entity.  
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  The Company incurs organizational, accounting, and offering costs in pursuit of its financing. Organization and offering costs of the Company are initially being paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company. Organization costs are expensed as incurred and include all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the formation of the Company, including but not limited to legal fees and other costs to incorporate the Company.  
  Pursuant to the advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor (the "Advisory Agreement"), the Company will be obligated to reimburse the Advisor for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, and organization and offering costs paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company, up to an amount equal to   15%   of gross offering proceeds.   
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has charged   $406,506   to equity for the payment of offering costs consisting of accounting, advertising, allocated payroll, due diligence, marketing, legal, printing and similar costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor has advanced   $4.4 million   of these costs on behalf of the Company, of which   $4.0 million   has been deferred as of    September 30, 2016  .  A portion of deferred offering costs will be charged to equity upon the sale of each share of common stock sold under the public offering. Such costs will only become a liability of the Advisor to the extent that selling commissions, dealer manager fees and organization and offering costs incurred by the Company exceed   15%   of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering. If, however, the Company raises the maximum offering amount in the primary offering and under the DRIP, organization and offering expenses (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) are estimated to be approximately   1.0%   of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering. When recorded by the Company, organization costs are expensed as incurred, which include all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the formation of the Company, including but not limited to legal fees and other costs to incorporate the Company.  There can be no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital will be successful.

Outstanding Class T shares issued in the Company's primary offering are subject to a   1%   annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee for   five   years from the date on which such share is issued. The Company will cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee on each Class T share prior to the fifth anniversary of its issuance on the earliest of the following, should any of these events occur: (i) the date at which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources equals   10%   of the gross proceeds from the Company's primary offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our DRIP); (ii) the date on which the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange; and (iii) the date of a merger or other extraordinary transaction in which the Company is a party and in which the  common stock is exchanged for cash or other securities. The Company cannot predict if or when any of these events will occur.  For issued Class T shares, the Company has accrued an estimate of the total distribution and shareholder servicing fee for the full   five   year period at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items". The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU No. 2015-01 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis", which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. ASU No. 2015-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments", which eliminates the requirement to retroactively revise comparative financial information for prior periods presented in financial statements due to changes in provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in subsequent periods.  Upon adoption, disclosure of the amounts recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date are required.    ASU No. 2015-16 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
   Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective 
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." Under the new guidance, an entity should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability

to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases", which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions and requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments", which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  The guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated cash flows.     

NOTE 3   SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 

NOTE 4   ACQUISITION 
  On September 13, 2016, the Company, through its operating partnership, entered into an agreement to purchase a commercial property located in Chicago, Illinois (the  Sunnyside Property ) from an unaffiliated seller. The Sunnyside Property is a three-story commercial building with   four   loft office units located on the two upper floors and   two   retail units at street level. The purchase price for the Sunnyside Property is   $7,250,000  , excluding closing costs.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company deposited   $250,000   of earnest money towards the purchase.  On October 18, 2016, the Company deposited an additional   $150,000   towards the purchase in order to extend the closing timeframe.  The Company will be obligated to purchase the Sunnyside Property only after satisfaction of agreed upon closing conditions. The Company intends to fund the purchase of the Sunnyside Property with proceeds from its ongoing initial public offering and debt proceeds.  The purchase is expected to be completed in November 2016.  There can be no assurance that the Company will complete the acquisition on the terms described above or at all. In some circumstances, if the Company fails to complete the acquisition, the Company may forfeit up to   $400,000   of earnest money.

NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    The Company is externally managed and advised by the Advisor. Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor provides the Company with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel.  The Advisor will be reimbursed for the Company s allocable share of costs for Advisor personnel, including allocable personnel salaries, benefits and overhead after the Company has broken escrow.  Each of the Company s officers is an employee of the Sponsor, which is the Advisor's parent company, the Company's sponsor  and a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAI, or one of its affiliates.  The Company does not expect to have any employees.  The Advisor, or its employees, are not obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to the Company s business.  The Advisor and any employees of Resource Real Estate, Inc. acting on behalf of the Advisor are at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of the Company s board of directors and has only such functions and authority as the Company delegates to it. 
  During the course of the offering, the Advisor will provide offering-related services to the Company and will advance funds to the Company for both operating costs and organization and offering costs.  These amounts will be reimbursed to the Advisor from the proceeds of the offering although there can be no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital will be successful. 
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 22, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of C III merged with and into RAI, with RAI surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of C-III.  
  Relationship with the Advisor 
  The Advisory Agreement has a   one  -year term and renews for an unlimited number of successive   one year   terms upon the approval of the conflicts committee of the Company's Board of Directors.   On September 23, 2016, the Board of Directors, voted to renew the Advisory Agreement, effective October 2, 2016. The Advisory Agreement was renewed for a   one  -year term ending October 1, 2017 with terms identical to those in effect through October 1, 2016.  Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor will receive fees and will be reimbursed for its expenses as set forth below: 
    Acquisition fees.

    Asset management fees.   The Advisor will earn a monthly asset management fee equal to   0.083%   (one-twelfth of 1%) of the cost of each asset at the end of each month, without deduction for depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves. The asset management fee is based only on the portion of the costs or value attributable to the Company s investment in an asset if the Company does not own all of an asset and does not manage or control the asset. 
    Disposition fees.   The Advisor will earn a disposition fee in connection with the sale of a property equal to the lesser of one-half of the aggregate brokerage commission paid, or if none is paid,   2.0%   of the contract sales price.  
    Debt financing fees.   The Advisor will earn a debt financing fee equal to   0.5%   of the amount available under any debt financing obtained for which it provided substantial services. 
  Expense reimbursements.   The Company also will pay directly or reimburse the Advisor for all of the expenses paid or incurred by the Advisor or its affiliates on behalf of the Company or in connection with the services provided to the Company in relation to its public offering, including its DRIP.  This includes all organization and offering costs of up to   15.0%   of gross offering proceeds. Reimbursements also include expenses the Advisor incurs in connection with providing services to the Company, including the Company s allocable share of costs for Advisor personnel and overhead, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the selection and acquisition of properties or other real estate related debt investments, whether or not the Company ultimately acquires the investment.  However, the Company will not reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor earns acquisition or disposition fees.

Relationship with Resource Innovation Office Manager, LLC 
  Resource Innovation Office Manager, LLC (the  Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, will manage real estate properties and real estate-related debt investments and will coordinate the leasing of and will manage construction activities related to the Company s real estate property pursuant to the terms of the management agreement with the Manager. 
    Property management fees.   The Manager will earn a property management fee expected to range from   2.5%   to   4.0%   of actual gross cash receipts from the operations of real property investments that it manages and a   1.0%   oversight fee on any real property investments that are managed by third parties. 
    Construction management fees  . The Manager will earn a construction management fee expected to range from   3.0%   to   5.0%   of actual aggregate costs to construct improvements, or to repair, rehab or reconstruct a property.  
    Debt servicing fees  . The Manager will earn a debt servicing fee equal to   0.5%   on payments received from loans held by the Company for investment.  
    Expense reimbursement  . During the ordinary course of business, the Manager or other affiliates of RAI may pay certain shared operating expenses on behalf of the Company. 
  Relationship with Resource Securities 
  Resource Securities, an affiliate of the Advisor, serves as the Company s dealer manager and is responsible for marketing the Company s shares during the public offering. Pursuant to the terms of the dealer manager agreement with the Dealer Manager, the Company pays the Dealer Manager a selling commission of up to   7.0%   of gross primary offering proceeds from the sale of Class A shares and up to   2.0%   of gross primary offering proceeds from the sale Class T shares and a dealer manager fee of up to   3.0%   of gross primary offering proceeds from the sale of Class A and Class T shares. The Dealer Manager reallows all selling commissions earned and a portion of the dealer manager fee as a marketing fee to participating broker-dealers. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees are earned by the Dealer Manager in connection with sales under the DRIP. Additionally, the Company may reimburse the Dealer Manager for bona fide due diligence expenses. 
  Resource Securities will be paid an annual fee of   1.0%   of the purchase price (or, once reported, the NAV) per share of Class T common stock sold in the primary offering for   five   years from the date on which each share is issued up to a total of   5.0%  . 
  The differences between the Class A and Class T shares relate to the fees and selling commissions payable with respect to each class and the differing distribution amounts and expense allocations due to differing ongoing fees and expenses. The per share amount of distributions on Class T shares will likely be lower than the distributions on the Class A shares for so long as the distribution and shareholder servicing fee applies because this fee is a class-specific expense. The following table summarizes the differences in fees and selling commissions between the classes of common stock: 

(1) 
    Each outstanding Class T share issued in the primary offering is subject to an annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee for   five   years from the date on which such share is issued. The Company will cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee on each Class T share prior to the fifth anniversary of its issuance on the earliest of the following, should any of these events occur: (i) the date at which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources equals   10%   of the gross proceeds from the Company's primary offering (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our DRIP); (ii) the date on which the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange; and (iii) the date of a merger or other extraordinary transaction in which the Company is a party and in which the  common stock is exchanged for cash or other securities. The Company cannot predict if or when any of these events will occur.  
          
  In the case of a Class T share purchased in the primary offering at a price equal to   $9.47  , the maximum distribution and shareholder servicing fee that may be accrued on that Class T share will equal   $0.47  . However, because the Company will only

completely cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee on the earliest of the dates described above, such fee will accrue on all outstanding Class T shares that were purchased in the primary offering within the previous   five years   of such date. The expense of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee payable with respect to Class T shares sold in the primary offering will be allocated among all outstanding Class T shares, including those sold under the DRIP and those sold in the primary offering more than   five years   ago on which the Company has ceased paying distribution and shareholder servicing fees. As a result, holders of Class T shares purchased earlier in the offering will bear a greater expense from distribution and shareholder servicing fees than those holders of Class T shares purchased later in the offering.  
  Relationship with Resource Innovation Office SLP, LLC 
    Resource Innovation Office, SLP, LLC ("Resource Innovation Office SLP"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Advisor, holds special OP units in the Company's operating partnership and is entitled to receive   15.0%   of distributions from net sales proceeds after the Company's stockholders have received, in the aggregate, cumulative distributions equal to their total invested capital plus a   6.0%   cumulative, non-compounded annual pre-tax return on such aggregate invested capital. In addition, the special OP units will be redeemed upon the listing of the Company's common stock on a national securities exchange or the termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement.

  On February 9, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the  Amended Articles ) with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, which provided that every   1.0778   shares of common stock which were issued and outstanding prior to the acceptance of the Amended Articles shall be changed into one issued and outstanding Class A share. The Amended Articles took effect immediately upon filing with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland and the shares were updated retroactively to the date of issuance. 
  On March 23, 2016, the Company amended the primary offering price of Class A and Class T shares. The Company authorized a stock distribution of   0.0778   shares of common stock for outstanding shares of common stock purchased at the previous offering price. The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the stock distribution for all periods presented.  
  Special OP Units

In addition, the special OP units will be redeemed upon the listing of the Company's common stock on a national securities exchange or the termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc. and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Resource Innovation Office OP, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and to their subsidiaries. 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expects,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   project,   should,   will  and  would  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may be required under applicable law.   
  Overview 
  Resource Innovation Office REIT, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that intends to invest in office properties that are located in U.S. cities that attract a young, creative and educated labor pool. Examples of our targeted markets include, but are not limited to, major gateway cities such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston and Washington, D.C. as well as midsized cities such as Austin, Seattle and Denver. Within these types of cities, we seek to acquire office buildings that provide a collaborative office space environment to companies competing for talented employees. When needed, we intend to renovate and upgrade the properties we acquire to better serve and appeal to these types of tenants. To a lesser extent, we will also seek to originate and purchase commercial real estate debt secured by office buildings of this type. We do not expect that debt investments will comprise more than 25% of our portfolio, following the investment of all of the net proceeds from this offering. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate allocation of net proceeds from this offering between property acquisitions and debt investments at this time because this allocation will depend, in part, on market conditions and opportunities and on the amount of financing that we are able to obtain with respect to the types of assets in which we seek to invest. If we are only able to raise the minimum offering or an amount substantially less than our maximum offering, our plan of operation will be scaled down considerably, and we would expect to acquire a limited number of assets. We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forego a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. Thus, to the extent that Resource Innovation Office Advisor, LLC (our "Advisor") presents us with attractive investment opportunities that allow us to meet the real estate investment trust ("REIT") requirements under the Internal Revenue Code, our portfolio composition may vary from what we initially expect.  
  On September 8, 2016, Resource America, Inc., or RAI, the indirect parent of our Advisor, was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ( C-III ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 22, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of C III merged with and into RAI, with RAI surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of C-III.     
  On September 13, 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase a commercial property located in Chicago, Illinois, the Sunnyside Property, from an unaffiliated seller. The Sunnyside Property is a three-story commercial building with   four   loft office units located on the two upper floors and   two   retail units at street level. The purchase price for the Sunnyside Property is   $7,250,000  , excluding closing costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we deposited $250,000 of earnest money towards the purchase.   
  On October 18, 2016, we deposited an additional $150,000 towards the purchase of the Sunnyside Property in order to extend the closing timeframe. We will be obligated to purchase the Sunnyside Property only after satisfaction of agreed upon closing conditions. We intend to fund the purchase of the Sunnyside Property with proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering and debt proceeds. There can be no assurance that we will complete the acquisition on the terms described above or at all. In some circumstances, if we fail to complete the acquisition, we may forfeit up to $400,000 of earnest money.  The sale is expected to be completed in November 2016.

Results of Operations 
  On February 16, 2016, RAI purchased   222,227   shares of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of $9.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $2.0 million  .  As a result, we have raised the minimum offering amount of   $2.0 million   for our initial public offering, broken escrow and issued shares of common stock in the offering. As of the date of this filing, we are still in our organizational stage and have not commenced any significant operations. As we have not acquired any properties or other assets, our management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting our targeted portfolio, the U.S. office building industry, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of our assets. 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred the following general and administrative expenses: 

There were no similar expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we had not yet sold shares in our public offering.   
  In addition, we incurred   $33,244   of acquisition costs during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the our first expected acquisition, the Sunnyside Property.   
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We are offering and selling to the public in our public offering up to   $1.1 billion   in shares of common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   of shares in our primary offering in any combination of Class A and Class T shares and up to   $100.0 million   of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") in any combination of Class A and Class T shares. The initial offering price for Class A shares in the primary offering is   $10.00   per share and the initial offering price for Class T shares in the primary offering is   $9.47   per share. The initial offering price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.60   per share for Class A shares and   $9.09   per share for Class T shares. 
  We anticipate deriving the capital required to purchase real estate investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of our initial public offering and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and from proceeds from the sale of assets. In addition, our Advisor has and will advance funds to us for certain organization and offering costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have entered into a contract to purchase one commercial property which we intend to acquire using proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering and debt proceeds.  
  If we are unable to raise substantially more funds in the offering than the minimum offering amount, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. Further, we will have certain fixed operating costs, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in our offering. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions.

We intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investment in one or more properties, debt investments or other assets we may hold. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access additional funds when we need them or upon acceptable terms. 
  We currently have no outstanding debt. Although there is no limit on the amount we can borrow to acquire a single real estate investment, we may not leverage our assets with debt financing such that our borrowings are in excess of 300% of our net assets unless a majority of our independent directors find substantial justification for borrowing a greater amount. Examples of such a substantial justification include, without limitation, obtaining funds for the following: (i) to repay existing obligations, (ii) to pay sufficient distributions to maintain REIT status, or (iii) to buy an asset where an exceptional acquisition opportunity presents itself and the terms of the debt agreement and the nature of the asset are such that the debt does not increase the risk that we would become unable to meet our financial obligations as they became due. On a total portfolio basis, however, based on current lending market conditions, we anticipate that we will not leverage our assets with debt financing such that our total liabilities are in excess of 50% of our assets. 
  We may finance the acquisition costs of individual real estate investments, as well as the acquisition costs of all or a group of real estate investments acquired by us, by causing our subsidiaries to borrow directly from third-party financial institutions or other commercial lenders. Under these circumstances, our Advisor anticipates that certain properties acquired will serve as collateral for the debt we incur to acquire those particular properties and that we will seek to obtain nonrecourse financing for the acquisition of the properties. However, there is no guarantee that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining financing arrangements on a property-by-property basis and that the loans would be nonrecourse to us. Additionally, we may obtain corporate-level financing through a line of credit from third-party financial institutions or other commercial lenders. Our assets will serve as collateral for this type of debt incurred to acquire real estate investments. We may also obtain seller financing with respect to specific assets that we acquire. 
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make payments to our Advisor and the dealer manager of our public offering, which is an affiliate of our Advisor. During our organization and offering stage, these payments will include payments to the dealer manager for selling commissions and the dealer manager fee and payments to the dealer manager and our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering expenses. However, our Advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering expenses incurred by us exceed 15% of our gross offering proceeds. During our acquisition and development stage, we expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of real estate investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us.  
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    For a discussion on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the discussion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 under "Item 7.

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We had no significant operations as of   September 30, 2016  .  When we commence significant operations, we expect to be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of incurring long-term debt to acquire properties and other investments. We intend to manage our interest rate risk with the objectives of limiting the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows and lowering overall borrowing costs. We expect that we may enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and rate lock arrangements, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. 
   
  ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
          There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  From time to time, we may become party to legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities. 
    
  ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
    
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2016. 
   
  ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  During the period covered by this report we did not sell any unregistered securities. 
  Use of Proceeds 
  On   June 10, 2015  , our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-201842), covering our initial public offering of up to   $1.1 billion   in shares of common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   of shares in our primary offering and up to   $100.0 million   of shares of common stock under our DRIP, was declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933. We retained Resource Securities, an affiliate of our Advisor, as the dealer manager for our offering.  
  We are offering up to   $1.1 billion   of shares of our common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   of shares in our primary offering in any combination of Class A and Class T shares and up to   $100.0 million   of shares pursuant to our DRIP in any combination of Class A and Class T shares. The initial offering price for Class A shares in the primary offering is   $10.00   per share and the initial offering price of Class T shares in the primary offering is   $9.47   per share. The initial offering price for Class A shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.60   per share and the initial offering price for Class T shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.09   per share.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our Advisor has incurred offering costs on our behalf of approximately   $4.4 million  .  
  From the commencement of our offering through   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $50,814   in selling commissions,   $40,659   in dealer manager fees,   $406,506   of other offering costs and   $42,597   in distribution and shareholder service fees in connections with the issuance and distribution of our registered securities.  
  We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate assets. On February 16, 2016, we satisfied the $2.0 million minimum offering amount for our initial public offering.  As a result, we have broken escrow and issued shares of common stock in the offering.   As of the date of this quarterly report, we have not commenced any significant operations. 
  Share Repurchase Program  
  Our common stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange and we will not seek to list our common stock unless and until such time as our board of directors ("Board") determines that the listing of our common stock would be in the best interests of our stockholders. In order to provide stockholders with the benefit of some interim liquidity, our Board has adopted a share repurchase program that enables our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to significant conditions and limitations. The terms of our share repurchase program are more flexible in cases involving the death or disability of a stockholder. We may reject any request for repurchase of shares.  
  Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, generally will be made quarterly. We will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5.0% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the previous calendar year. In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares using proceeds from our DRIP plus 1.0% of the operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year (to the extent positive) and any additional operating funds, if any, as our  
  
   23 
   (Back to Index)  

     (Back to Index)  

Board in its sole discretion may reserve for this purpose. Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.  
  Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until July 12, 2018 (the "NAV pricing date"), which is two years and 150 days after we satisfied the minimum offering requirement. Prior to the NAV pricing date, and unless the shares are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, we will initially repurchase shares at a price equal to, or at a discount from, the purchase price paid for the shares being repurchased as follows:  
                   Share Purchase Anniversary 
      
    Repurchase Price as a Percentage of Purchase Price 
      Less than 1 year 
      
    No Repurchase Allowed 
      1 year 
      
    92.5% 
      2 years 
      
    95.0% 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the NAV pricing date, shares received as a stock distribution will be redeemed at a purchase price of $0.00. In addition, the purchase price per share will be adjusted for any stock combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to the shares of common stock and reduced by the aggregate amount of net sale or refinance proceeds per share, if any, distributed to the stockholder prior to the repurchase date.  
  Shares repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability will be repurchased at a price per share equal to 100% of the amount the stockholder paid for each share, or, once we have established an estimated NAV per share, 100% of such amount, as determined by our Board, subject to any special distributions previously made to our stockholders. Shares repurchased in connection with a stockholder s other exigent circumstances, such as bankruptcy, within one year from the purchase date, will be repurchased at a price per share equal to the price per share we would pay had the stockholder held the shares for one year from the purchase date, and at all other times in accordance with the terms described above. A stockholder must have beneficially held the shares for at least one year prior to offering them for sale to us through our share repurchase program, unless the shares are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability, or certain other exigent circumstances. Our Board of Directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, to waive the one-year holding period requirement in the event of the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder, other involuntary exigent circumstances such as bankruptcy, or a mandatory distribution requirement under a stockholder s IRA. 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not receive any repurchase requests and did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.

 EXHIBIT 10.1

Exhibit 

PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT 
    
    THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT   (this    Agreement   ) is made and entered into as of this 13th day of September, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ), by and between   Sunnyside Commons LLC  , an Illinois limited liability company (the    Seller   ), and   Resource Innovation Office OP, LP  , a Delaware limited partnership or its nominee (the    Purchaser   ). 
    
  RECITALS  : 
    
  A.        Seller is the owner of certain real property legally described in   Exhibit A   attached hereto and commonly known as   1025 W. Sunnyside, Chicago, Illinois    (including, without limitation, all appurtenant rights such as the right, title and interest of Seller in and to any alleys, and any easements, rights-of-way or other interests in, on, under or to, any land, highway, street, road, right-of-way or avenue, open or proposed, in, on, under, across, in front of, and any of Seller s rights to sewers, curbs, curb cuts, sidewalks, landscaping, signage, mineral rights and water rights relating to such land, collectively, the    Land   ) and all buildings, fixtures and other improvements situated on the Land, if any (collectively, the    Improvements   ). 
    
  B.        Seller desires to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, the Land and the Improvements, together with all of the other property and interests of Seller described in   Section 1   below, all in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
    
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller and Purchaser agree as follows: 
    
  AGREEMENTS  : 
                   
  1.        AGREEMENT FOR PURCHASE AND SALE  .  Subject to and in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell and Purchaser agrees to purchase the Land and Improvements, together with all of Seller s right, title and interest in the following: (a) the equipment, fixtures and personal property located at, or used in connection with the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Land or the Improvements (exclusive of any of the foregoing owned by tenants under any Leases, as hereinafter defined), specifically including, but not limited to, the enumerated equipment, fixtures and personal property listed in   Exhibit B   attached hereto (collectively, the    Personal Property    (b) the Leases (as defined below), if any, and any security and other deposits with respect thereto, together with such other leases of the Improvements, if any, as may be made prior to Closing (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (c) the Surviving Service Contracts (as defined below), if any; and (d) the intangible rights in connection with the Land and the Improvements, if any, including, without limitation, any rights under any licenses, permits, warranties, plans and approvals relating to the Property (as defined below, but only to the extent any such licenses, permits, plans and approvals are assignable), contract rights, utility agreements or other rights related to the ownership of or use and operation of the Property, and to the extent assignable, any goodwill, telephone numbers, and other intellectual and intangible property used by Seller in connection with the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Property (all as more particularly described in the form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached hereto as   Exhibit G   and collectively referred to herein as the    Intangibles   ).  The Land, the Improvements, the Personal Property, the Leases, the Surviving Service Contracts, and the Intangibles and other property described above are collectively referred to herein as the    Property   . 

1 

2.        PURCHASE PRICE  . The purchase price for the Property (the    Purchase Price   ) shall be   Seven Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 DOLLARS ($7,250,000.00)  .  Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price to Seller at Closing by immediately available funds, less a credit for the Earnest Money (which shall be delivered to Seller at Closing);   provided  ,   however  , that the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to reflect the prorations between Purchaser and Seller set forth in   Section 10   below and elsewhere in the Agreement.  
    
  3.        EARNEST MONEY  .  Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall deposit with Acquest Title Services, LLC  located at 2800 W. Higgins Road, Suite 180, Hoffman Estates, IL (the    Title Company   ), as escrow agent, the sum of   One Hundred Thousand and 00/100 DOLLARS ($100,000.00)   in good funds as an earnest money deposit (the    Initial Earnest Money   ). Upon expiration of the Inspection Period (as defined below), provided that Purchaser has elected to proceed with the purchase of the Property, Purchaser shall deposit an additional sum of   One Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 DOLLARS ($150,000.00)   in good funds to be added to the Initial Earnest Money (collectively, the    Earnest Money   ). The Earnest Money shall be held and disbursed, including any interest earned thereon, pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof and the parties shall sign a customary, reasonably acceptable strict joint order escrow agreement substantially in the form provided by the Title Company, as such may be modified by the parties to coincide with the terms contained herein (the    Escrow Agreement   ).   Purchaser shall be permitted to instruct the Title Company to invest, at Purchaser s sole expense, the Earnest Money in an interest-bearing account or money market fund reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.  All interest on the Earnest Money shall accrue to Purchaser, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.  Whenever the Earnest Money is by the terms hereof to be disbursed by the Title Company, Seller and Purchaser agree promptly to execute and deliver such notice or notices as shall be necessary or, in the opinion of the Title Company, appropriate to authorize the Title Company to make such disbursement.  Upon the expiration of the Inspection Period, if Purchaser does not elect to terminate this Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be non-refundable except in the event of a Seller default or as otherwise expressly provided herein.  If the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is consummated, the Earnest Money shall be delivered to Seller and credited against the Purchase Price at Closing.   
    
  4.        CLOSING  .  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the    Closing   ), shall take place no later than the date that is   thirty (30)   days after the expiration of the Inspection Period at the Title Company, or at such other time and place to which the parties may mutually agree in writing; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have a one (1) time right to extend the then scheduled Closing for an additional thirty (30) days by (x) delivering written notice to Seller no later than six (6) business Days prior to the then scheduled Closing, and (y) depositing with the Title Company an additional   One Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 DOLLARS   (  $150,000.00  ), which shall be deemed part of the Earnest Money for all purposes of this Agreement (such date being referred to herein as the    Closing Date   ).  The Closing shall take place through an escrow established with the Title Company.  Neither party is required to be present at the actual Closing.  Upon the creation of such escrow, the transfer and conveyance of the Property, payment of funds and delivery of all instruments and other documents shall be made through the escrow in accordance with Purchaser s or Seller s respective escrow instructions to the Title Company, as long as such instructions are not in conflict with this Agreement.  Actual recordation of the transaction documents and issuance of the final Title Policy shall not occur until after the purchase and sale hereunder has closed and funds have been disbursed, with the Title Company bearing the risk for the  gap  between disbursement and recordation (subject to delivery of a reasonable and customary gap undertaking required from Seller and/or Purchaser by the Title Company).  All closing escrow costs shall be divided equally between Seller and Purchaser, provided that any investment fees and any closing escrow costs that relate solely to any acquisition loan obtained by Purchaser shall be borne solely by Purchaser.

5.        TITLE AND SURVEY  . 
    
  (a)  Conveyance of Title  .  Seller shall convey to Purchaser at Closing by special warranty deed, conveying marketable and insurable title to the Property (including, without limitation, fee simple title to the Land and Improvements) subject only to current city, state and county ad valorem property taxes not yet due and payable and all other exceptions on the Title Commitment (as defined below), other than those exceptions objected to by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Section (the    Permitted Exceptions   ).  
    
  (b)  Delivery of Title  .    Within   five (5)   days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, at Seller s expense, a current title commitment for a 2006 ALTA Owner s Policy issued by the Title Company in the amount of the Purchase Price, covering title to the Land and Improvements and showing title in Seller, together with legible copies of each of the documents underlying the title exceptions listed therein (collectively, the    Title Commitment   ).  At Closing, the Title Company shall deliver to Purchaser the Owner s Title Insurance Policy that is to be issued pursuant to the Title Commitment (the    Title Policy   ) with 
    
  (c)   extended coverage over the standard exceptions and with any endorsements to the Title Policy (or to any lender s policy required by Purchaser s lender (the    Lender   ) (if any)) which Purchaser or Lender desires beyond extended coverage.  Seller shall pay for the premium for the Title Policy with extended coverage. Purchaser shall pay the premium for any additional endorsements desired by Purchaser (other than those endorsements Seller elects to purchase to cure any title matters) as well as any Lender s title policy and for any additional endorsements to the Lender s policy beyond the endorsements provided in the Title Policy.   
    
  (d)  Delivery of Survey  .  Within   five (5)   days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, at Seller s expense, an as-built survey of the Land and Improvements, prepared by a land surveyor licensed by the state in which the Land is located and otherwise reasonably acceptable to Purchaser in accordance with the 2016 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys, jointly established and adopted by the American Land Title Association and the National Society of Professional Surveyors, (the    Survey   ).  
    
  (e)  Examination of Title and Survey  .  On or before the expiration of the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall furnish Seller with a written statement of title and survey matters to which Purchaser objects (an    Objection Statement   ).  All matters contained in the Title Commitment and the Survey to which Purchaser does not so object shall be deemed to be Permitted Exceptions.  Purchaser shall also have the right to examine, or cause to be examined, title and survey to the Property at any time or times after such initial title and survey examination and prior to Closing and to furnish Seller with a written statement or statements (a    Subsequent Objection Statement   ) of any and all additional matters, other than Permitted Exceptions, which affect the title to the Property or the use thereof and which arise or first appear of record from and after the effective date of the Title Commitment or which first appear on any subsequent revision to the Survey, as applicable, and to which Purchaser objects.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser is deemed to have rejected, without any need for notice, all mortgages, attachments, judgments, delinquent property taxes and assessments, other encumbrances or liens that can be removed by the payment of a sum of money (   Monetary Liens   ). Seller shall have until five (5) business days after receipt of any Objection Statement (or, with respect to any Subsequent Objection Statement, the earlier to occur of three (3) business days after receipt of such Subsequent Objection Statement, or the Closing Date, as applicable), to give notice to Purchaser as to whether or not Seller will agree to correct all matters described in such statement, except with respect to Monetary Liens, which Seller shall remove or cure at Closing with the proceeds from the Purchase Price.  If Seller does not agree to correct all matters described in any Objection Statement or Subsequent Objection Statement, then Purchaser, at its option exercised by written notice to Seller provided within three (3) business days after receipt of Seller s response (with the Closing Date to be postponed, if necessary, to give the benefit of the full three (3) business day period), may:  (x) decline to purchase the Property and terminate this Agreement, in which event Purchaser shall receive a full refund of the Earnest Money and the parties hereto shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder whatsoever, except for those  
  
   3 

rights and obligations that, by the express terms hereof, survive any termination hereof; or (y) waive such matters and proceed to Closing with a reduction in the Purchase Price only by such amounts that are of a definite and ascertainable amount and can be so determined.   Seller s failure to respond to any Objection Statement or Subsequent Objection Statement shall be deemed an election by Seller not to correct the matters described therein.  In the event that Purchaser fails to provide Seller with such written election within said period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement as provided in clause (x) above.  Should Purchaser accept, by written waiver, Seller s interest in the Property subject to matters in addition to the Permitted Exceptions, such acceptable matters shall thereafter be deemed to be Permitted Exceptions.

It is hereby agreed that Seller s damages in the event of a default by Purchaser hereunder are uncertain and impossible to ascertain, and that the Earnest Money constitutes a reasonable liquidation of such damages and is intended not as a penalty, but as full liquidated damages.   
    
  (b)        Seller s Default  .  In the event Seller defaults in any of its obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, if Seller s representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct in all material respects on the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date or if Seller fails to satisfy Purchaser s Contingencies, with the exception of Tenant Estoppels and SNDAs as discussed below, and such failure was within Seller s exclusive control), then Purchaser shall have the right to either (i) pursue specific performance of this Agreement (and recover Purchaser s reasonable attorneys  fees and costs in connection with Purchaser s specific performance action); or (ii) receive all of the Earnest Money back, and terminate this Agreement without further liability to the Seller. Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, in the event Seller is unable to deliver Tenant Estoppels or SNDAs before Closing, then Purchaser shall have the right to either (i) waive Seller s obligation to deliver Tenant Estoppels or SNDAs and proceed to Closing without a reduction in the Purchase Price; or (ii) receive all of the Earnest Money back, and terminate this Agreement without further liability to the Seller.

Purchaser may elect, by written notice to be delivered to Seller on or before the sooner of (a) the twentieth (20th) day after Purchaser s receipt of such notice from Seller, or (b) the Closing Date, to terminate this Agreement in which event the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser, and upon such refund neither party hereto shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement whatsoever, except for such rights and obligations that, by the express terms hereof, survive any termination of this Agreement.  If Purchaser elects to close this transaction notwithstanding such taking, condemnation or notice thereof, Purchaser shall be entitled to any award paid or payable to Seller as a result of such condemnation proceedings, with the same being paid or assigned to Purchaser at Closing.
