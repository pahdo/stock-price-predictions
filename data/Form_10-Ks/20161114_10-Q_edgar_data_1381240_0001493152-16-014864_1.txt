NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals
considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further
information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.  

Business
description    

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 7, 2006.  

The
Company has raised certain capital in an attempt to commence operation, however it has not done so. The Company s current
business plan is to explore potential targets for a business combination with the Company through a purchase of assets, share
purchase or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction. As we have not yet commenced principal operations we consider ourselves
a shell company.  

As
used in these Notes to the Financial Statements, the terms the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our 
and similar terms refer to Cyberspace Vita, Inc.  

NOTE
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

A.
USE OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

B.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

From
time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting
or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.

NOTE
3. GOING CONCERN    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated
net losses of $644,216 during the period of November 7, 2006 (inception) to September 30, 2016 and has a stockholders  deficit
of $599,938 as of September 30, 2016. These conditions, among others, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on working capital advances being
provided by the Company s majority shareholder for its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as
may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is no assurance that the working capital advances will continue in the future nor
that Company will be successful in raising additional funds through other sources.  

NOTE
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had loans and notes outstanding from a shareholder in the aggregate amount of $480,636, which
bears interest at 6% per annum and represents amounts loaned to the Company to pay the Company s operating expenses. On
December 31, 2015, the Payee under the Note and the Company agreed to extend the maturity date of the Note to December 31, 2016.
Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,014.  

Effective
as of May 5, 2008, the Company entered into a Services Agreement with Fountainhead Capital Management Limited ( FHM ),
a shareholder who holds approximately 80.8% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. The original term of the
Services Agreement was one year (and it has been extended to the end of fiscal year 2016) and the Company is obligated to pay
FHM a quarterly fee in the amount of $10,000, in cash or in kind, on the first day of each calendar quarter commencing May 5,
2008. Total fees paid to FHM for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,000.  

NOTE
5. INCOME TAXES    

As
a result of historical net operating losses, the Company currently provides a full valuation allowance against its net deferred
tax assets which consist of net operating loss carry forwards.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company does not have any accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company s
policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company does not have
any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. The tax years 2012 2015 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.  

NOTE
6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Based on this evaluation,
the Company has identified no reportable subsequent events.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto.    

Forward-Looking
Statements    

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management
as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. When used in this report, the words  believe, 
 anticipate,   expect,   estimate,   intend ,  plan  and similar expressions,
as they relate to us or our management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management s
current view of us concerning future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among many
others: a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities markets; federal or state laws or regulations having an adverse
effect on proposed transactions that we desire to effect; Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading
in the securities of  penny stocks  and other risks and uncertainties. Should any of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this
report as anticipated, estimated or expected. The accompanying information contained in this registration statement, including,
without limitation, the information set forth under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis and Plan of
Operation -- Risk Factors  identifies important additional factors that could materially adversely affect actual results
and performance. You are urged to carefully consider these factors. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statement.  

Overview    

We
are presently a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) whose plan of operation over the next twelve months
is to seek and, if possible, acquire an operating business or valuable assets by entering into a business combination. We will
not be restricted in our search for business combination candidates to any particular geographical area, industry or industry
segment, and may enter into a combination with a private business engaged in any line of business, including service, finance,
mining, manufacturing, real estate, oil and gas, distribution, transportation, medical, communications, high technology, biotechnology
or any other. Management s discretion is, as a practical matter, unlimited in the selection of a combination candidate.
Management will seek combination candidates in the United States and other countries, as available time and resources permit,
through existing associations and by word of mouth. This plan of operation has been adopted in order to attempt to create value
for our shareholders. For further information on our plan of operation and business, see PART I, Item 1 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 2015.  

Plan
of Operation    

We
do not intend to do any product research or development. We do not expect to buy or sell any real estate, plant or equipment except
as such a purchase might occur by way of a business combination that is structured as an asset purchase, and no such asset purchase
currently is anticipated. Similarly, we do not expect to add additional employees or any full-time employees except as a result
of completing a business combination, and any such employees likely will be persons already then employed by the company acquired.  

From
inception, the Company s business plan was to construct an e-commerce website by which we intended to engage in the sale
of vitamins on the Internet. The Company has now discontinued its prior business and changed its business plan. The Company s
business plan now consists of exploring potential targets for a business combination through the purchase of assets, share purchase
or exchange, merger or similar type of transaction. We anticipate no operations unless and until we complete a business combination
as described above.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report
in our financial statements, which we discuss under the heading  Results of Operations  following this section of
our Plan of Operation. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Due to the life cycle stage of our Company every balance
sheet account has inherent estimates.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015    

The
following table summarizes the results of our operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current 3-month period to the prior
3-month period:  

We
recorded a net loss of $20,850 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $20,006 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to September 30, 2015    

The
following table summarizes the results of our operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current 9-month period to the prior
9-month period:  

We
recorded a net loss of $65,953 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $62,218 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

We
have financed our operations during the quarter through proceeds from a loan from a shareholder in the amount of $16,962.  

We
had $0 cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 compared to $0 as of September 30, 2015. We will continue to need additional cash
during the following twelve months and these needs will coincide with the cash demands resulting from implementing our business
plan and remaining current with our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There is no assurance that we will be able to
obtain additional capital as required, or obtain the capital on acceptable terms and conditions.  

Going
Concern    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has not begun generating revenue, has experienced recurring net operating
losses, had a net loss of $20,850 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and a working capital deficiency of $599,938
at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. We will need to
raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms and that our disclosure and controls are not designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.  

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board
of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There
have been no changes in our  internal control over financial reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
