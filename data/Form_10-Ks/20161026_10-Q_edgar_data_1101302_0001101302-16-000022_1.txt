  (Unaudited) 
   
   1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Nature of Operations   Entegris, Inc. (Entegris or the Company) is a leader in specialty chemicals and advanced materials solutions for the microelectronics industry and other high-technology industries.   
  Principles of Consolidation   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany profits, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of Estimates    The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, particularly receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accrued expenses, and income taxes and related accounts, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and contain all adjustments considered necessary, and are of a normal recurring nature, to present fairly the financial position as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , and cash flows for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  . 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain certain information included in the Company s annual consolidated financial statements and notes. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued payroll and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those items. The fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was   $624.9 million   at   October 1, 2016   compared to the carrying amount of long-term debt, including current maturities, of   $608.8 million  .  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. To assist in this assessment, and to oversee the eventual adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, the Company has established a cross-functional steering committee. The initial analysis of identifying revenue streams and potential impacts of the new guidance is substantially complete, and the Company is now analyzing the potential magnitude to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition approach. 
    
  On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   which requires an entity to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability on the balance sheet. The update represents a change in accounting principle and required retrospective application. The update became effective January 1, 2016. Based on the balances as of December 31, 2015, in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03, the Company reclassified   $11.2 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs from other current assets and other noncurrent assets to long-term debt.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU No. 2016-02 requires the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees. In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve-month  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. Under ASU No. 2016-02, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation will be recorded for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases, and amortization and interest expense for financing leases. The balance sheet amount recorded for existing leases at the date of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 must be calculated using the applicable incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption. In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 requires the use of the modified retrospective method, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures, and the timing of adoption. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718).   ASU No. 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

4. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (EPS):    

The Company excluded the following shares underlying stock-based awards from the calculations of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  : 

5. FAIR VALUE 
  Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  The following table presents the Company s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets accessible at the reporting date for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

significant assumptions are observable in a market. Level 3 inputs are based on prices or valuations that require inputs that are significant to the valuation and are unobservable.

Losses associated with derivatives are recorded in other income, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Losses associated with derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments were as follows: 

In the first quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of   $0.5 million   related to an available-for-sale common stock investment classified in short-term investments in its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company determined that it was an other-than-temporary impairment due to the significant decline in the fair value compared to the investment's carrying value for an extended period of time and the financial condition of the issuer.  
   
  6. SEGMENT REPORTING 
    
  The Company reports its financial performance based on two reportable segments: Critical Materials Handling (CMH) and Electronic Materials (EM). The manager of CMH and EM is accountable for results at the segment profit level and reports directly to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for evaluating companywide performance and resource allocation decisions between the product groups. The Company's two reportable segments are business divisions that provide unique products and services.  
             
    CMH provides a broad range of products that filter, handle, dispense, and protect critical materials used in the semiconductor manufacturing process and in other high-technology manufacturing.  CMH s products and  
     
   10 

subsystems include high-purity materials packaging, fluid handling and dispensing systems and liquid filters as well as microenvironment products that protect critical substrates such as wafers during shipping and manufacturing.  CMH also provides specialized graphite components and specialty coatings for high-temperature applications. 
             
    EM provides high-performance materials, materials packaging and materials delivery systems that enable high-yield, cost-effective semiconductor manufacturing.  EM s products consist of specialized chemistries and performance materials, gas microcontamination control systems and components, and sub-atmospheric pressure gas delivery systems for the safe and efficient handling of hazardous gases to semiconductor process equipment.  
     Intersegment sales are not significant. Segment profit is defined as net sales less direct segment operating expenses, excluding certain unallocated expenses, consisting mainly of general and administrative costs for the Company s human resources, finance and information technology functions as well as interest expense, and amortization of intangible assets.  
    
  Summarized financial information for the Company s reportable segments is shown in the following tables.  

The following table reconciles total segment profit to income before income taxes and equity in net loss of affiliates:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements 
  The following discussion and analysis of the Company s condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read along with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The information, except for historical information, contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements could differ materially from actual results. You should review the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as well as in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. The Company assumes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision or updates to these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or unanticipated occurrences. 

Overview 
  This overview is not a complete discussion of the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations; it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of the Company's financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the detailed discussion and analysis that follows and must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Entegris is a leader in specialty chemicals and advanced materials solutions for the microelectronics industry and other high-technology industries. Our products and materials are used to manufacture semiconductors, micro-electromechanical systems, flat panel displays, light emitting diodes (LEDs), high-purity chemicals, such as photoresists, solar cells, gas lasers, optical and magnetic storage devices, and critical components for aerospace, glass manufacturing and biomedical applications. We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force and through selected distributors. 
    
  We offer a diverse product portfolio that includes approximately   20,000   standard and customized products which include both unit-driven and capital-expense-driven products.  Unit-driven products now comprise approximately 80% of our combined sales, with the balance being capital-expense-driven products.  Our unit-driven products are consumed or exhausted during the customer s manufacturing process and rely on the level of semiconductor and other manufacturing activity to drive growth. Our unit-driven product class includes membrane-based liquid filters, resin-based gas purifiers, wafer shippers, disk-shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products, implant gas storage and delivery systems, copper electroplating materials, advanced precursor materials for thin film deposition and photoresist strip and post chemical mechanical planarization, or CMP, cleaning materials and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components.  Capital-expense-driven products, which generally have a lifetime of 18 months or more, rely on the expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth and include our fluid management components, systems and subsystems that transfer, monitor, and control process liquids used in the semiconductor manufacturing processes, gas filtration and purification components, systems and subsystems that remove contaminants at equipment and factory level for manufacturing, our process carriers that protect the integrity of in-process wafers and graphite, silicon carbide and specialty coated components for manufacturing equipment. 
  The Company s fiscal year is the calendar period ending each December 31. The Company s fiscal quarters consist of 13-week or 14-week periods that end on Saturday. The Company s fiscal quarters in 2016 end April 2, 2016, July 2, 2016, October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Unaudited information for the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   and the financial position as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Key operating factors   Key factors that management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of Entegris include: 
             
    Level of sales   Since a significant portion of the Company s product costs (except for raw materials, purchased components and direct labor) are largely fixed in the short-to-medium term, an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly. Also, increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions, which are highly variable in nature. The Company s sales are subject to the effects of industry cyclicality, technological change, substantial competition, pricing pressures and foreign currency fluctuation. 
                
    Variable margin on sales   The Company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials. This is affected by a number of factors, which include the Company s sales mix,  
     
   12 

     Table of Contents  

purchase prices of raw material (especially polymers, membranes, stainless steel and purchased components), competition (both domestic and international), direct labor costs, and the efficiency of the Company s production operations, among others. 
             
    Fixed cost structure   The Company s operations include a number of large fixed or semi-fixed cost components, which include salaries, indirect labor and benefits, facility costs, lease expense, and depreciation and amortization. It is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short-term as volumes fluctuate. Accordingly, increases or decreases in sales volume can have a large effect on the usage and productivity of these cost components, resulting in a large impact on the Company s profitability. 
     Overall Summary of Financial Results  
    
  For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , net sales increased   10%   to   $296.7 million  , compared to   $270.3 million   for the three months ended   September 26, 2015  . The Company's sales increase reflects improved demand from the Company's semiconductor industry customers compared to the year-ago period. Favorable foreign currency translation effects were   $7.5 million   for the quarter. Exclusive of that factor, the Company's sales increased   7%  .  
    
  Sales were down   2%   on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2016. Exclusive of the favorable foreign currency translation effects of $3.0 million, the Company's sales decreased 3% sequentially.  
    
  Due to the net sales increase, the Company's gross profit for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   rose to   $123.0 million  , up from   $116.3 million   for the three months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The Company experienced a   41.5%   gross margin rate for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to   43.0%   in the comparable year-ago period. The gross profit and gross margin figures for the three months ended   October 1, 2016    reflect $6.3 million of charges related to impairment of equipment and severance.  Those charges reduced the Company's gross margin for the quarter by 2.1%.   
    
  The Company's selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses increased by   $4.9 million   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects higher employee costs offset by the absence of integration costs incurred in   2015   related to the   April 30, 2014   acquisition of ATMI, Inc. (ATMI).  
    
  As a result of the aforementioned factors, the Company reported net income of   $21.9 million  , or   $0.15   per diluted share, for the quarter ended   October 1, 2016   compared to net income of   $23.4 million  , or   $0.17   per diluted share, a year ago. 
  During the   nine  -month period ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company s operating activities provided cash flow of   $150.5 million   and cash used for capital expenditures was   $45.3 million  . Cash and cash equivalents were   $411.8 million   at   October 1, 2016   compared with cash and cash equivalents of   $349.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company had outstanding long-term debt of   $608.8 million   at   October 1, 2016  , compared to   $656.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  The critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are described in Item 7 of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the critical accounting policies used to prepare its condensed consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, those related to inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, income taxes and business acquisitions. There have been no material changes in these aforementioned critical accounting policies.

Net sales   For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , net sales increased by   10%   to   $296.7 million  , compared to   $270.3 million   for the three months ended   September 26, 2015  . An analysis of the factors underlying the increase in net sales is presented in the following table: 

The Company's sales increase was due to improved demand from the Company's semiconductor industry customers, reflecting both higher industry fab utilization rates and semiconductor industry capital spending compared to the year-ago period. Improved sales of 300mm transport module, liquid filtration and certain specialty materials products accounted for the increase. Favorable foreign currency translation effects were   $7.5 million   for the quarter, mainly due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. Exclusive of that factor, the Company's sales increased   7%  .  
    
  On a geographic basis, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , total sales to Asia (excluding Japan) were   57%  , to North America were   20%  , to Japan were   14%   and to Europe were   9%   compared to prior year   third   quarter sales to Asia (excluding Japan) of   56%  , to North America of   22%  , to Japan of   12%   and to Europe of   10%  . Sales increased by   28%  ,   2%  , and   12%   in Japan, North America and Asia, respectively, in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the prior year's   third   quarter. The majority of the improvement in Japan was due to favorable foreign currency translation effects related to the year-over-year strengthening of the Japanese yen. Sales in Europe fell   8%  . 
    
  Net sales for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   were   $866.8 million  , up   6%   from   $814.3 million   in the comparable year-ago period. An analysis of the factors underlying the increase in net sales is present in the following table:

     Table of Contents  

The Company's sales increase was due to improved demand from the Company's semiconductor industry customers and primarily reflects  increased sales of 300mm transport module, container, liquid filtration and advanced deposition material products, offset partly by a decrease in sales of certain specialty materials products. Favorable foreign currency translation effects were $9.9 million for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , mainly due the Japanese yen. Exclusive of that factor, the Company's sales increased 5%.  
    
  Sales were down   2%   on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2016. Exclusive of a favorable foreign currency translation effect, the Company sales decreased 3%. The decrease in revenue resulted from modest declines across the Company's product lines.  
    
  Gross profit   Due mainly to the sales increase, the Company's gross profit rose   6%   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   to   $123.0 million  , compared to   $116.3 million   for the three months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The Company experienced a   41.5%   gross margin rate for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to   43.0%   in the comparable year-ago period. The gross profit and gross margin figures for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   include charges of $6.3 million related to the impairment of equipment and severance. Those charges reduced the Company's gross margin for the quarter by 2.1%.   
    
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company's gross profit rose   4%   to   $376.9 million  , compared to   $360.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015  .  The Company experienced a   43.5%   gross margin rate for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to   44.3%   in the comparable year-ago period. The gross profit and gross margin figures for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   include charges of $6.3 million related to the impairment of equipment and severance.  Those charges reduced the Company's gross margin for the nine months by 0.7%.   
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses were   $51.6 million   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , up   $4.9 million  , or   10%  , from the comparable three-month period a year earlier. An analysis of the factors underlying the increase in SG A is presented in the following table: 

SG A expenses were   $153.2 million   for the first nine months of   2016  , up 4% compared to SG A expenses of   $147.9 million   in the year-ago period. An analysis of the factors underlying changes in SG A is presented in the following table: 

Engineering, research and development expenses   The Company s engineering, research and development (ER D) efforts focus on the support or extension of current product lines, and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies. ER D expenses were   $25.7 million   in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to   $26.8 million   in the year-ago period, a   $1.1 million   decrease.  The decrease for the quarter was mainly due to lower project expenses. 
    
  ER D expenses increased   1%   to   $79.8 million   in the first nine months of   2016   compared to   $79.2 million   in the year ago period, primarily due to higher employee costs.

Interest expense   Interest expense includes interest associated with debt outstanding issued to help fund the 2014 acquisition of ATMI and the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with such borrowings. Interest expense was   $9.5 million   in the three months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to   $9.3 million   in the three-month period ended   September 26, 2015  .  The increase reflects higher  amortization of debt issuance costs due to the acceleration of actual and expected payments on the Company's senior secured term loan, offset partly by the reduced interest payable on lower outstanding borrowings. 
  Interest expense was   $27.8 million   in the nine-month period ended   October 1, 2016   compared to   $28.9 million   in the nine-month period ended   September 26, 2015  .  The decrease reflects lower outstanding borrowings due to the Company's payments on its senior secured term loan in   2015  , offset partly by the higher amortization of debt issuance costs noted above. 
  Other income, net   Other income, net was   $0.6 million   and   $2.3 million   in the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, and consisted mainly of foreign currency transaction gains.  
  Other income, net was   $5.6 million   and   $8.5 million   in the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Other income, net included foreign currency transaction gains of $5.5 million and $8.8 million for the three-month and nine-month periods, respectively. Partly offsetting the nine-month figure was a $0.6 million loss related to the impairment and sale of an equity investment.   
    
  Income tax expense   The Company recorded income tax expense of   $3.9 million   and   $14.3 million  , respectively, in the three and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to income tax expense of   $4.0 million   and   $14.9 million  , respectively in the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015  . The Company s year-to-date effective tax rate was   16.8%   in   2016  , compared to   19.2%   in   2015  . The tax rate in both years reflect the benefit of foreign source income being taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Year-to-date income tax expense in   2016   also includes a discrete benefit of $1.1 million recorded in the second quarter related to the consolidation of certain of the Company's Taiwan entities.  
    
  Net income   Due to the factors noted above, the Company recorded net income of   $21.9 million  , or   $0.15   per diluted share, in the three-month period ended   October 1, 2016   compared to net income of   $23.4 million  , or   $0.17   per diluted share, in the three-month period ended   September 26, 2015  .

Critical Materials Handling (CMH) 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , CMH net sales increased to   $192.7 million  , compared to   $166.0 million   in the comparable period last year. This increase was due to improved sales of 300mm transport module and liquid filtration products, as well as favorable foreign currency translation effects of $5.2 million. CMH reported a segment profit of   $45.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , up   22%   from   $37.1 million   in the year-ago period primarily due to the increased sales, offset in part by an   8%   increase in operating expenses, reflecting higher selling expenses.  
    
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , CMH net sales increased   9%   to   $553.9 million   from   $507.8 million   in the comparable period last year. This increase also reflects improved sales of 300mm transport module, container and liquid filtration products, partly offset by lower sales of certain specialty materials products. Favorable foreign currency translation effects were $7.2 million year-to-date. CMH reported a segment profit of   $135.8 million   in the nine months ended   September 26, 2015  , up   11%   from   $122.2 million   in the year-ago period also due to higher sales levels, partly offset by a   7%   increase in operating expenses, mainly reflecting higher selling expenses.   
    
  Electronic Materials (EM) 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , EM net sales were flat at   $103.9 million   compared to   $104.2 million   in the comparable period last year. This result reflected a small improvement in the sale of advanced deposition material products, offset by a nominal decline in surface preparation product sales. EM reported a segment profit of   $20.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a   $23.9 million   segment profit in the year-ago period.  
    
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , EM net sales of   $312.9 million   were up   2%   from   $306.6 million   in the comparable period last year. The sales increase reflected an improvement in the sale of advanced deposition material products. EM reported a segment profit of   $69.5 million   in the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , essentially unchanged compared to a   $72.7 million   segment profit in the year-ago period. The   4%   decrease in segment profit mainly reflects an unfavorable sales mix, partly offset by a   2%   decrease in operating expenses.  
  Unallocated general and administrative expenses 
  Unallocated general and administrative expenses totaled   $20.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $18.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   $1.9 million   increase mainly reflects the increased employee and severance costs noted above and higher professional fees, offset in part by the absence of the integration expenses of   $2.1 million   recorded a year ago.  
    
  Unallocated general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   totaled   $61.3 million  , flat from   $61.0 million   in the nine months ended   September 26, 2015  . The year-to-year comparison reflects the absence of the integration expenses of   $7.1 million   recorded a year ago, offset by the increased employee and severance costs noted above and higher professional fees.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Operating activities   Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled   $150.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . Operating cash flows reflecting net income adjusted for non-cash expenses (such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation) was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $24.6 million  , mainly reflecting increases in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  
  Accounts receivable increased by   $26.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   $22.3 million   after accounting for foreign currency translation, mainly reflecting an increase in the Company s days sales outstanding (DSO). The Company s DSO was   52   days at   October 1, 2016   compared to   48   days at the beginning of the year.

Inventories increased by   $12.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   $17.3 million   after accounting for foreign currency translation and the provision for excess and obsolete inventory. The net increase primarily reflects higher levels of work-in-process inventory and finished goods due to increased levels of business activity.  
  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased   $24.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , or   $26.5 million   after accounting for foreign currency translation and payments for capital expenditures. The increase mainly reflects higher accounts payable associated with increased levels of business activity offset partly by the change in the Company's incentive compensation accruals, which includes the payment of   2015   incentive compensation during the first quarter of   2016  .  
    
  Working capital at   October 1, 2016   was   $563.4 million  , compared to   $533.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , and included   $411.8 million   in cash and cash equivalents, compared to cash and cash equivalents of   $349.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .

  Acquisition of property and equipment totaled   $45.3 million  , which primarily reflected investments in equipment and tooling. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company expects its full-year capital expenditures in   2016   to be in a range from $60 million to   $65 million  .  The Company's   2016   capital expenditure plans generally reflect more normalized capital spending levels. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had outstanding capital purchase obligations of   $10.9 million   for the construction or purchase of plant and equipment not yet recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as the Company had not yet received the related goods or property.  
    
  Financing activities   Cash flows used in financing activities totaled   $53.5 million   during the   nine  -month period ended   October 1, 2016  .  This primarily reflects the Company's payment of   $50.0 million   on its senior secured term loan described below.  In addition, the Company repurchased shares of the Company s common stock during the first quarter of   2016   at a total cost of   $3.6 million   under the stock repurchase program authorized by the Company s Board of Directors. The Company received proceeds of   $2.9 million   in connection with common shares issued under the Company's stock plans, while expending   $3.3 million   for taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards under the Company s stock plans.  
    
  As of October 1, 2016, the Company had outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion thereof, of $608.8 million, related to debt issued by the Company to fund its acquisition of ATMI as described in more detail below.  
    
  At October 1, 2016, the Company had outstanding $360 million aggregate principal amount of 6% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2022. 
    
  On April 30, 2014, the Company entered into a term loan facility that provided senior secured financing of $460 million. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company s option, a base rate (such as prime rate or LIBOR) plus, an applicable margin. The Company may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the term loan facility at any time.  The principal amount outstanding under the term loan facility at October 1, 2016 was $258.9 million. Based on management's plans and intent, the Company reflected $100 million as current maturities of long-term debt in its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  The Company also has a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility maturing   April 30, 2019   that provides financing of   $75 million  , subject to a borrowing base.  The senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to at the Company's option, a base rate (prime rate or LIBOR), plus an applicable margin. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had no outstanding borrowings and   $0.2 million   undrawn on outstanding letters of credit under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility.  
  Through   October 1, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants included in the terms of its senior unsecured notes, senior secured term loan facility and senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility.  
  The Company also has lines of credit with two banks that provide for borrowings of Japanese yen for the Company s Japanese subsidiary, equivalent to an aggregate of approximately   $11.9 million  . There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at   October 1, 2016  . 
  The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents, funds available under its senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and international credit facilities and cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months. If available liquidity is not sufficient to meet the Company s operating and debt service obligations as they come due, management would need to pursue alternative arrangements through

additional equity or debt financing in order to meet the Company s cash requirements. There can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms. 
  At   October 1, 2016  , the Company s shareholders  equity was   $897.2 million  , up from   $802.9 million   at the beginning of the year. The increase mainly reflected net income of   $71.0 million  , an increase to additional paid-in capital of   $10.1 million   associated with the Company s share-based compensation expense, proceeds of   $2.9 million   in connection with common shares issued under the Company's stock plans, and foreign currency translation effects of   $17.3 million  , mainly associated with the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the Korean won and Japanese yen. These increases were offset partly by the repurchase of the Company s common stock at a total cost of   $3.6 million   and the payment of   $3.3 million   for taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards under the Company s stock plans. 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company s resources included cash and cash equivalents of   $411.8 million  , funds available under its   $75 million   senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and international credit facilities, and cash flow generated from operations. As of   October 1, 2016  , the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries was   $239.6 million  . These amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, certain of which are associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, may be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company does not anticipate the need to repatriate funds associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes its existing balances of domestic cash and cash equivalents, available cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries not associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet the Company s domestic cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months.

Adjusted Operating Income, another non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as Adjusted EBITDA exclusive of the depreciation addback noted above. The Company also utilizes non-GAAP measures whereby Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income are each divided by the Company s net sales to derive Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin, respectively. 
    
  Non-GAAP EPS, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as net income before (1) severance related to organizational realignment, (2) impairment of equipment, (3) integration costs, (4) (gain) loss on impairment and sale of equity investment, (5) amortization of intangible assets and (6) the tax effect of those adjustments to net income, stated on a per share basis.  
  The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the Company s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions. 
  Management believes the Company s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company s business or future outlook and offer a useful view of business performance in that the measures provide a more consistent means of comparing performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors  overall understanding of the Company s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors  understanding of the Company s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income to assist it in evaluations of the Company s operating performance by excluding items that management does not consider as relevant in the results of its ongoing operations. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are used by management for planning and forecasting purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies; and for evaluating the Company s capacity to fund capital expenditures, secure financing and expand its business. 
  In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-GAAP financial measures in managing its business, the Company s Board of Directors uses non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process to determine management compensation. 
  The Company believes that certain analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and non-GAAP EPS as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of firms in the Company s industry. Additionally, lenders or potential lenders use Adjusted EBITDA measures to evaluate the Company s creditworthiness. 
  The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. 
  Management notes that the use of non-GAAP measures has limitations: 
  First, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. Accordingly, the methodology used to produce the Company s non-GAAP financial measures is not computed under GAAP and may differ notably from the methodology used by other companies. For example, the Company s non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to EBITDA or an adjusted EBITDA measure reported by other companies. 
  Second, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as amortization and depreciation that are recurring. Amortization of intangibles and depreciation have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense with an impact upon the Company s results of operations, notwithstanding the lack of immediate impact upon cash flows. 
  Third, there is no assurance the Company will not have future restructuring activities, translation-related costs, gains or losses on sale of equity investments, or similar items and, therefore, may need to record additional charges (or credits) associated with such items, including the tax effects thereon. The exclusion of these items from the Company s non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an implication that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.

Management considers these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, and non-GAAP EPS, and reconciliations between these financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP equivalents, are presented below in the accompanying tables.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Entegris  principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company s interest-bearing cash equivalents and senior secured financing obligation are subject to interest rate fluctuations. The Company s cash equivalents are instruments with maturities of three months or less. A 100 basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately   $1.0 million   annually. 
  The cash flows and results of operations of the Company s foreign-based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign-based operations. At   October 1, 2016  , the Company had no net exposure to any foreign currency forward contracts. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
  The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act)) as of   October 1, 2016  . The term  disclosure controls and procedures  means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on management s evaluation (with the participation of our CEO and CFO), as of   October 1, 2016  , the Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures used by the Company, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
  There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
