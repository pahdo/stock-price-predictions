1.  Business 
    
  La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company") is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies intended to significantly improve outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases.  The Company has several product candidates in development.  LJPC-501 is the Company s proprietary formulation of angiotensin II for the potential treatment of catecholamine-resistant hypotension.  LJPC-401 is the Company s novel formulation of synthetic human hepcidin for the potential treatment of conditions characterized by iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia, sickle cell disease and myelodysplastic syndrome.  LJPC-30S is the Company s next-generation gentamicin derivative program that is focused on therapeutics for the potential treatment of serious bacterial infections as well as rare genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The Company was incorporated in 1989 as a Delaware corporation and reincorporated in California in 2012. 
    
  The Company has a history of incurring significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations.  Since January 2012, when the Company was effectively restarted with new assets and a new management team, through   September 30, 2016  , the Company s cash used in operating activities was   $85.0 million  .  The Company had available cash and cash equivalents of   $85.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Based on current operating plans and projections, management believes that the available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into 2018. 

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there have been no changes to the Company s significant accounting policies as described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016.  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company at   September 30, 2016  , the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Estimates were made relating to useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowances, impairment of assets, share-based compensation expense and accruals for clinical trial and research and development expenses.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Certain amounts previously reported in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  Such reclassifications did not affect net loss, shareholders  equity or cash flows.  The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods. 
    
  Comprehensive Loss 
    
  Comprehensive loss for the periods reported was comprised solely of the Company s net loss.  The comprehensive loss for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $21.3 million   and   $53.3 million  , respectively, and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $10.5 million   and   $30.1 million  , respectively.  There were no other changes in equity that were excluded from net loss for all periods presented. 

4 

Net Loss Per Share 
    
  Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding unvested restricted stock awards.  Diluted net loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents.  Convertible preferred stock, stock options, warrants and unvested restricted stock awards are considered common stock equivalents and are included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share using the treasury stock method when their effect is dilutive.  Common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were common stock equivalents of   11.2 million   shares and   9.1 million   shares, respectively.  Common stock equivalents were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because they were anti-dilutive.           
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
    In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The new standard modifies multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting for share-based payments including income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2017.  The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.           
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets and eliminates certain real estate-specific provisions.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019 and will be adopted on a modified retrospective transition basis for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  The new standard requires management to assess, at each annual and interim reporting period, an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures.  ASU 2014-15 will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2016.  The adoption of this standard has no material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.           
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 781): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.  The new standard requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.  As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award.  Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered.  The Company adopted ASU 2014-12 effective as of January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.           
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The new standard is based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 and allows for full retrospective or a modified retrospective adoption approach.  The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

3.  Contract Revenue - Related Party 
    
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a services agreement with a related party.  Pursuant to the services agreement, the Company provides certain services to this related party, including, but not limited to, research and development and trial design and management for projects undertaken.  In exchange for providing such services, the Company is entitled to receive payments at a negotiated, arms-length rate.  As a result, the consideration received by the Company for its services is considered to be no less favorable to the Company than comparable terms that the Company could obtain from an unaffiliated third party in an arms-length transaction.  The services agreement may be canceled by either party  
  
   5 

upon   60  -days  written notice to the other party.  In addition, the Company has a non-voting profit interest in the related party, which provides the Company with the potential to receive a portion of the future distributions of profits, if any.  
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized approximately   $44,000   and   $531,000  , respectively, of contract revenue for services and costs provided under the services agreement.     

4.  Share-Based Compensation 
    
  Share-Based Compensation Expense 
    
  Share-based compensation expense recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. 
    
  Total share-based compensation expense related to all share-based awards for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was comprised of the following (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $33.2   million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options remains and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   3.0   years.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.9   million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards remains and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   5   months. 
    
  Stock Option Valuation 
    
  The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model), which uses the assumptions noted in the following table.  Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s common stock.  Expected life of employee stock options is determined using the  simplified  method.  The expected life of non-employee stock options is based on the contractual term of the stock options.  Risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the stock options in effect at the time of the grants.  Dividend yield is based on the expectation of no future dividend payments by the Company. 
    
  The Company estimated the fair value of each stock option grant on the grant date using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 

6 

Stock Option Activity 
    
  The Company s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan stock option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is comprised of the following: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   1,969,725   shares available for future grants under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. 
    
  Restricted Stock Award Activity 
    
  The Company s restricted stock award activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is comprised of the following: 

Warrants 
    
    At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   68,000   warrants outstanding.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company issued a warrant to purchase up to   17,000   shares of the Company s common stock to an outside third party at a price equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date.

  Business Overview 
    
  La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies intended to significantly improve outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases.  We have several product candidates in development.  LJPC-501 is our proprietary formulation of angiotensin II for the potential treatment of catecholamine-resistant hypotension.  LJPC-401 is our novel formulation of synthetic human hepcidin for the potential treatment of conditions characterized by iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia, sickle cell disease and myelodysplastic syndrome.  LJPC-30S is our next-generation gentamicin derivative program that is focused on therapeutics for the potential treatment of serious bacterial infections as well as rare genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
    
  Program Overview 
    
  LJPC-501 
    
  LJPC-501 is our proprietary formulation of angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II, the major bioactive component of the renin-angiotensin system, serves as one of the body s central regulators of blood pressure.  We are developing LJPC-501 for the 
  treatment of catecholamine-resistant hypotension (CRH), which is an acute, life-threatening condition in which blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels in patients who respond poorly to current treatments.  Angiotensin II has been shown to raise blood pressure in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in CRH, which was published in the journal Critical Care.  We have conducted preclinical pharmacology studies that have demonstrated that catecholamine resistance may be in part a result of reduced endogenous production of angiotensin II.  In October 2014, we presented positive data from a preclinical study of LJPC-501 for the treatment of CRH.  
    
  We initiated a Phase 3 trial of LJPC-501 for the treatment of CRH, called the ATHOS (Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock) 3 Phase 3 trial, in March 2015.  Prior to commencing the ATHOS 3 Phase 3 trial, we reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial.  In accordance with the SPA, the primary efficacy endpoint for the ATHOS 3 Phase 3 registration trial is increase in blood pressure at three hours.  The ATHOS 3 Phase 3 trial is designed to enroll approximately 315 patients.  Patients are to be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either: (i) LJPC-501 plus standard-of-care vasopressors; or (ii) placebo plus standard-of-care vasopressors.  Randomized patients are to receive their assigned treatment via continuous IV infusion for up to seven days.  The primary efficacy endpoint in the trial is to compare the change in mean arterial pressure in patients with CRH who receive an IV infusion of LJPC-501 plus standard-of-care vasopressors to those that receive an IV infusion of placebo plus standard-of-care vasopressors.  Secondary endpoints include comparison of changes in cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and the safety and tolerability of LJPC-501 in patients with CRH.  We expect to report top-line results from the ATHOS 3 Phase 3 trial in the first quarter of 2017.

LJPC-401 
    
  LJPC-401 is our novel formulation of synthetic human hepcidin.  Hepcidin, an endogenous peptide hormone, is the body s naturally occurring regulator of iron absorption and distribution.  In healthy individuals, hepcidin prevents excessive iron accumulation in vital organs, such as the liver and heart, where it can cause significant damage and even result in death.           
  We are developing LJPC-401 for the potential treatment of iron overload, which occurs as a result of diseases such as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), beta thalassemia, sickle cell disease (SCD) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  HH is a disease characterized by a genetic deficiency in hepcidin.  HH is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians and causes liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, heart disease and/or failure, diabetes, arthritis and joint pain.  Beta thalassemia, SCD and MDS are genetic diseases of the blood that can cause life-threatening anemia and usually require frequent and life-long blood transfusions.  These blood transfusions cause excessive iron accumulation in the body, which is toxic to vital organs, such as the liver and heart.  In addition, the underlying anemia causes excessive iron accumulation independent of blood transfusions.           
  In September 2016, we reported positive results from a Phase 1 trial of LJPC-401 in patients at risk of iron overload suffering from HH, thalassemia and SCD.  Single, escalating doses of LJPC-401 were associated with a dose-dependent, statistically significant reduction in serum iron.  LJPC-401 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities.  Injection-site reactions were the most commonly reported adverse event.  These were all mild or moderate in severity, self-limiting, and fully resolved. 
        Also in September 2016, we announced that we reached agreement with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the design of a pivotal trial of LJPC-401.  The pivotal trial will be a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial in beta thalassemia patients suffering from iron overload, a major unmet need in an orphan patient population.  The primary endpoint will be a clinically relevant measurement directly related to iron overload.  We plan to initiate this trial in mid-2017.  In 2015, the EMA Committee Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) designated LJPC-401 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of beta thalassemia intermedia and major, and, in 2016, the EMA COMP issued an opinion recommending LJPC-401 for designation as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of SCD.   
    
  LJPC-30S 
    
  LJPC-30S is our next-generation gentamicin derivative program.  Despite kidney toxicity, gentamicin has become one of the most commonly prescribed hospital antibiotics due to its broad spectrum of antimicrobial efficacy.  Gentamicin consists primarily of a mixture of four distinct but closely related chemical entities that may contribute differentially to the product s toxicity profile.           
  Our LJPC-30S program is focused on therapeutics derived from purified components of the currently marketed gentamicin product that retain the biologic activity of gentamicin, yet appear to lack the traditional kidney toxicity associated with its use.  This program includes the development of potential treatments for serious bacterial infections as well as rare genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
    
  In the area of rare genetic disorders, we believe that gentamicin s ability to induce a lack of fidelity in gene transcription, intrinsic to its antimicrobial mechanism of action, can also be leveraged in the correction of certain human genetic mutations that are the hallmark of diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  In spite of favorable short-term clinical proof-of-efficacy data in cystic fibrosis, development of gentamicin as a chronic treatment for these genetic diseases has been limited by its toxicity profile.           
  Following a pre-investigational new drug (IND) meeting with the FDA, we have received guidance that we may proceed with a proposed Phase 1 trial following the submission of an IND application. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  
   9 

There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed on February 25, 2016. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Recent accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q. 
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  The following summarizes the results of our operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Contract Revenue - Related Party 
    
    During the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into a services agreement with a related party.  Pursuant to the services agreement, we provide certain services to this related party, including, but not limited to, research and development and trial design and management for projects undertaken.  Contract revenue is a function of our available resources and the availability of potential projects identified by our customer.  As such, this revenue may be significantly reduced in future periods, as has happened year-over-year for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  In exchange for providing such services, we receive payments at a negotiated, arms-length rate.  As a result, the consideration received by us for our services is considered to be no less favorable to us than comparable terms that we could obtain from an unaffiliated third party in an arms-length transaction.  The services agreement may be canceled by either party upon 60-days  written notice to the other party.  In addition, we have a non-voting profit interest in the related party, which provides us with the potential to receive a portion of the future distributions of profits, if any. 
    
  Research and Development Expense 
    
  The following summarizes our research and development expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , research and development expense increased to   $17.0 million   and   $42.1 million  , respectively, from   $7.8 million   and   $19.6 million   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The increase was primarily due to increased clinical development costs associated with the Phase 3 trial of LJPC-501 for the treatment of CRH, clinical development costs associated with the Phase 1 trial of LJPC-401 in patients at risk of iron overload and preclinical costs associated with the LJPC-30S program.  Increases in personnel costs and share-based compensation  
  
   10 

expense associated with the support of our increased development activities also contributed to the increase in research and development expense.  We anticipate research and development expense to increase during the remainder of 2016, due to planned increases in personnel to support the continuation of our ongoing clinical trial of LJPC-501 and the ongoing development of our product candidates. 
    
  General and Administrative Expense 
    
    The following summarizes our general and administrative expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expense increased to   $4.3 million   and   $11.9 million  , respectively, from   $3.4 million   and   $11.1 million   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with the support of our increased development activities, partially offset by decreased share-based compensation expense.  We anticipate total general and administrative expense, excluding share-based compensation expense, to increase during the remainder of 2016, as the result of year-over-year increases in personnel to support the ongoing development of our product candidates. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Since January 2012, when La Jolla was effectively restarted with new assets and a new management team, through   September 30, 2016  , our cash used in operating activities was   $85.0 million  .  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we have incurred a cumulative net loss of   $581.8 million   and have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities, revenues from collaborative agreements, equipment financings and interest income on invested cash balances.  From inception through   September 30, 2016  , we have raised   $586.1 million   in net proceeds from the sales of equity securities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $85.0 million   in cash and cash equivalents, compared to   $126.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents at   December 31, 2015  .  Cash used in operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $40.1 million  , compared to   $16.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to increased research and development activities.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used   $1.4 million   of cash for investing activities related to purchases of property and equipment, compared to   $1.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had positive working capital of   $79.5 million  , compared to positive working capital of   $122.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in our cash and cash equivalents and working capital was primarily due to cash used for operating and investing activities. 
    
  Based on our cash and working capital as of   September 30, 2016   and our current operating plans and projections, we believe that the available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into 2018.  To fund future operations to the point where we are able to generate positive cash flow from the sales or out-licensing of our drug candidates, we will need to raise additional capital.  The amount and timing of future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and results of our ongoing development efforts, the potential expansion of our current development programs, potential new development programs and related general and administrative support, as well as the overall condition of capital markets, including capital markets for development-stage and clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies.  We anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through public and private equity and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements.  We cannot provide assurance that anticipated additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.  Although we have previously been successful in obtaining financing through equity securities offerings, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. 

11 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates.  There were no material changes to our market risks in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the disclosures in Item 7A of our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC, on February 25, 2016. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
    
  As required by the SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  No material changes to risk factors have occurred as previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016.
