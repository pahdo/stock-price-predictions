MEXUS GOLD US AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  
  September 30, 2016  
 (Unaudited) 
   
  1.  
  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OF COMPANY  
   
 Mexus Gold US (the  Company ) was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 22, 1990, as U.S.A. Connection, Inc. On October 28, 2005, the Company changed its  name to Action Fashions, Ltd. On September 18, 2009, the Company changed its  domicile to Nevada and changed its  name to Mexus Gold US to better reflect the Company s new planned principle business operations. The Company has a fiscal year end of March 31. 
   
 The Company is a mining company engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold, silver and copper projects in the State of Sonora, Mexico and the Western United States, as well as, the salvage of precious metals from identifiable sources. 
   
  2.  
  BASIS OF PREPARATION  
   
 Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. The condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. 
   
 The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using currently available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Three and six months figures are not necessarily indicative of the results to be reported at the year end.  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated   financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Management believes that the estimates used are reasonable. 
   
  Cash and cash equivalents  
   
 The Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
  Investments  
   
 Notes receivable and investment in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses (that are deemed to be temporary) reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses and charges for other-than-temporary impairments are included in determining net income, with related purchase costs based on the first-in, first-out method. For impairments that are other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value of the investment then becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.  

6 

Equipment  
   
 Equipment consists of mining tools and equipment, watercraft and vehicles which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows (see Note 5): 

Mining tools and equipment 
   7 years 
  
   Watercrafts 
   7 years 
  
   Vehicles 
   3 years 

Equipment under Construction  
   
 Equipment under construction comprises mining equipment that is currently being fabricated and modified by the Company and is not presently in use. Equipment under construction totaled $73,456 and $17,018 as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Equipment under construction at September 30, 2016 comprises Gold Recovery Cyanide Plant, Hydraulic Drum 12YD, Skid Mounted Mill and Survey Winch Marine. 
   
  Exploration and Development Costs  
   
 Exploration costs incurred in locating areas of potential mineralization or evaluating properties or working interests with specific areas of potential mineralization are expensed as incurred. Development costs of proven mining properties not yet producing are capitalized at cost and classified as capitalized exploration costs under property, plant and equipment. Property holding costs are charged to operations during the period if no significant exploration or development activities are being conducted on the related properties. Upon commencement of production, capitalized exploration and development costs would be amortized based on the estimated proven and probable reserves benefited. Properties determined to be impaired or that are abandoned are written-down to the estimated fair value. Carrying values do not necessarily reflect present or future values. 
   
  Mineral Property Rights  
   
 Costs of acquiring mining properties are capitalized upon acquisition. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new ore deposits, to expand the capacity of mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are also capitalized once proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property. Costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property and equipment costs, to determine if these costs are in excess of their recoverable amount whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Evaluation of the carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property and equipment costs would be based upon expected future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10-35-15,  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . 
   
  Long-Lived Assets  
   
 In accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

7 

Included in the ASC Topic 820 framework is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with Level 1 being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed by market participants spanning to Level 3 where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the Company and must be estimated using assumptions developed by the Company. The Company discloses the lowest level input significant to each category of asset or liability valued within the scope of ASC Topic 820 and the valuation method as exchange, income or use. The Company uses inputs which are as observable as possible and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company or valued item. 
   
 The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, advances, notes payable, and a loan payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. 
   
 Our investment in marketable securities is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.  
   
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in the interest rates. The notes payable, loans payable and secured convertible promissory notes have fixed interest rates therefore the Company is exposed to interest rate risk in that they could not benefit from a decrease in market interest rates. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the Company manages exposure through its normal operating and financing activities. 
   
  Foreign Currency Translation  
   
 The Company s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 740, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. 
   
 To the extent that the Company incurs transactions that are not denominated in its functional currency, they are undertaken in Mexican Pesos. The Company has not, as of the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
   
  Comprehensive Loss  
   
 ASC 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. As at September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no items that represent a comprehensive loss, and therefore has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
   
  Asset Retirement Obligations  
   
 In accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (ASC 410), the Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The associated asset retirement costs are supposed to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related mineral properties. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not recorded AROs associated with legal obligations to retire any of the Company s mineral properties as the settlement dates are not presently determinable. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 The Company recognizes revenues and the related costs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and acceptance has occurred or service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 

8 

Accounting for Derivative Instruments  
   
 Accounting standards require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. A change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in results of operations in the period of change. 
   
  Stock-based Compensation  
   
 The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award. 
   
 ASC 505,  Compensation-Stock Compensation , establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments to non-employees for goods or services. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505.  
   
  Per Share Data  
   
 Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation. 
   
  3.   
  GOING CONCERN   
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has a limited operating history and limited funds and has an accumulated deficit of $21,730,934 at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, may indicate that the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The Company is dependent upon outside financing to continue operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is management s plans to raise necessary funds through a private placement of its common stock to satisfy the capital requirements of the Company s business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds, or that if it is successful in raising the necessary funds, that the Company will successfully execute its business plan. 
   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to meet our obligations on a timely basis, and, ultimately to attain profitability. 
   
  4.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Affecting The Company   
   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted in annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

9 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

  The Company  
   
 Mexus Gold US is an exploration stage mining company engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold, silver and copper projects in the State of Sonora, Mexico. Mexus Gold US is dedicated to protect the environment, provide employment and education opportunities for the communities that it operates in. 
   
 Our President and CEO, Paul Thompson, brings over 45 years  experience in mining and mining development to Mexus Gold US. Mr. Thompson is currently recruiting additional management personnel for its Mexico and Nevada mining operations. 
   
 Our executive offices are located at, 1805 N. Carson Street, #150, Carson City, Nevada 89701. Our telephone number is (916) 776 2166.  
   
 We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on June 22, 1990, as U.S.A. Connection, Inc. On September 18, 2009, we changed our domicile to Nevada and changed our name to Mexus Gold US to better reflect our new business operations. Our fiscal year end is March 31 st .  
   
  Description of the Business of Mexus Gold US   
   
 Mexus Gold US is engaged in the evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and development projects in the United Mexican States, as well as, the salvage of precious metals from identifiable sources. Our main activities in the near future will be comprised of our mining operations in Mexico. Our mining opportunities located in the State of Sonora, Mexico will provide us with projects to recover gold, silver, copper and other precious metals.  
   
 In addition, our management will look for opportunities to improve the value of the gold projects that we own or may acquire knowledge of or may acquire control through exploration drilling, introduction of technological innovations or acquisition with the goal of developing those properties into operating mines. We expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition and development will continue in the future.  
   
  Business Strategy  
   
 Our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the exploration and development of our mineral properties, utilizing the extensive mining-related background and capabilities of our management consultants and advisors. To achieve this goal, our business plan focuses on the following prospective areas:  

15 

Mining Operations   
   
 We classify our mineral properties into three categories:  Development Properties ,  Advanced Exploration Properties , and  Other Exploration Properties . Development Properties are properties where a decision to develop the property into a producing mine has been made. Advanced Exploration Properties are those properties where we retain a significant ownership interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis to identify and report proven and probable reserves or other mineralized material. We currently do not have a Development Property or Advanced Exploration Property. Other Exploration Properties are those that do not fall into the other categories. Please see below for information about our Other Exploration Properties. 
   
 Effective March 31, 2011, we acquired Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V. (our wholly owned subsidiary) and began funding mining operations in Mexico. We have instituted a small placer processing operation to evaluate various areas of interest within the project lands. 
   
   Material Mining Properties   
   
  Santa Elena Prospect , (formerly known as the Caborca Project) 
   
 Our Santa Elena Prospect is comprised of early-stage exploration, including limited production operations, on the concessions. Under the terms of the concession agreement we also will acquire the associated surface. This concession is situated in the State of Sonora, Mexico.  
   
   Non-Material Minting Properties   
   
  Ures Prospects  
   
 The Ures Prospects, also situated in the State of Sonora, Mexico are the 370 Prospect, San Ramon Prospect, La Platosa Prospect, Edgar Prospect, Edgar II Prospect, Los Lareles Prospect, El Scorpio Prospect, and Ocho Hermanos Prospect. All of the Ures Prospects are early-stage exploration. 
   
  San Felix Mine  (formerly known as the Mexus-Trinidad Joint Venture) 
   
 In March, 2014, we sold our 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Atzek Mineral S.A. de C.V. Under the terms of the instrument covering the sale of our interest to Atzek Mineral S.A. de C.V., the purchaser is now considered in default. We are evaluating our options and expect to conduct such activities whereby we will secure our ownership interest. 
   
   Other Operations   
   
  Cable Salvage Operation  
   
 The Company completed the first phase of its Cable Recovery Project in Alaskan waters. The cable which was recovered was smaller diameter cable which was excellent for testing the recovery equipment and vessels. The Company evaluated the project and plans to conduct exploration activities in an attempt to identify larger cable. Presently a mapping project of the large cable is being conducted with further testing of recovering this large diameter cable scheduled soon thereafter. Should those activities identify any cable suitable for salvage operations, the Company would determine the proper title and ownership, if any, of the cable and once such title is determined act accordingly as to whether or not a recovery operation is economically feasible.  
   
  Mergers and Acquisitions  
   
 We will routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities. An appropriate merger and acquisition opportunity must be accretive to the overall value of Mexus Gold US. Our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near-term production with a secondary focus on other resource-based opportunities. Potential acquisition targets would include private and public companies or individual properties. Although our preference would be for candidates located in the United States and Mexico. Mexus Gold US will consider opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptable.

Description of Mining Projects  
   
 The following properties are located in Mexico and owned by Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V., our wholly owned subsidiary: 
   
  Santa Elena Prospects  (formerly known as the Caborca Project )  
   
 The Company executed a revised Mineral Mining and Purchase Agreement, dated December 3, 2015, with the Concession Owners covering 2,225 acres located in the State of Sonora, Mexico. The Agreement is for a term of 25 years and specifies a purchase privilege, at the discretion of the Company, for all concessions in the amount of $2,000,000 absent the exercise of the purchase privilege a royalty of 40% for lode deposits and 25% for placer deposits and is credited to the purchase price. The Agreement specifies a delayed monthly royalty in the amount of $1,000 and the payment of the semi-annual concession tax. 

The Company has conducted geological evaluation of the Santa Elena Prospects comprised of expanding the existing placer facility for the purpose of mineral evaluation, physical geological evaluations including the drilling of reverse circulation and core holes. Situated on the prospect area are caterpillars, haul trucks, maintenance trucks, power generators, pumps, tractor blade, truck mounted winch, water handling supplies and maintenance trailer with supplies. The prospect area is accessed from a state highway on existing roads. There is access to well water which is available for the current and future operations. 
   
 On January 5, 2011, Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. entered into a Purchase Agreement to purchase the Santa Elena Prospect, formerly known as the Caborca Project. The Santa Elena Prospect consists of 7,400 acres (3,000 hectares) about 50 kilometers northwest of the City of Caborca, Sonora State, Mexico. The Caborca Project lies on claims filed by the owners of the Santa Elena Ranch, which controls the surface rights over the project claims. The claims lie near 112 o  25' W, 31 o  7.5  N. These claims were visited near the end of January, 2011. On or about July 11, 2011, we acquired five additional claims surrounding the Santa Elena Prospect consisting of approximately 1,000 additional acres.  
   
 We have been unable to locate geologic maps of the area from the Government Geological Survey. However, pursuant to our investigation of the project, the claims were found to be underlain by an igneous complex. The rocks observed included many types of granitic rocks, exhibiting porphyrytic textures, gneissic and equigrannular textures. Quartz was variable. At times quartz  eyes  were observed, that is porphyrytic quartz which many workers consider to be indicative of a porphyry environment. In other localities, no quartz was evident. When no quartz was present, the rock was equigrannular. Quartz veining was evident throughout the claim group. A mine was developed along a major quartz vein, called the Julio 2 Mine with the vein being called the Julio Vein.  
   
 There are multiple exploration targets on the Santa Elena Prospect. The two most important are the quartz stockwork zone and the Julio vein system. The first target will be the quartz stockwork zone area. A drilling program has been conducted and a limited mining production operation is scheduled to test this area. 
   
 Access to the Santa Elena prospect is via dirt road approximately two miles west of paved highway Mexico 1 and approximately 34 miles northwest of the town of Caborca, Sonora, Mexico.

   Ocho Hermanos   Guadalupe de Ures Project   
   
 The Guadalupe de Ures Project is accessed from Hermosillo by driving via good paved road for 60 kilometers to the town of Guadalupe de Ures and then for 15 kilometers over dirt roads to the prospects. A base camp has been established near the town of Guadalupe de Ures using mainly trailers for accommodation, workshops and kitchen facilities. 

18 

FIGURE 2 - GUADALUPE DE URES PROJECT LOCATION MAP  
   
 The Ocho Hermanos Project (also called the Guadalupe de Ures Project) consists of the  Ocho Hermanos  and  San Ramon  claims which are covered by the Sales and Production Contract dated the 4 th  day of July, 2009 between  Minerales Ruta Dorado de RL de CV  (seller) and  Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. , a wholly owned subsidiary of Mexus Gold US (buyer). The Ocho Hermanos Claim consists of 34.9940 hectares (1 acre = 0.4047 hectares) or 86.4690 acres while the San Ramon Claim consists of 80 hectares (197.6773 acres).(Figure 4). 
   
 The term of the agreement is 5 years. During the term Mexus must pay 40% of the net revenue received for minerals produced to the seller. At the conclusion of the 5 years, the lease can be purchased for USD 50,000. The agreement has expired and the Company is currently in negotiations to extend the agreement. 
   
 Minerales Ruta Dorado de RL de CV is a duly constituted Mexican Company and as such can hold mining claims in Mexico.

FIGURE 3 - OCHO HERMANOS  
  PROJECT AREA CLAIM MAP  
   
 We did not perform any systematic sampling or any systematic drilling and because of this did not set up a formal QA/QC program. All of the samples were submitted to Certified Laboratories (ALS - Chemex in Hermosillo or American Assay in Reno, Nevada) which insert their own QA/QC samples/duplicates. Also the laboratories run duplicates and blanks from each batch fired. The sequence of events so far are the following: 
   
 We located a previously mined area with interesting values   Ocho Hermanos Mexus began to submit characterization samples to the above noted assay laboratories, in order to determine the range of Au - Ag values present. Mexus then began an investigation into recovery options by using material taken from the areas with the better values. 
   
 The above work was completed before any systematic exploration was done because if no recovery method could be found relatively quickly, the project would move more slowly because of the lead time involved. Mexus began work on an Environmental Impact Statement for the likely operational area (a total of 4 hectares to begin). In order to complete the EIS, figures for estimated tonnages were submitted to cover the hoped for volume. To date, no suitable recovery method was found due primarily to the partial oxidation of the principally sulfide deposit. 
   
 The Environmental Permits run for 35 years so there is time for further investigation. 
   
 The main geologic feature of this project area is an apparent  manto  sulfide zone composed primarily of galena with some pyrite, arsenopyrite and possibly phyrrotite. Above this zone there is an oxide zone composed of iron and lead oxides. The sulfides themselves are partially oxidized. Reconnaissance and characterization samples taken indicated sporadically high gold and silver values. The deposit occurs in shallow water sediments (principally quartzites, with some limestone and shales) and can be best characterized as a skarn type deposit due to the presence of intrusive rocks within 1 kilometer.  

20 

Given the complex nature of the sulfide deposit and the partial oxidization of the material (indicated by the presence of yellow colored lead oxides), a satisfactory recovery method has not yet been found. Consequently, at this time, no further systematic work beyond the initial reconnaissance and characterization sampling has been completed. The entire project was essentially put on hold until a suitable recovery method is found, which is a continuing effort and at this time is being pursued by member of the faculty at the University of Sonora in Hermosillo. The faculty member teaches metallurgy and assay practices at the University. After a suitable recovery method has been identified, the process will need to be confirmed by a certified metallurgical testing laboratory. 
   
 The Environmental Permits detail all of the affected flora and fauna. The land is presently used for cattle grazing and the surface rights are owned by the community of Guadelupe de Ures. An agreement is in place with Mexus Gold Mining S.A. de C.V. for surface access and disturbance. The Environmental Permit concludes that no permanent damage or degradation of the present land use will result from the intended activity on the lands. At present, the Environmental Permits cover a total of 4 hectares - 3 hectares cover the initial site of the mineral as presently understood and 1 hectare is permitted for the erection of a suitable extraction plant.  
   
 No known contamination from past mining activities was found or is known to locals. The historic workings consisted of a few shallow adits and pits. In the course of obtaining the Environmental Permission the permit stipulated that properly lined ponds etc. must be used to prevent any potential surface or ground water contamination from any proposed activities.  
   
 Only separation is proposed to be conducted on site if found to be possible, while final metal recovery will be conducted at a properly licensed and certified metal refining facility. Current efforts to find suitable recovery methods are being conducted off site in a University laboratory. Up sizing the process, if found, will be completed by a licensed, certified metallurgical laboratory. 
   
 Figures of the proposed permitted sites are attached. These were extracted from the environmental permit 
 Application.

  AREA DE EXTRACCION  
   
  370 Area  
   
 This zone is composed of a sedimentary sequence (limestone, quartzite, shale) intruded by dacite and diorite as well as rhyolite. The dacite exhibits argillic alterations as well as silicification (quartz veins). The entire area is well oxidized on the surface. This is an area of classic disseminated low grade gold and silver mineralization. Surface grab sample assays show 0.14 grams per ton to as high as 29.490 grams per ton gold. This area is an important area for potentially defining an open pit heap leach project. 

22 

El Scorpion Project Area  
   
 This area has several shear zones and veins which show copper and gold mineralization. Recent assays of an 84  drill hole shows 1.750% per ton to .750% per ton of copper and 3.971 grams per ton to 0.072 grams per ton of gold. Another assay of rock sample from the area shows greater than 4.690% per ton copper. This land form distribution appears to be synonymous to the ideal porphyry deposit at Baja La Alumbrera, Argentina. 
   
  Los Laureles  
   
 Los Laureles is a vein type deposit mainly gold with some silver and copper. Recent assays from grab samples show gold values of 67.730 grams per ton gold, 38.4 grams per ton silver, 2,800 grams per ton copper. 
   
 As of the date of this Report, we have opened up old workings at the Los Laureles claim and have discovered a gold carrying vein running north and south into the mountain to the south.  

Employees   
   
 We have no employees at this time in the United States. In Mexico we currently have seven employees carrying out administrative and security duties. Consultants with specific skills are utilized to assist with various aspects of the requirements of activities such as project evaluation, property management, due diligence, acquisition initiatives, corporate governance and property management. If we complete our planned activation of the operations of the Mexican mining properties, our total workforce will be approximately 20 persons. Mr. Paul D. Thompson is our sole officer and director. 
   
  Competition   
   
 We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties. There is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities, some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than Mexus Gold US. As a result, Mexus Gold US may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices.  
   
 Management of Mexus Gold US believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market.  
   
  Legal Proceedings   
   
 There are no legal proceedings to which Mexus Gold US or Mexus Gold S.A. de C.V. is a party or of which any of our properties are the subject thereof. 
   
  Property Interests, Mining Claims and Risk  
   
  Property Interests and Mining Claims   
   
  Our exploration activities and operations in Mexico are subject to the rules and regulations of the United Mexican States. The Ministry (Secretariat) of Mining is the Federal Mexican Government ministry charged with controlling all mining matters. A concession is granted on the acceptance of an application which identifies the specific minerals to be mined and description of the exact location of the lands to be mined. The concession is subject to a semiannual tax to continue the concession in good standing. Usually, our arrangements with a concessionaire describe specific period payments to be concessionaire and a royalty on the minerals recovered from mining operations. Where prospective mineral properties are identified by the Company, some type of conveyance of the mining rights and property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for us to explore or develop such property. Generally, these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty, usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production. Other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements. 

23 

Reclamation   
   
 We may be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.  
   
 While the Company, as of September 30, 2016, does not have a legal obligation associated with the disposal of certain chemicals used in its leaching process, the Company estimates it will incur costs up to $50,000 to neutralize those chemicals at the close of the leaching pond. 
   
  Risk  
   
 Our success depends on our ability to recover precious metals, process them, and successfully sell them for more than the cost of production. The success of this process depends on the market prices of metals in relation to our costs of production. We may not always be able to generate a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals because we can only maintain a level of control over our costs and have no ability to control the market prices. The total cash costs of production at any location are frequently subject to great variation from year to year as a result of a number of factors, such as the changing composition of ore grade or mineralized material production, and metallurgy and exploration activities in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body or deposit. In addition costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in production costs or a decrease in the price of gold or other minerals could adversely affect our ability to earn a profit on the sale of gold or other minerals. Our success depends on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of precious metals to recover our investment and operating costs.  
   
  Distribution Methods of the Products  
   
 The end product of our operations will usually be dor  bars. Dor  is an alloy consisting of gold, silver and other precious metals. Dor  is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% pure gold. Under the terms of refining agreements we expect to execute, the dor  bars are refined for a fee and our share of the refined gold, silver and other metals are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers who will then use the refined metals for fabrication or held for investment purposes.  
   
  General Market  
   
 The general market for gold has two principal categories, being fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. The supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals.  
   
  Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts, including duration;  
   
 We do not have any designs or equipment which is copyrighted, trademarked or patented. 
   
  Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business  
   
  Government Regulation   
   
 Mining operations and exploration activities in Mexico are subject to the Ministry of Mining federal laws and regulations which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe that Mexus Gold US is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder any jurisdiction in which we will operate. We are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to Mexus Gold US with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.  

24 

Environmental Regulation  
   
 Our gold projects are subject to various Mexican federal laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that the actions and operations of Mexus Gold US will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current Mexican federal laws and regulations where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.  
   
  Research and Development  
   
 We do not foresee any immediate future research and development costs. 
   
  Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws  
   
 Our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The economics of our current projects consider the costs and expenses associated with our compliance policy. 
   
 Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Mexico, where we operate currently, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs.

  Results of Operations   
   
 The following management s discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition of Mexus Gold US is for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All amounts herein are in U.S. dollars. 
   
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
 We had a net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,965,863 compared to a net loss of $569,941 during the same period in 2015. The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to no revenues, stock-based expense   consulting services of $1,084,362 and loss on settlement of notes payable and accounts payable of $435,716 and an increase in other expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

 Total operating expenses increased to $1,873,783 during three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $718,845 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock-based expense   consulting services and loss on settlement of accounts payable and notes payable.  
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 We reported $92,080 of other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $151,194 other income during the same period in 2015. 
   
 Changes in other income (expense) is mainly attributable to (i) the decrease of other income of $62,264 and (ii) decrease in gain of derivative liabilities of $159,711. 

25 

Six months Ended September 30, 2016 compared with the Six Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
 We had a net loss during the six months ended September 30, 2016 of $2,593,598 compared to a net loss of $936,038 during the same period in 2015. The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to no revenues, stock-based expense   consulting services of $1,146,362, loss on settlement of notes payable and accounts payable of $729,716 and an increase in other expenses during the six months ended September 30, 2016.

 Total operating expenses increased to $2,416,891 during six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,126,415 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock-based expense   consulting services and loss on settlement of accounts payable and notes payable.  
   
  Other Income (Expense)  
   
 We reported $176,707 of other expense during the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $172,023 other income during the same period in 2015. 
   
 Changes in other income (expense) is mainly attributable to (i) the decrease of other income of $103,724 and (ii) decrease in gain of derivative liabilities of $192,905. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $15,332 compared to cash of $30,461 at March 31, 2016.  
   
 Our prepaid and other assets increased to $251,585 from the sale of equipment. 
   
 Our equipment increased to $603,443 at September 30, 2016, compared to $527,961 at March 31, 2016. The increase in equipment is largely due to the reclassification of equipment as held for sale. 
   
 Our mineral properties had no change during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Equipment under construction increased to $73,456 at September 30, 2016, compared to $17,018 at March 31, 2016. The increase in equipment is largely due to the reclassification of equipment as held for use. 
   
 Total assets increased to $1,449,763 at September 30, 2016, compared to $1,364,603 at March 31, 2016. The majority of the increase is due to an increase in prepaid stock-based compensation. 
   
 Our total liabilities increased to $656,200 at September 30, 2016, compared to $1,025,677 as of March 31, 2016. The decrease in our total liabilities can be primarily attributed the settlement of accounts payable and notes payable with shares of common stock of the Company. 
   
 Our working capital deficit at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 is $389,283 and $995,216, respectively. 
   
 Our net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is $432,886 and $130,753, respectively. Our net loss for the six months ended of $2,593,598 was the main contributing factor for our negative cash, offset mainly by depreciation and amortization of $115,333, interest expense of $168,397, stock-based compensation   services of $1,146,362 and loss on settlement of accounts payable of $729,716. 
   
 Our net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is $38,440 and $6,840, respectively, mainly due to the sale of equipment. 

26 

Our net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is $379,317 and $121,166, respectively, mainly due to issuance of notes payable and sale of common stock. 
   
 The Company is dependent upon outside financing to continue operations. It is management s plans to raise necessary funds through a private placement of its common stock to satisfy the capital requirements of the Company s business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds, or that if it is successful in raising the necessary funds, that the Company will successfully execute its business plan. 
   
  Future goals  
   
 The Caborca Properties have become our primary focus after our installation of a small placer recovery plant to conduct tests on prospective placer areas and determine the viability of the placer deposits while we conducted evaluations of the other Mexico properties. We have added additional equipment which will allow the continuation of mining operations of the placer deposits. 
   
 The Company has now scheduled the installation of a crushing/milling recovery plant for the high grade Julio quartz deposit as a result of the values of the assay analysis from the deposit which range from .250 to 5.5 ounces of gold per ton.  
   
 Therefore, our goal for the current year is to increase the cash flow of the placer mining operation, continue the drilling program which began during 2011, initialize mining operations on the Julio quartz deposit while we conduct a thorough geological study by an independent geological firm of the future potential of other vein deposits located near the Julio deposit. 
   
  Foreign Currency Transactions  
   
 The majority of our operations are located in United States and most of our transactions are in the local currency. We plan to continue exploration activities in Mexico and therefore we will be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. We do not trade in hedging instruments and a significant change in the foreign exchange rate between the United States Dollar and Mexican Peso could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  
   
  ITEM 3.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 
   
  ITEM 4(T).  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
   
 Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our procedures were designed to ensure that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management is currently evaluating the current disclosure controls and procedures in place to see where improvements can be made.

ITEM 5.  
  OTHER INFORMATION  
   
  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
   
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in  Internal Control Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Steps that the Company believes it must undertake is to retain a consulting firm to, among other things, design and implement adequate systems of accounting and financial statement disclosure controls during the current fiscal year to comply with the requirements of the SEC. We believe that the ultimate success of our plan to improve our disclosure controls and procedures will require a combination of additional financial resources, outside consulting services, legal advice, additional personnel, further reallocation of responsibility among various persons, and substantial additional training of those of our officers, personnel and others, including certain of our directors such as our committee chairs, who are charged with implementing and/or carrying out our plan.  
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required in Rule 13a-15(b). We are conducting an evaluation to design and implement adequate systems of accounting and financial statement disclosure controls. We expect to complete this review during 2016 to comply with the requirement of the SEC. We believe that the ultimate success of our plan to improve our internal control over financial reporting will require a combination of additional financial resources, outside consulting services, legal advice, additional personnel, further reallocation of responsibility among various persons, and substantial additional training of those of our officers, personnel and others, including certain of our directors such as our Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer, who are charged with implementing and/or carrying out our plan. It should also be noted that the design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
   
 Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting, or any system we design or implement in the future, will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control  
   
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
