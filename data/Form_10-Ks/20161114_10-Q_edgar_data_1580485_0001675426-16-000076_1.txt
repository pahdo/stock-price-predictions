NOTE 2.   SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

  Basis of Presentation   

 The Company s unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These unaudited condensed
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes for the year ended December
31, 2015 included on the Company s Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2016. The results of the nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

  Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information that is currently available
to the Company and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Investment in Marketable Securities  

 The Company s securities investments
that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities. Trading
securities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet in current assets, with the change in fair value during the period included
in other income and expense. 

Revenue Recognition  

 Revenue is only recognized when all
of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, (3) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. 

On occasion the Company may receive
payment for a sale in advance of shipping the product. When this occurs the funds received are considered to not yet be earned
and are reported as a liability on the financial statements as deferred revenue. 

Returns, Repairs and Exchange Policy  

 It is the policy of the Company
to issue no refunds once an order has been shipped unless due to product defects or Company error. The default warranty for all
products is 14 days unless otherwise specified. Eligibility for refunds, repairs or exchanges are limited to products determined
to have manufacturing defects or premature failure. Products that are damaged through misuse, negligence, and abuse or modified
or repaired by anyone other than Vapetek, Inc. are not eligible for exchange. 

 Shipping fees are non-refundable. 

The Company records shipping costs in accordance with
EITF 00-10 Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. Accordingly, the shipping costs is shown in the financial statements
to be included with general and administrative expense. 
 
Due to personal tastes and preferences the Company does not offer returns, refunds or exchanges for e-liquid products. All e-liquid
purchases are final. 

 If fulfillment errors occur, requests
to correct mistakes that are made by the Company resulting in a customer s receipt of incorrect or missing items in the order
will be accepted for 14 days after the receipt of the order. Requests for missing or incorrect items will not be accepted after
14 days from the date the order has been received. 

Stock-based compensation  

 The Company accounts for equity based
transactions with non-employees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees 
( Topic No. 505-50 ). Topic No. 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with non-employees shall
be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more
reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505,  Equity ,
whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either (a) the date at which a
performance commitment is reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instrument is complete.
The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In
general, the Company recognizes an asset or expense in the same manner as if it was to pay cash for the goods or services instead
of paying with or using the equity instrument. 

The Company accounts for employee stock-based
compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation  which requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based
on their fair values on the grant date.  The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation
expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered. There has been no stock-based
compensation issued to employees. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements  

 The Company has implemented all new
accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been
issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

CONCERN   

 The accompanying

satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and has an accumulated
a deficit of $629,219 as of September 30, 2016.  The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing

unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations,

The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned
uncertainties.

Company Overview  

Corporate History   

The Company was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2013, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. 

On March 6, 2014, we entered into a
Share Purchase Agreement, resulting in a change of control, with Alham Benyameen and Andy Michael Ibrahim whereby Richard Chiang
our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President, CEO, CFO and Secretary elected Mr. Benyameen as our Chairman of the Board of
Directors and Mr. Ibrahim as our President, CEO, CFO, Secretary and Member of our Board of Directors. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Mr.
Chiang our former President and CEO sold 7,200,000 shares of Vapetek, Inc., formerly known as ALPINE 2 Inc. to Mr. Benyameen and
Mr. Ibrahim in exchange for $20,000. Mr. Chiang simultaneously resigned from his positions held in the Company. Upon the closing
of our Share Purchase Agreement, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Benyameen and Mr. Ibrahim as officers and directors
of ALPINE 2 Inc. We issued in advance 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Benyameen and 20,000,000 shares of our common
stock to Mr. Ibrahim. These shares were valued at par $0.0001 at the time of transfer. Immediately after the closing of the Share
Purchase Agreement, we had 50,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, no shares of preferred stock, no options, and no warrants
outstanding. On March 12, 2014, we filed a certificate of amendment of certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware
and on March 25, 2014, officially amended our name from ALPINE 2 Inc., to Vapetek Inc. 

On April 1, 2014, the Company entered
into a product distribution agreement with West Coast Vape Supply Inc. to supply electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, e-liquids,
and accessories, and other third party products.  West Coast Vape Supply Inc. is a related
party and owned 100% by the management of Vapetek Inc.   

On August 11, 2014, we entered
into a Licensing Agreement with PennyGrab Inc. ( PennyGrab ). PennyGrab is the owner of technology, including software
code, relating a website designed for wholesale, retail, and online auction compatible products. The software code is a PHP website
script that is 100% customizable and is SEO friendly that improves site search engines rankings. The software code is the  Licensed
Technology.  Pursuant to the Agreement, PennyGrab granted to the Company an exclusive, transferable (including sublicensable)
worldwide perpetual license of the Licensed Technology, to make, use, lease, and sell products incorporating the Licensed Technology
(the  Licensed Products ). The Company is required to pay to PennyGrab royalty payments equal to $100 per year.  

 On September 23, 2014 we filed an 8-K
regarding a change in shell Company Status as we were no longer to be deemed a shell Company as we had more than nominal operations.
There are currently no outstanding comments in regards to the 8-K filed and as of today we are no longer deemed to be a shell Company. 

On April 6, 2015 the Company completed
a reverse stock split in which every eight shares of common stock became one share of common stock.

Our Business   

Vapetek  is
a company engaged in developing, marketing and selling electronic cigarettes  ( e-cig ) ,
e-liquids, rechargeable batteries and vapor devices in  the emerging growth e-cigarette industry. The Company s
business product mix currently stands at 25% e-liquids and 75% devices, which consist of e-cig, rechargeable batteries and vapor
devices. Thus far all of our revenues have been from the sale of 3 products: The Vapetek Liquivape e-Liquid, 1100 mAh Vapetek Batteries
and our DA Blaster product. 

 All of our products are U.S.
pharmacopeia (USP) grade which means our e-liquids meet the product quality and standards set by The United States Pharmacopeial
Convention, a non-profit organization that publishes food ingredients and dietary supplements. Food ingredients, flavorings and
colorings, are reviewed by the USP and these standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help ensure that these
products are of appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity and consistency.  

 The Company  has
positioned itself as a company focused on the adoption of electronic vaporizing cigarettes (commonly known as  e-cigarettes )
by the world s 1.2 Billion smokers. The Company  provides high quality e-cigarette devices, electronic refillable
and rechargeable atomizers and e-liquids offering a much safer alternative delivery system for nicotine. There are an estimated
300,000,000 people in the United States, with approximately 28% or 84,000,000 of the population classified as active cigarette
smokers. 

A key proposition of an e-cigarette
is that it eliminates odor. One of the top reasons people  hate smokers  is the smell of the burning cigarette. The
Smoker smells bad, their clothes smell bad, and their breath smells bad, as well as the health issues associated with second hand
smoke. The Electronic Cigarettes we are bringing to market deliver the nicotine through atomizing cartridges containing nicotine
and water. This allows the Nicotine to be delivered through the lungs with Water Vapor, eliminating most all the health issues
related to smoking a traditional cigarette (Examples include tar and over 4000 Carcinogenic Chemicals). The Electronic Cigarette
also eliminates the smell, stink and ash associated with the burning of traditional cigarettes. 

Currently
the Company has customers both domestically and overseas in Japan. It should be noted that the Company expects to continue developing
domestic and international sales of its products in markets that it considers to be emerging for e-cigarette devices and products.  As
of this time we are researching potential targets in which to expand our reach, but we do not have concrete overseas expansion
plans at this time. 

 *All of our current products are third
party products created by third party manufacturers branded under our own trademark. 

Results of operations for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   

Revenues   

 Our sales revenue was $61,069 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $10,395 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Currently, approximately
25.6% and 100% of the revenue was from one related party for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase in revenue is due to revenue generated from new customers.

 Our cost of sales was $40,225 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,129 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is related
to the increase in sales volume. At the same time, we have been able to increase the margin on sales of electronic cigarettes or
 e-cigs , e-cig attachments, customizable devices, and e-liquid cartridges by increasing the volume of our inventory
purchases. 

Operating Expenses   

 Our operating expenses increased by
$503,680 to $517,412 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $13,732 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in expenses is primarily due increased professional fees and other expenses related to our reporting requirements
as a public company. In addition, in the current period we recognized $500,000 of non-cash expense for stock issued to our officers. 

Other expense   

 During the three months ended September

Net Loss   

 We recorded a net loss of $501,525 for

Revenues   

 Our sales revenue was $147,786 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $39,675 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Currently, approximately
16.8% and 93.4% of the revenue was from one related party for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase in revenue is due to revenue generated from new customers. 

Cost of Sales   

 Our cost of sales was $80,009 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22,758 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is related
to the increase in sales volume. At the same time, we have been able to increase the margin on sales of electronic cigarettes or

 Our operating expenses increased by
$515,446 to $576,019 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $60,573 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in expenses is primarily due to increased professional fees and other expenses related to our reporting requirements as
a public company. In addition, in the current period we recognized $500,000 of non-cash expense for stock issued to our officers. 

Other expense   

 During the nine months ended September

Net Loss   

 We recorded a net loss of $541,955 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $43,656 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in net loss can be attributed to the loss on investment and the non-cash stock for services expense. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flows   

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 we used $34,155 for operating activities, $33,713 in investing activities and netted $63,000 from financing activities.

loaned the Company $5,000 for general operating expenses. The loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, payable on demand, and due
no later than April 17, 2020. As of September 30, 2016, this loan is still outstanding. 

As of September 30, 2016, we have insufficient
cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months and insufficient cash to achieve our business goals.
The success of our business plan beyond the next 12 months is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing. We intend to fund
operations through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working
capital, or other cash requirements. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sales of stock or the advancement
or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms,
or at all.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   

The
Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated
retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks,
contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company.   

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation
of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
and the Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company s management
to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of this Form 10-Q describes the significant
accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may
differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. 

Management
believes the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and
impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment
cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical
because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and operating results, and they require
management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. 

Going Concern  

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and had accumulated a deficit
of $629,219 as of September 30, 2016.  The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities.  The
Company s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of
additional financing, the successful development of the Company s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately,
to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve
these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties. 

In order to
mitigate the risk related with this uncertainty, the Company plans to issue additional shares of common stock for cash and services
during the next 12 months.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company's disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end
of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our company's management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated. 

We plan to take steps to enhance and
improve the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form
10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement
the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional
qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon
our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such
funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 

Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
