  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  
  (unaudited)  

NOTE 1:        
 
      ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS       
     
  OmniComm Systems, Inc. ( OmniComm  or the  Company ) is a healthcare technology company that provides web-based electronic data capture ( EDC ) solutions and related value-added services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, contract research organizations ( CROs ), and other clinical trial sponsors principally located in the United States and Europe as well as in East Asia. Our proprietary EDC software applications; TrialMaster     , TrialOne     , eClinical Suite, and Promasys    (the  EDC Software ) allow clinical trial sponsors and investigative sites to securely collect, validate, transmit and analyze clinical trial data.   
     
  Our ability to compete within the EDC industry is predicated on our ability to continue enhancing and broadening the scope of solutions offered through our EDC Software and services. Our research and product development efforts are focused on developing new and complementary software solutions, as well as enhancing our existing software solutions through the addition of increased functionality. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 we spent $1,946,737 and $2,018,638, respectively, on research and product development activities, which are primarily comprised of salaries to our developers and other research and product development personnel and related costs associated with the development of our software products.  

NOTE 2:    
 
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        
     
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION    
     
  The Company s accounts include those of all its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are more fully described in the Company s 2015 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have been prepared in conformity with (i) accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; and (ii) the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.   
     
    UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The results for the periods indicated are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normally recurring adjustments) which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of operating results.   
     
  The operating results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year-ended December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015.   
     
    ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
     
  The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Significant estimates incorporated in our financial statements include the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimate of the appropriate amortization period of our intangible assets, the evaluation of whether our intangible assets have suffered any impairment, the allocation of revenues under multiple-element customer contracts, royalty-based patent liabilities, the value of derivatives associated with debt issued by the Company and the valuation of any corresponding discount to the issuance of our debt. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  
  (unaudited)   
     
    Reclassifications    
     
  Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2015 financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications did not have any effect on our net income/(loss) or shareholders  deficit.  
     
    foreign currency translation    
     
  The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 830-30,  Foreign Currency Matters Translation of Financial Statements . The reporting currency for the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company s subsidiaries, OmniComm Europe GmbH in Germany, OmniComm Spain S.L. in Spain and OmniComm Systems B.V. in the Netherlands is the Euro. The functional currency of the Company s subsidiary, OmniComm Ltd. in the United Kingdom, is the British Pound Sterling. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated using an average rate of exchange during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income/(loss) as a separate component of stockholders  equity. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are primarily related to intercompany accounts that have been determined to be temporary in nature and accordingly, are recorded directly to the statement of operations. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders  equity. We recorded translation losses of $25,567 and $87,970 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.   
     
    REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY         
     
  The Company derives revenues from software licenses and services of its EDC products and services which can be purchased on a stand-alone basis. License revenues are derived principally from the sale of term licenses for the following software products offered by the Company:  TrialMaster, TrialOne  ,   eClinical Suite    and  Promasys.  Service revenues are derived principally from the Company's delivery of the hosted solutions of its  TrialMaster  and  eClinical Suite  software products, and consulting services and customer support, including training, for all of the Company's products.   
     
  The Company recognizes revenues when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of fees is probable; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.   
     
  The Company operates in one reportable segment which is the delivery of EDC Software and services to clinical trial sponsors. The Company segregates its revenues based on the activity cycle used to generate its revenues. Accordingly, revenues are currently generated through four main activities  , including hosted applications, licensing, professional services and maintenance-related services.   
     
    Hosted Application Revenues    
     
  The Company offers its  TrialMaster  and  eClinical Suite  software products as hosted application solutions delivered through a standard web-browser, with customer support and training services. The Company's  TrialOne  and  Promasys  solutions are presently available on a licensed basis. To date, hosted applications revenues have been primarily related to  TrialMaster    and  eClinical Suite .   
     
  Revenues resulting from  TrialMaster  and  eClinical Suite  application hosting services consist of three components of services for each clinical trial. The first component is comprised of application set up, including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks, installation and server configuration of the system. The second component involves application hosting and related support services as well as billable change orders which consist of amounts billed to customers for functionality changes made. The third component involves services required to close out, or lock, the database for the clinical trial.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  
  (unaudited)  
   
  Fees charged for the trial system design, set up and implementation are amortized and recognized ratably over the estimated hosting period. Work performed outside the original scope of work is contracted for separately as an additional fee and is generally recognized ratably over the remaining term of the hosting period. Fees for the first and third stages of the service are typically billed based upon milestones. Revenues earned upon completion of a contractual milestone are deferred and recognized over the estimated remaining hosting period. Fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are generally billed monthly or quarterly in advance. Revenues resulting from hosting services for the  eClinical Suite  products consist of installation and server configuration, application hosting and related support services. Revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the service.   
     
    Licensing Revenues    
     
  The Company's software license revenues are earned from the sale of off-the-shelf software. From time-to-time a client might require significant modification or customization subsequent to delivery to the customer. The Company generally enters into software term licenses for its EDC Software products with its customers for three to five year periods, although customers have entered into both longer and shorter term license agreements. These arrangements typically include multiple elements: software license, consulting services and customer support. The Company bills its customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Generally, the Company bills license fees in advance for each billing cycle of the license term, which typically is either on a quarterly or annual basis. Payment terms are generally net 30 days.   
     
  The Company has sold perpetual licenses for EDC Software products in certain situations to existing customers with the option to purchase customer support, and may, in the future, do so for new customers based on customer requirements or market conditions. The Company has established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the customer support. Accordingly, license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying support arrangement. The Company generates customer support and maintenance revenues from its perpetual license customer base.   
     
    Professional Services    
     
  The Company may also enter into arrangements to provide consulting services separate from a license arrangement. In these situations, revenue is recognized on a time-and-materials basis. Professional services can be deemed to be as essential to the functionality of the software at inception and typically are for initial trial configuration, implementation planning, loading of software, building simple interfaces, running test data and documentation of procedures. Subsequent additions or extensions to license terms do not generally include additional professional services.   
     
    Pass-through Revenue and Expense    
     
  The Company accounts for pass-through revenue and expense (reimbursable revenue and reimbursable expense) in accordance with ASC 605-45,  Principal Agent Considerations    ( ASC 605-45 ). In accordance with ASC 605-45 these amounts are recorded as revenue in the statement of operations with a corresponding expense recorded in cost of goods sold. Pass-through revenues and expenses include amounts associated with third-party services provided to our customers by our service and product partners. These third-party services are primarily comprised of Interactive Voice and Web Response software services (IVR and IWR), travel and shipping that are incurred on our clients  behalf.   
     
    Maintenance Revenues    
     
  Maintenance includes telephone-based help desk support and software maintenance. The Company generally bundles customer support with the software license for the entire term of the arrangement. As a result, the Company generally recognizes revenues for both maintenance and software licenses ratably over the term of the software license and support arrangement. The Company allocates the revenues recognized for these arrangements to the different elements based on management's estimate of the relative fair value of each element. The Company generally invoices each of the elements based on separately quoted amounts and thus has a fairly accurate estimate of the relative fair values of each of the invoiced revenue elements.

  (unaudited)  
   
  The fees associated with each business activity for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, are:  

COST OF REVENUES    
     
  Cost of revenues primarily consists of costs related to hosting, maintaining and supporting the Company s application suite and delivering professional services and support. These costs include salaries, benefits, and bonuses for the Company s professional services staff. Cost of revenues also includes outside service provider costs .      Cost of revenues is expensed as incurred.   
     
    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS    
     
  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less. The carrying amount reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.  
     
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE    
     
  Accounts receivable are judged as to collectability by management and an allowance for bad debts is established as necessary. The allowance is based on an evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivable and prior bad debt experience. The Company had recorded an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of $150,148 as of September 30, 2016 and $116,834 as of December 31, 2015.

  (unaudited)   
   
  The following table summarizes activity in the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts for the periods presented.  

Concentration of Credit Risk    
     
  Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are deposited with major financial institutions and, at times, such balances with any one financial institution may be in excess of FDIC-insured limits. As of September 30, 2016, $897,076 was deposited in excess of FDIC-insured limits. Management believes the risk in these situations to be minimal.  
     
  Except as follows, the Company has no significant off-balance-sheet risk or credit risk concentrations. Financial instruments that subject the Company to potential credit risks are principally cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Concentrated credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to creditworthy customers. The Company's customers are principally located in the United States and Europe as well as in East Asia. The Company is directly affected by the overall financial condition of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries and management believes that credit risk exists and that any credit risk the Company faces has been adequately reserved for as of September 30, 2016. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on accounts past due according to contractual terms and historical collection experience. Actual losses  , when incurred  , are charged to the allowance. The Company's losses related to collection of accounts receivable have consistently been within management's expectations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company believes no additional credit risk exists beyond the amounts provided for in our allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company evaluates its allowance for uncollectable accounts on a quarterly basis based on a specific review of receivable aging and the period that any receivables are beyond the standard payment terms. The Company does not require collateral from its customers in order to mitigate credit risk.   
     
  One customer accounted for 18% of our revenues during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 or approximately $3,028,000. One customer accounted for 15% of our revenues during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 or approximately $2,232,000. The following table summarizes the number of customers who individually comprise greater than 10% of total revenue and/or total accounts receivable and their aggregate percentage of the Company's total revenue and gross accounts receivable for the periods presented.   

The table below provides revenues from European customers for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

  The Company serves all of its hosting customers from third-party web hosting facilities located in the United States. The Company does not control the operation of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption. The Company maintains redundant systems that can be used to provide service in the event the third-party web hosting facilities become unavailable, although in such circumstances, the Company's service may be interrupted during the transition.   
     
    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT    
     
  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset s estimated useful life, which is 5 years for leasehold improvements, computers, equipment and furniture and 3 years for software. Gains or losses on disposal are charged to operations.  
     
    ASSET IMPAIRMENT    
     
    Acquisitions and Intangible Assets       
     
  We account for acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805,  Business Combinations  ( ASC 805 ) and   ASC 350,  Intangibles- Goodwill and Other  ( ASC 350 ). The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition.   
     
  The judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following an asset acquisition. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.   
     
    Long-lived Assets       
     
  We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset s residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. We use quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals and management estimates of future operating cash flows, as appropriate, to determine fair value.   
     
    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT    
     
  OmniComm s capital structure includes the use of warrants and convertible debt features that are classified as derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value under ASC 815  ,  Derivatives and Hedging  ( ASC 815 )   .  ASC 815 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments with no hedging designation be recognized as gains/(losses) in the earnings statement. The fair value measurement is determined in accordance with ASC 820  ,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    ( ASC 820 ).  
     
    DEFERRED REVENUE    
     
  Deferred revenue represents cash advances and amounts in accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date received in excess of revenue earned on on-going contracts. Payment terms vary with each contract but may include an initial payment at the time the contract is executed, with future payments dependent upon the completion of certain contract phases or targeted milestones. In the event of contract cancellation, the Company is generally entitled to payment for all work performed through the point of cancellation. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $9,445,986 in deferred revenues relating to contracts for services to be performed over periods ranging from one month to 5 years. The Company had $6,880,221 in deferred revenues that are expected to be recognized in the next twelve fiscal months.

Advertising costs were $563,803 and $513,754 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and are included under selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES    
     
  Software development costs are expensed as incurred. ASC 985-20,  Software Industry Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased or Marketed  ( ASC 985-20 ), requires the capitalization of certain development costs of software to be sold once technological feasibility is established, which the Company defines as completion to the point of marketability. The capitalized cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of such software has been short and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been immaterial. Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs under ASC 985-20. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 we spent $1,946,737 and $2,018,638, respectively, on research and product development activities, which include costs associated with the development of our software products and services for our clients  projects and which are primarily comprised of salaries and related expenses for our software developers and consulting fees paid to third-party consultants. Research and product development costs are primarily included under Salaries, benefits and related taxes in our Statement of Operations.   
     
    EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS    
     
  The OmniComm Systems, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ) was approved at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on June 16, 2016. The 2016 Plan provides for the issuance of up to   10,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan shall automatically increase on January 1st of each year for a period of nine (9) years commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2025, in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the total number of shares authorized under the 2016 Plan  .   
     
  The predecessor plan, the OmniComm Systems, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ) was approved at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on July 10, 2009 and terminated on June 16, 2016 upon the approval of the 2016 Plan. The 2009 Plan provided for the issuance of up to 7,500,000 shares to employees, directors and key consultants. The 2016 and 2009 Plans are more fully described in  Note 13, Employee Equity Incentive Plans .   
     
  The Company accounts for its employee equity incentive plans under   ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , ( ASC 718 ) which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company currently uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine grant date fair value.  
     
    EARNINGS PER SHARE    
     
  The Company accounts for Earnings per Share using ASC 260,  Earnings per Share    ,  ( ASC 260 )  . Unlike diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities.

    INCOME TAXES    
     
  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,  Income Taxes    ( ASC 740 )   .  ASC 740 has as its basic objective the recognition of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon all events that have been recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of the enacted tax laws.   
     
  Valuation allowances are established  , when necessary  , to reduce deferred tax assets to the estimated amount to be realized. Income tax expense represents the tax payable for the current period and the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.  
     
    IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    
     
  During the first nine months of 2016, we adopted the following new accounting pronouncements:  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting standard update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , ( ASU 2016-02 ). This ASU requires that an entity should recognize assets and liabilities for leases with a maximum possible term of more than 12 months. A lessee would recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the leased asset (the underlying asset) for the lease term. This guidance also provides accounting updates with respect to lessor accounting under a lease arrangement. This new lease guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified approach (cumulative effect adjustment in period of adoption) to adopt the new guidance. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance in our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued   ASU No. 2016-09  ,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ,    ( ASU 2016-09 ). This     guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the full impact of the new standard.  
     
  Accounting standards-setting organizations frequently issue new or revised accounting rules. We regularly review all new pronouncements to determine their impact, if any, on our financial statements.  

NOTE 3:    
 
     EARNINGS/    (LOSS) PER SHARE        
     
  Basic earnings/(loss) per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding of 145,257,206 and 92,226,109 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
  The outstanding share balance as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, includes 1,476,683 and 2,316,688 restricted shares that have been issued but are still at risk of forfeiture as the restrictions have not lapsed.

  To satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development and marketing programs. If we are successful in obtaining additional financings, the terms of such financings may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our securities or result in increased interest expense in future periods.

On June 30, 2016, the Company issued promissory notes in the principal amount of $372  ,500 and warrants to purchase 1,490,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.25 per share with an expiration date of April 1, 2020 to two investors, in exchange for existing promissory notes in the same amount. The notes carry an interest rate of 12% per annum and have a maturity date of April 1, 2020.   
     
  This issuance caused us to calculate and record a derivative liability for the warrant liability. The warrants were valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model. A value of $246,921 was calculated and allocated to the warrants and recorded as a liability to the issuance of the note payable. As a result of the liability we recorded a discount to the note payable. The carrying amount of the note at the time of issuance was therefore $125,579. The warrant liability (discount) will be amortized over the 45 month duration of the note payables. The Company will continue to perform a fair value calculation quarterly on the warrant liability and accordingly the warrant liability is increased or decreased based on the fair value calculation. The resulting increase or decrease is reflected in operations as an unrealized gain or loss on changes in derivative liabilities.

  On April 1, 2015 the Company and the holders extended the maturity date of $50,000 of convertible debentures originally issued in December 2009.

NOTE      9  :     
 
    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT        
       
  The Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities under the guidance of ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but its provisions apply to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement.   
     
  ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 requires the Company to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:  

Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  

Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated inputs; and     

Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or liabilities.     
     
   The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:  

A.     
 
   Market approach  - Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities     

B.     
 
   Income approach  - Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts, including present value techniques, option-pricing models and excess earnings methods     

C.     
 
   Cost approach  - Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost)

  The Company also adopted the provisions of ASC 825,  Financial Instruments  ( ASC 825 ). ASC 825   allows companies to choose to measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings. Fair value treatment may be elected either upon initial recognition of an eligible asset or liability or, for an existing asset or liability, if an event triggers a new basis of accounting. The Company did not elect to re-measure any of its existing financial assets or liabilities under the provisions of this Statement. The Company elected the fair value option for the issuance of warrants associated with the promissory notes issued in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  
     
  The Company s financial assets or liabilities subject to ASC 820 as of September 30, 2016 include the conversion feature and warrant liability associated with convertible debentures issued during 2008 and 2009 and the warrants issued during 2011 and 2016 that are associated with notes payable. The conversion feature and warrants were deemed to be derivatives (the  Derivative Instruments ) since a fixed conversion price cannot be determined for either of the Derivative Instruments due to anti-dilution provisions embedded in the offering documents for the convertible debentures. The derivative instruments were not issued for risk management purposes and as such are not designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of ASC 815  ,  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . See Note 8   Convertible Notes Payable.   
     
  Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to determine the fair value of the Company s financial liabilities including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  
     
  A summary as of September 30, 2016 of the fair value of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows:  

(1) The fair value of the derivative instruments was estimated using the Income Approach and the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for the period ended September 30, 2016    

(2) The fair value at the measurement date is equal to the carrying value on the balance sheet

  A summary as of December 31, 2015 of the fair value of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring ba s is follows:  

(1) The fair value of the derivative instruments was estimated using the Income Approach and the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2015    

(2) The fair value at the measurement date is equal to the carrying value on the balance sheet     

A summary as of September 30, 2016 of the fair value of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis follows:  

(3) The fair value of the acquired assets was estimated using the Income Approach with a discounted cash flow valuation methodology applied.    

(4) The acquired Promasys B.V. software code, customer list and URLs/website are not measured on a recurring basis since their initial fair value has been deemed to have a finite life and is being amortized periodically. Instead the Company performs an impairment analysis on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether the carrying value of the assets reflects the fair value of the assets in a market based transaction.     
     
  Other identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. The Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Asset subsection of ASC 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment  requires us to test the recoverability of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In testing for potential impairment, if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment, if any.

   PATENT LITIGATION SETTLEMENT   
     
  Effective April 9, 2009, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with DataSci, LLC ( DataSci ). DataSci granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive non-transferable right and license under the Licensed Patent and the right to sublicense TrialMaster on a Technology Transfer and Technology Transition basis. Under the terms of the license, we are obligated to pay royalties quarterly for sales of Licensed Products, as defined therein, from January 1, 2009 until the expiration of the Licensed Patent equal to two percent (2%) of OmniComm s annual Gross Revenues or, alternatively, the annual minimum royalty payment(s), whichever is greater.  In addition to the payment of royalties, the Settlement and Licensing Agreement imposes certain obligations on us including commercialization, certain sublicensing, other payments, insurance, and confidentiality. In addition and as a license fee for past use of the Licensed Patent which may have occurred prior to the effective date of the Settlement and Licensing Agreement, we issued a warrant to DataSci to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $.01 per share. The Settlement and Licensing Agreement provides that upon the expiration date of the warrant, at DataSci s sole discretion, DataSci shall exercise its option under the warrant or licensee shall pay DataSci $300,000. The warrant is exercisable commencing on the second anniversary of the Settlement and Licensing Agreement, April 2, 2011, through the expiration date of the warrant, deemed to be on the termination date of the Settlement and Licensing Agreement on May 12, 2018.   
     
  On June 23, 2009, we entered into an agreement to acquire the EDC assets of eResearch Technology. Concurrent with the consummation of that transaction we entered into the First Amendment to Settlement and Licensing Agreement with DataSci, (i) to include the eResearch Technology EDC assets acquired within the definition of Licensed Products, and as such subject to the royalty payment(s), under and in accordance with the Settlement and Licensing Agreement, and (ii) provide a release by DataSci of any and all claims of infringement of the Licensed Patent in connection with the eResearch Technology EDC assets acquired which may have occurred prior to the effective date of the First Amendment to Settlement and Licensing Agreement for an aggregate amount of $300,000.  
     
  The remaining minimum royalty payments per year are as follows:  

During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 the Company recorded a charge to earnings of $74,579 and $93,612, respectively, which amounts represent (i) the amount of additional license expense incurred above the stipulated minimum in the DataSci License Agreement during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and (ii) the accretion of the difference between the total stipulated annual minimum royalty payments and the recorded present value accrual of the annual minimum royalty payments.

    Stock Option Plan    s    
     
   Description of 20  16   Equity Incentive Plan   
     
  In 2016, the Company s Board of Directors and shareholders approved the OmniComm Systems, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ). The 2016 Plan provides for granting Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Phantom Stock Unit Awards and Performance Share Units. The 2016 Plan provides for the issuance of up to   10,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance upon awards granted under the 2016 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan shall automatically increase on January 1st of each year for a period of nine (9) years commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2025, in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the total number of shares authorized under the 2016 Plan  . Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the 2016 Plan shall terminate on June 29, 2026.  
     
  The maximum term for any option grant under the 2016 Plan is ten years from the date of the grant; however, options granted under the 2016 Plan will generally expire five years from the date of grant. Options granted to employees generally vest either upon grant or in two installments. The first vesting, which is equal to 50% of the granted stock options, usually occurs upon completion of one full year of employment from the date of grant and the second vesting usually occurs on the second anniversary of the date of grant. The vesting period typically begins on the date of hire for new employees and on the date of grant for existing employees. The restrictions on restricted shares granted to employees generally lapse in three equal annual installments on the anniversary of the date of grant.  Any unvested stock options or restricted shares with restrictions that have not lapsed that are granted under the 2016 Plan are forfeited and expire upon termination of employment.

The weighted average fair value (per share) of options granted during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $0.19 and $0.24 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The Black Scholes option-pricing model was utilized to calculate these values.  
     
   Basis for Fair Value Estimate of Share-Based Payments    
     
  Based on analysis of its historical volatility, the Company expects that the future volatility of its share price is likely to be similar to the historical volatility the Company experienced since the Company s commercialization activities were initiated during the second half of 2000. The Company used a volatility calculation utilizing the Company s own historical volatility to estimate its future volatility for purposes of valuing the share-based payments that have been granted. Actual volatility, and future changes in estimated volatility, may differ substantially from the Company s current estimates.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
     
    General     
     
  The following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein and other information set forth in this report.  
     
    Forward-Looking Statements    
     
  Statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not historical fact are "forward-looking statements". These statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "estimate", "project", "believe", "expect", "may", "will", "should", "intends", or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. We wish to caution the reader that these forward-looking statements, contained in this Form 10-Q regarding matters that are not historical facts, are only predictions and are based on information available at the time and/or management s good faith belief with respect to future events.   No assurance can be given that plans for the future will be consummated or that the future results indicated, whether expressed or implied, will be achieved. While sometimes presented with numerical specificity, these plans and projections and other forward-looking statements are based upon a variety of assumptions, which we consider reasonable, but which nevertheless may not be realized. Because of the number and range of the assumptions underlying our projections and forward-looking statements, many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond our reasonable control, some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this Form 10-Q. Therefore, our actual experience and results achieved during the period covered by any particular projections or forward-looking statements may differ substantially from those projected. Consequently, the inclusion of projections and other forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that these plans will be consummated or that estimates and projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially. There can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made.   The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement made by it or on its behalf, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  
     
    Overview    
     
  We are a healthcare technology company that provides web-based electronic data capture ( EDC ) solutions and related value-added services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, clinical research organizations ( CROs ), and other clinical trial sponsors worldwide. Our proprietary EDC software applications: TrialMaster   ; TrialOne   ; eClinical Suite and Promasys    (the  EDC Software ), allow clinical trial sponsors and investigative sites to securely collect, validate, transmit and analyze clinical trial data electronically ( eClinical )  .  
     
  In 2016, the primary focus of our strategy includes:  

Increasing our penetration of the Phase I trial market with our dedicated Phase I solution, TrialOne    

Stimulating demand by providing clinical trial sponsors with high value eClinical applications and services  

Expanding our penetration of the large pharmaceutical sponsor market  

Broadening our suite of services and software applications on an organic research and product development basis and on a selective basis via the acquisition or licensing of complementary solutions  

Expanding our business development efforts in Europe and East Asia to capitalize on our operational and clinical capabilities vis- -vis our competition in that geographic market   
        
  Our operating focus is first, to increase our sales and marketing capabilities and penetration rate and secondly, to continue developing and improving our software solutions and services to ensure our services and products remain an attractive, high-value EDC choice.  Our ability to compete within the EDC and eClinical industries is predicated on our ability to continue enhancing and broadening the scope of solutions we offer. Our research and product development efforts are focused on developing new, complementary software solutions, as well as enhancing our existing software solutions through the addition of increased functionality. We spent $1,946,737 and $2,018,638 on research and product development activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  The majority of these expenses represent salaries and related benefits to our developers which include the costs associated with the continued development of our EDC Software applications to meet current customer requirements and with our efforts at enhancing our suite of products by incorporating new features and services we believe will improve the products and consequently improve our market position. Our research and product development team is comprised of software programmers, engineers and related support personnel.    

38

Our clients are able to partially or completely license our EDC solutions. The licensing business model provides our clients with a more cost effective means of deploying our EDC solutions on a large-scale basis. Our licensed products, falling under the auspices of either a Tech Transition (partial transfer with some services performed by OmniComm) or Tech Transfer, allows us to broaden our potential client base, provides us with a high-margin revenue source and affords us the ability to improve our competitive position within the EDC industry.    
     
  We feel that the momentum established from new client acquisitions in 2015 and year to date 2016 and our ability to retain clients for repeat engagements provide a good operating base from which to build during the remainder of 2016  .  We increased the marketing and business development budget for our TrialOne product during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016 as we place increased emphasis on increasing our penetration of the Phase I market in the U.S. and Europe as well as in East Asia. We believe that segment of the EDC market is the least penetrated and allows for the greatest potential increases in market share and in sales volumes.  We expect to continue increasing the level of resources deployed in our sales and marketing efforts through the addition of sales personnel and by increasing the number of industry tradeshows and conferences that we attend. We feel that a combination of our existing infrastructure, broadened array of eClinical products and services and increased success in new client acquisition, coupled with our ability to retain our existing clients will allow us to compete effectively within the EDC market.    
     
    The     nine months ended September 30, 2016     compared     to     the     nine months ended September 30, 2015    
     
   Results of Operations   
     
  A summarized version of our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 is included in the table below.  

39

The table below provides a comparison of our recognized revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  .  

Overall revenue increased by $1,996,515 or 13  .1%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of increases in software licenses, professional services, and change orders.     
     
  We recorded revenue of $13,036,982 including $4,891,415 from set-up fees and $2,294,550 from maintenance revenues associated with our TrialMaster suite during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $10,495,035 that included $4,930,454 in set-up fees and $2,384,000 in maintenance revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      
     
  We recorded $1,162,276 in revenues associated with clients using the eClinical Suite during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $1,352,585 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  eClinical Suite revenues are primarily comprised of license subscriptions and revenues associated with our hosting and maintenance services.     
     
  We recorded $820,979 in revenues in maintenance and $179,492 from hosting activities associated with the eClinical Suite during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $941,336 from maintenance and $194,117 from hosting activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Generally, these revenues are paid quarterly and are connected to hosting and client support for clients licensing the eClinical Suite.  
     
  We recorded revenue of $2,353,213 including $996,406 from software licensing and $1,028,576 from professional services associated with clients utilizing our TrialOne EDC software for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $2,861,890 including $1,496,453 from software licensing and $948,595 from professional services for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   We are continuing to enhance our efforts at developing our sales and marketing campaign for the TrialOne application.  TrialOne revenues are primarily comprised of license subscriptions and maintenance services  .  
     
  We recorded revenue of $480,783 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 including $131,205 from software licensing and $245,722 from maintenance associated with clients utilizing the Promasys EDC solution as compared to revenue of $561,385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 including $178,883 from software licensing and $272,582 from maintenance.   
     
  Our TrialMaster EDC application has historically been sold on an application service provider ( ASP ) basis that provides EDC and other services such as an enterprise management suite which assists our clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in accelerating the completion of clinical trials. During 2009 we completed the acquisition of the eResearch EDC Assets and TrialOne and in 2013 we acquired Promasys (collectively the  Acquired Software ).  These software applications have historically been sold on a licensed or technology transfer basis.  As we continue developing our software applications and our client relationships mature, we expect some of our clients to deploy TrialMaster on a licensed, rather than ASP hosted basis. We expect the Acquired Software applications to continue to be sold primarily on a licensed basis.  
     
  TrialMaster contracts for ASP services provide for pricing that is based on both the size and duration of the clinical trial. Size parameters include the number of case report forms used to collect data and the number of sites utilizing TrialMaster. The client will pay a trial setup fee at the beginning of a project based on the previously mentioned factors and then pay an on-going maintenance fee for the duration of the clinical trial that provides software, network and site support during the trial.  
     
  Generally, ASP contracts will range in duration from one month to several years. ASP setup fees are generally recognized in accordance with ASC   605,   Revenue Recognition  , which requires that the revenues be recognized ratably over the life of the contract. ASP maintenance fee revenues are earned and recognized monthly. Costs associated with contract revenues are recognized as incurred.  
     
  License contracts are typically sold on a subscription basis that takes into account system usage both on a data volume and system user basis.  Pricing includes additional charges for consulting services associated with the installation, validation, training and deployment of our eClinical software and solutions.  Licensed contracts of the eClinical Suite have historically been sold both on a term and on a perpetual license basis with hosting and maintenance charges being paid quarterly.  The Company expects any licenses it sells of its software products to be sold under three to five year term licenses.

Our top five customers accounted for approximately 36% of our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and approximately 35% of our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  One customer accounted for approximately 18% of our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   One customer accounted for approximately 15% of our revenues the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The loss of any of these contracts or these customers in the future could adversely affect our results of operations.    
     
  Cost of goods sold increased approximately 10% or $339,610 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Cost of goods sold were approximately 22% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 22% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of goods sold relates primarily to (i) salaries and related benefits associated with the programmers, developers and systems analysts producing clinical trials on behalf of our clients and (ii) the costs associated with pass-through revenues (reimbursable revenues). Cost of goods sold increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in pass-through expenses (reimbursable expenses). The pass-through revenue and expense primarily relate to specific work being performed for a few clients. At this time we do not expect the volume of the pass-through revenue and expense to grow significantly and therefore we do not expect any significant degradation of our gross margin  .  
     
  Overall, total operating expenses increased approximately 2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in operating expenses is primarily the result of an increase in salaries, benefits and related taxes.   
     
  Salaries and related expenses were our biggest operating expense at 71% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 71% of total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Salaries and related expenses increased by 3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015  .  The table below provides a summary of the significant components of salary and related expenses by primary cost category.  

As of September 30, 2016, we employed 127 employees world-wide as follows: 59 employees out of our headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 10 employees out of a regional operating office in Somerset, New Jersey, 22 field employees located throughout the United States, our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Europe, GmbH, employs 18 employees in Bonn, Germany, our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Ltd., employs 10 employees in Southampton, England, our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Spain, S. L. employs 2 employees in Barcelona, Spain, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Systems B.V. employs 4 employees in the Netherlands and 2 employees in Japan. We believe that relations with our employees are good.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we incurred $168,873 and $181,617, respectively, in salary expense in connection with  ASC 718   ,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments services from employees. This standard requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.

Rent and related expenses increased by approximately 11% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The table below details the significant portions of our rent expense.  Our primary data site is located at a co-location facility in Cincinnati, Ohio and we will continue utilizing this facility for the foreseeable future since it is designed to ensure 100% production system up-time and to provide system redundancy. We also utilize co-location and disaster recovery space in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida area. This facility provides us with disaster recovery and business continuity services for our operations. In 2015 we added a third co-location facility in Frankfurt, Germany. We currently lease office space in Bonn, Germany for our European subsidiary, OmniComm Europe, GmbH under a lease that expires in July 2017. We currently lease office space for a regional operating office in New Jersey under a lease that expires in March 2021. Our OmniComm Ltd. subsidiary leases office space in Southampton, UK under a lease that expires in September 2017. Our OmniComm Systems B.V. subsidiary leases office space in Leiden, the Netherlands under a lease that expires in October 2018. Our Fort Lauderdale corporate office lease expires in February 2023. The table below provides the significant components of our rent related expenses by location or subsidiary. Included in rent during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was an increase in expense of $77,780 in non-cash, straight line rent recorded to give effect to contractual, inflation-based rent increases in our leases compared to a decrease in expense of $18,969 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Consulting services expense decreased to $111,284 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $226,094 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Consulting services are comprised of fees paid to consultants for help with product development and for services related to our sales and marketing efforts. Sales and marketing related consulting expenses increased year over year due to the utilization of a new consultant in 2016. Product development consulting expenses decreased year over year as the majority of the work being performed by the consultants was completed in 2015. The table provided below provides the significant components of the expenses incurred related to consulting services.   

Legal and professional fees decreased approximately 15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Professional fees include fees paid to our auditors for services rendered on a quarterly and annual basis in connection with our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and fees paid to our attorneys in connection with representation in matters involving litigation and acquisitions or for services rendered to us related to securities and SEC related matters. The table below compares the significant components of our legal and professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) increased by $38,744 or approximately 4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. SG A expenses relate primarily to costs incurred in running our offices in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Somerset, New Jersey, Southampton, England  , Barcelona, Spain, Bonn, Germany and Leiden, the Netherlands on a day-to-day basis and other costs not directly related to other captioned items in our income statement. SG A includes the cost of office equipment and supplies, the costs of attending conferences and seminars and other expenses incurred in the normal course of business. In 2015 we spent approximately $635,000 on marketing, sales and advertising. We expect that the 2016 marketing, sales and advertising expenses will be approximately $850,000 as we increase our attendance at tradeshows and our marketing efforts worldwide  .  
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recognized bad debt expense of $57,862 compared to a credit of $15,038 for bad debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This change was primarily the result of an increase in aged receivable balances that caused us to increase our reserve. During the remainder of 2016 we will continue to carefully and actively manage our potential exposure to bad debt by closely monitoring our accounts receivable and proactively taking the action necessary to limit our exposure.  We have been very successful in managing and collecting our outstanding accounts receivable.  We believe that our current allowance for uncollectible accounts accurately reflects any accounts which may prove uncollectible during the remainder of 2016  .  
     
  Interest expense was $984,890 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,198,250 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,213,360  .  Interest incurred to related parties was $681,063 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,977,778 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Included in interest expense is the accretion of discounts recorded related to financial instrument derivatives that were deemed a part of the financings we undertook in 2008 and 2009 and relating to warrants issued during 2011 and 2016  .  Interest expense decreased year over year primarily due to the November 2015 transactions in which our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Cornelis F. Wit, cancelled $7,300,000 of outstanding debt due to him and 29,363,517 warrants to purchase the Company s stock at $0.25 in exchange for 29,363,517 common shares and converted $1,900,000 of convertible notes into 7,660,000 common shares. The table below provides detail on the significant components of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  .  

We evaluate the cost of capital available to us in combination with our overall capital structure and the prevailing market conditions in deciding what financing best fulfills our short and long-term capital needs. Given the overall economic climate and in particular the difficulties nano-cap companies have experienced in obtaining financing, we believe the structure and terms of the transactions we entered into during 2015 and 2016 were obtained at the best terms available to the Company.   
     
  We record unrealized gains/losses related to changes in our derivative liabilities associated with the issuance of convertible debt that occurred during 2008 and 2009 and warrants associated with promissory notes issued in 2011 and 2016  .  We recorded a net unrealized loss of $3,016,398 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with a net unrealized gain of $6,290,796 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The unrealized gains/losses can be attributed to fair value calculations undertaken periodically on the warrant and conversion feature liabilities recorded by us at the time the convertible debt and promissory notes were issued.  Accordingly the warrant and conversion feature liabilities are increased or decreased based on the fair value calculations made at each quarterly balance sheet date.  These non-cash gains and losses have materially impacted our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and can be reasonably anticipated to materially affect our net loss or net income in future periods. The fair value calculations are heavily reliant on the value of our common stock and on the calculated volatility of the price of our common stock on the OTCQX Marketplace. Accordingly, significant changes in our stock price will create large unrealized gains and losses on our financial statements. We are, however, unable to estimate the amount of such income/expense in future periods as the income/expense is partly based on the market price of our common stock at the end of a future measurement date. In addition, if we issue securities in the future which are classified as derivatives we will incur expense and income items in future periods. Investors are cautioned to consider the impact of this non-cash accounting treatment on our financial statements.

   Results of Operations   
     
  A summarized version of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 is included in the table below.  

44

The table below provides a comparison of our recognized revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  .  

Overall revenue increased by $1,208,542 or 21.6%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of increases in professional services and software licenses.     
     
  We recorded revenue of $4,887,764 including $1,578,682 from set-up fees and $1,529,115 from license revenues associated with our TrialMaster suite during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $3,935,014 that included $2,048,301 in set-up fees and $339,438 in license revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2015.      
     
  We recorded $388,649 in revenues associated with clients using the eClinical Suite during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $415,642 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  eClinical Suite revenues are primarily comprised of license subscriptions and revenues associated with our hosting and maintenance services.     
     
  We recorded $285,993 in revenues from maintenance and $63,775 from hosting activities associated with the eClinical Suite during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $303,570 from maintenance and $63,900 from hosting activities for the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Generally, these revenues are paid quarterly and are connected to hosting and client support for clients licensing the eClinical Suite.  
     
  We recorded revenue of $1,322,480 including $414,333 from software licensing and $764,220 from professional services associated with clients utilizing our TrialOne EDC software for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with revenue of $1,029,293 including $797,724 from software licensing and $39,725 from professional services for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   We are enhancing our efforts at developing our sales and marketing campaign for the TrialOne application.    
     
  We recorded revenue of $139,468 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 including $31,564 from software licensing and $77,326 from maintenance associated with clients utilizing the Promasys EDC solution as compared to revenue of $217,920 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 including $83,960 from software licensing and $92,750 from maintenance.   
     
  Our TrialMaster EDC application has historically been sold on an application service provider ( ASP ) basis that provides EDC and other services such as an enterprise management suite which assists our clients in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in accelerating the completion of clinical trials. During 2009 we completed the acquisition of the eResearch EDC Assets and TrialOne and in 2013 we acquired Promasys (collectively the  Acquired Software ).  These software applications have historically been sold on a licensed or technology transfer basis.  As we continue developing our software applications and our client relationships mature, we expect some of our clients to deploy TrialMaster on a licensed, rather than ASP hosted basis. We expect the Acquired Software applications to continue to be sold primarily on a licensed basis.  
     
  TrialMaster contracts for ASP services provide for pricing that is based on both the size and duration of the clinical trial. Size parameters include the number of case report forms used to collect data and the number of sites utilizing TrialMaster. The client will pay a trial setup fee at the beginning of a project based on the previously mentioned factors and then pay an on-going maintenance fee for the duration of the clinical trial that provides software, network and site support during the trial.  
     
  Generally, ASP contracts will range in duration from one month to several years. ASP setup fees are generally recognized in accordance with ASC   605,   Revenue Recognition  , which requires that the revenues be recognized ratably over the life of the contract. ASP maintenance fee revenues are earned and recognized monthly. Costs associated with contract revenues are recognized as incurred.  

45

License contracts are typically sold on a subscription basis that takes into account system usage both on a data volume and system user basis.  Pricing includes additional charges for consulting services associated with the installation, validation, training and deployment of our eClinical software and solutions.  Licensed contracts of the eClinical Suite have historically been sold both on a term and on a perpetual license basis with hosting and maintenance charges being paid quarterly.  The Company expects any licenses it sells of its software products to be sold under three to five year term licenses.  
     
  Our top five customers accounted for approximately 38% of our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and approximately 38% of our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  One customer accounted for approximately 14% of our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016  .   One customer accounted for approximately 18% of our revenues the three months ended September 30, 2015. The loss of any of these contracts or these customers in the future could adversely affect our results of operations.    
     
  Cost of goods sold increased approximately 19% or $190,832 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Cost of goods sold were approximately 18% of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 18% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of goods sold relates primarily to (i) salaries and related benefits associated with the programmers, developers and systems analysts producing clinical trials on behalf of our clients and (ii) the costs associated with pass-through revenues (reimbursable revenues). Cost of goods sold increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in pass-through expenses (reimbursable expenses). The pass-through revenue and expense primarily relate to specific work being performed for a few clients. At this time we do not expect the volume of the pass-through revenue and expense to grow significantly and therefore we do not expect any significant degradation of our gross margin  .  
     
  Overall, total operating expenses increased approximately 13% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase in operating expenses is primarily the result of increases in and salaries, benefits   related taxes, rent and selling general   administrative expenses.   
     
  Salaries and related expenses were our biggest operating expense at 73% of total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 74% of total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Salaries and related expenses increased by 12% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015  .  The table below provides a summary of the significant components of salary and related expenses by primary cost category.  

As of September 30, 2016, we employed 127 employees world-wide as follows: 59 employees out of our headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 10 employees out of a regional operating office in Somerset, New Jersey, 22 field employees located throughout the United States, our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Europe, GmbH, employs 18 employees in Bonn, Germany, our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Ltd., employs 10 employees in Southampton, England, our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Spain, S. L. employs 2 employees in Barcelona, Spain and our wholly-owned subsidiary, OmniComm Systems B.V. employs 4 employees in the Netherlands and 2 employees in Japan. We believe that relations with our employees are good.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015 we incurred $58,214 and $64,697, respectively, in salary expense in connection with  ASC 718   ,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments services from employees. This standard requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.

Rent and related expenses increased by approximately 24% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The table below details the significant portions of our rent expense.  Our primary data site is located at a co-location facility in Cincinnati, Ohio and we will continue utilizing this facility for the foreseeable future since it is designed to ensure 100% production system up-time and to provide system redundancy. We also utilize co-location and disaster recovery space in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida area. This facility provides us with disaster recovery and business continuity services for our operations. In 2015 we added a third co-location facility in Frankfurt, Germany. We currently lease office space in Bonn, Germany for our European subsidiary, OmniComm Europe, GmbH under a lease that expires in July 2017. We currently lease office space for a regional operating office in New Jersey under a lease that expires in March 2021. Our OmniComm Ltd. subsidiary leases office space in Southampton, UK under a lease that expires in September 2017. Our OmniComm Systems B.V. subsidiary leases office space in Leiden, the Netherlands under a lease that expires in October 2018. Our Fort Lauderdale corporate office lease expires in February 2023. The table below provides the significant components of our rent related expenses by location or subsidiary. Included in rent during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was an increase in expense of $3,516 in non-cash, straight line rent recorded to give effect to contractual, inflation-based rent increases in our leases compared to a decrease in expense of $6,882 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Consulting services expense increased to $63,284 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $49,354 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Consulting services are comprised of fees paid to consultants for help with product development and for services related to our sales and marketing efforts. Sales and marketing related consulting expenses increased year over year due to the utilization of a new consultant in 2016. Product development consulting expenses decreased year over year as the majority of the work being performed by the consultants was completed in 2015. The table provided below provides the significant components of the expenses incurred related to consulting services.   

Legal and professional fees decreased approximately 30% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. Professional fees include fees paid to our auditors for services rendered on a quarterly and annual basis in connection with our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and fees paid to our attorneys in connection with representation in matters involving litigation and acquisitions or for services rendered to us related to securities and SEC related matters. The table below compares the significant components of our legal and professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) increased by $41,576 or approximately 16% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to increases in marketing expenses. SG A expenses relate primarily to costs incurred in running our offices in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Somerset, New Jersey, Southampton, England  , Barcelona, Spain, Bonn, Germany and Leiden, the Netherlands on a day-to-day basis and other costs not directly related to other captioned items in our income statement. SG A includes the cost of office equipment and supplies, the costs of attending conferences and seminars and other expenses incurred in the normal course of business. In 2015 we spent approximately $635,000 on marketing, sales and advertising. We expect that the 2016 marketing, sales and advertising expenses will be approximately $850,000 as we increase our attendance at tradeshows and our marketing efforts worldwide  .  

47

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we recognized a bad debt expense of $24,555 compared to a credit of $9,636 for bad debt for the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This change was primarily the result of an increase in aged receivable balances that caused us to increase our reserve. During the remainder of 2016 we will continue to carefully and actively manage our potential exposure to bad debt by closely monitoring our accounts receivable and proactively taking the action necessary to limit our exposure.  We have been very successful in managing and collecting our outstanding accounts receivable.  We believe that our current allowance for uncollectible accounts accurately reflects any accounts which may prove uncollectible during the remainder of 2016  .  
     
  Interest expense was $365,831 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $752,568 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $386,737  .  Interest incurred to related parties was $237,377 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $677,993 for the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Included in interest expense is the accretion of discounts recorded related to financial instrument derivatives that were deemed a part of the financings we undertook in 2008 and 2009 and relating to warrants issued during 2011 and 2016  .  Interest expense decreased year over year primarily due to the November 2015 transactions in which our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Cornelis F. Wit, cancelled $7,300,000 of outstanding debt due to him and 29,363,517 warrants to purchase the Company s stock at $0.25 in exchange for 29,363,517 common shares and converted $1,900,000 convertible notes into 7,660,000 common shares. The table below provides detail on the significant components of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  .  

We evaluate the cost of capital available to us in combination with our overall capital structure and the prevailing market conditions in deciding what financing best fulfills our short and long-term capital needs. Given the overall economic climate and in particular the difficulties nano-cap companies have experienced in obtaining financing, we believe the structure and terms of the transactions we entered into during 2015 and 2016 were obtained at the best terms available to the Company.   
     
  We record unrealized gains/losses related to changes in our derivative liabilities associated with the issuance of convertible debt that occurred during 2008 and 2009 and warrants associated with promissory notes issued in 2011 and 2016  .  We recorded a net unrealized loss of $557,562 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with a net unrealized gain of $2,217,998 during the three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The unrealized gains/losses can be attributed to fair value calculations undertaken periodically on the warrant and conversion feature liabilities recorded by us at the time the convertible debt and promissory notes were issued.  Accordingly the warrant and conversion feature liabilities are increased or decreased based on the fair value calculations made at each quarterly balance sheet date.  These non-cash gains and losses have materially impacted our results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and can be reasonably anticipated to materially affect our net loss or net income in future periods. The fair value calculations are heavily reliant on the value of our common stock and on the calculated volatility of the price of our common stock on the OTCQX Marketplace. Accordingly, significant changes in our stock price will create large unrealized gains and losses on our financial statements. We are, however, unable to estimate the amount of such income/expense in future periods as the income/expense is partly based on the market price of our common stock at the end of a future measurement date. In addition, in the future if we issue securities which are classified as derivatives we will incur expense and income items in future periods. Investors are cautioned to consider the impact of this non-cash accounting treatment on our financial statements.  
     
  The Company recorded arrearages of $  -0- and $51,989 in its 5% Series A Preferred Stock dividends for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively.   

48

Liq  uidity   and Capital Resources   
     
  Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its operating, investing and financing needs for cash.   We have historically experienced negative cash flows and have relied on the proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities to fund our operations. In addition, we have utilized stock-based compensation as a means of paying for consulting and salary related expenses. At September 30, 2016, we had working capital deficit of $9,768,834.  
     
  The table provided below summarizes key measures of our liquidity and capital resources:  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   
     
  Cash and cash equivalents increased by $405,525 to $1,240,744 at September 30, 2016 from $835,219 at December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily comprised of a net loss of $2,178,830  , changes in working capital accounts of $784,058 and an increase from non-cash transactions of $3,594,479. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had investing activities comprised of net purchases of property and equipment of $220,672. For financing activities, we had net proceeds of $25,000.   
     
   Capital Expenditures   
     
  We are not currently bound by any long or short-term agreements for the purchase or lease of capital expenditures. Any amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately service any increase in our business. To date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future.  

49

Presently, we have approximately $10  0,000 planned for capital expenditures to further develop our infrastructure to allow for growth in our operations during the remainder of 2016  .  We expect to fund these capital expenditure needs through a combination of vendor-provided financing, the use of operating or capital equipment leases and cash provided from operations.  
     
   Contractual Obligations   
     
  The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016:  

1.   
 
  Amounts do not include interest to be paid.     

5.   
 
  Includes $75,000 of 10% convertible notes currently in default and due that are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion rate of $1.25 per share.     

9.   
 
  Includes office lease obligations for our Corporate Office in Florida, our regional operating office in New Jersey, our co-location and disaster recovery locations in Ohio, Florida and Frankfurt, Germany, our office in England, our office in Leiden, the Netherlands and our European headquarters in Bonn, Germany.     

11.   
 
  Relates to guaranteed minimum payments owed in connection with our settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit brought against the Company by DataSci, LLC.     

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  
     
   Debt Obligations   
     
  We are currently in arrears on principal and interest payments owed totaling $205,379 on our 10% Convertible Notes that were issued in 1999. We were in default effective January 30, 2002.  
     
  On January 1, 2014, the Company issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $980,000 and warrants to purchase 3,920,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.25 with an expiration date of April 1, 2017 to our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Cornelis F. Wit ( Mr. Wit ), in exchange for accrued interest in the amount of $980,000. The note carries an interest rate of 12% per annum and is due on April 1, 2017. On October 15, 2015 the Company issued a promissory note in the amount of $980,000 to Mr. Wit in exchange for the existing promissory note in the same amount. The promissory note carries an interest rate of 12% and has a maturity date of January 1, 2019. The expiration date of the warrants associated with the promissory note was also extended to January 1, 2019. On November 19, 2015 the promissory note and the related warrants were cancelled in exchange for 3,920,000 shares of our common stock.  
     
  On April 4, 2014 the Company issued a promissory note payable to Mr. Wit in the amount of $1,600,000 in exchange for an existing promissory note in the same amount. The promissory note carries an interest rate of 12% and has a maturity date of April 1, 2017. On October 15, 2015 the Company issued a promissory note in the amount of $1,600,000 to Mr. Wit in exchange for the existing promissory note in the same amount. The promissory note carries an interest rate of 12% and has a maturity date of January 1, 2019. The expiration date of the warrants associated with the promissory note was also extended to January 1, 2019. On November 19, 2015 the promissory note, 400,000 related warrants and 6,000,000 unrelated warrants were cancelled in exchange for 6,400,000 shares of our common stock. On November 23, 2015 Mr. Wit sold 4,000,000 of the related warrants to three employees of the Company. On December 17, 2015 Mr. Wit sold 2,000,000 of the related warrants to a fourth employee of the Company.

On April 21, 2014, the Company and our former director, Mr. van Kesteren ( Mr. van Kesteren) extended the maturity date of his $150,000 of convertible debentures to April 1, 2016. The expiration date of the warrants associated with the debentures was also extended to April 1, 2016. On July 31, 2014 Mr. van Kesteren s term on the Board of Directors ended.

   Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Because of the losses we have experienced from operations we have needed to continue utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of debt and the sale of equity securities to fund our working capital needs. We have used a combination of equity financing, short-term bridge loans and long-term loans to fund our working capital needs. Other than our revenues, current capital and capital we may raise from future debt or equity offerings, the $5,000,000 revolving line of credit with The Northern Trust Company ($4  ,100,000 of which is outstanding as of September 30, 2016) or short-term bridge loans, we do not have any additional sources of working capital.     
     
  We may continue to require substantial funds to continue our research and product development activities and to market, sell and commercialize our technology. We may need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our future operations. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the problems, delays, expenses and complications frequently encountered by companies developing and commercializing new technologies; the progress of our research and product development activities; the rate of technological advances; determinations as to the commercial potential of our technology under development; the status of competitive technology; the establishment of collaborative relationships; the success of our sales and marketing programs; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; and other changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions in our planned business.  Estimates about the adequacy of funding for our activities are based upon certain assumptions, including assumptions that our research and product development programs relating to our technology can be conducted at projected costs and that progress towards broader commercialization of our technology will be timely and successful. There can be no assurance that changes in our research and product development plans or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures.  
     
  While we have not sought capital from venture capital or private equity sources we believe that those sources of capital remain available although possibly under terms and conditions that might be disadvantageous to existing investors.  
     
  To satisfy our capital requirements, including ongoing future operations, we may seek to raise additional financing through debt and equity financings. There can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs, and our business operations. If we are successful in obtaining additional financings, the terms of such financings may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of our stockholders or impose restrictive covenants that may adversely impact our business. Further, there can be no assurance that even if such additional capital is obtained or planned cost reductions are implemented, that we will achieve positive cash flow or profitability or be able to continue as a business.  
     
  While several of our officers and directors have historically, either personally or through funds with which they are affiliated, provided substantial capital either in the form of debt or equity financing there can be no assurance that they will continue to provide any such funding to us on favorable terms or at all.  
     
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below.  
     
  A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: 1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and 2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  
     
  Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, our Management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time.  Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, our Management believes that our condensed consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.  

53

Our Management believes that the following are our critical accounting policies:  
     
   ASSET IMPAIRMENT   
     
    Asset Acquisitions and Intangible Assets    
     
  We account for asset acquisitions in accordance with ASC 350,  Intangibles-  Goodwill and Other . The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of an asset acquisition.  
     
  The judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following an asset acquisition. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.  
     
    Long Lived Assets    
     
  We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset s residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. We use quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value.  
     
   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT   
     
  OmniComm s capital structure includes the use of warrants and convertible debt features that are classified as derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value under ASC 815  ,  Derivatives and Hedging.  ASC 815 requires that changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments with no hedging designation be recognized as gains/(losses) in the earnings statement. The fair value measurement is determined in accordance with ASC 820  ,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.   
     
   DEFERRED REVENUE   
     
  Deferred revenue represents cash advances and accounts receivable in excess of revenue earned on on-going contracts.  Payment terms vary with each contract but may include an initial payment at the time the contract is executed, with future payments dependent upon the completion of certain contract phases or targeted milestones.  In the event of contract cancellation, the Company is generally entitled to payment for all work performed through the point of cancellation.  
     
   REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY   
     
  OmniComm s revenue model is transaction-based and can be implemented either as an ASP (application service provider) or licensed for implementation by a customer such as a pharmaceutical company.  Revenues are derived from the set-up of clinical trial engagements; licensing arrangements, fees earned for hosting our clients  data and projects, on-going maintenance fees incurred throughout the duration of an engagement; and fees for report writing and project change orders.  The clinical trials that are conducted using our EDC applications can last from a few months to several years.  Most of the fees associated with our product including post-setup customer support in the form of maintenance charges are recognized ratably over the term of clinical trial projects.  Cost of sales is primarily comprised of programmer salaries and taxes and is expensed as incurred.  

54

The Company recognizes revenues, for both financial statement and tax purposes in accordance with  SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 104)   (Codified within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Revenue Recognition ASC 605) and AICPA Statement of  Position 97-2 (SOP 97-2)  Software Revenue Recognition  as amended by SOP 98-9 (Codified within ASC 605.985, Software Industry Revenue Recognition).  SAB 104 requires that revenues be recognized ratably over the life of a contract.  The Company will periodically record deferred revenues relating to advance payments in contracts.  Under its licensing arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to SOP 97-2.  Under these arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer and/or delivery has occurred; (3) the collection of fees is probable; and (4) the fee is fixed or determinable.  SOP 97-2, as amended, requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements.  We have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) to allocate revenues to license updates and product support.  License revenues are recognized on delivery if the other conditions of SOP 97-2 are satisfied.  License updates and product support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. In arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, we allocate the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the VSOE of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual licenses of similar products.  
     
   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.   
     
  The Company accounts for its employee equity incentive plans under   ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ) which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.  
     
  ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company currently uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine grant date fair value.  
     
    EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED     ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    
     
  During the first nine months of 2016, we adopted the following new accounting pronouncements:  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting standard update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , ( ASU 2016-02 ). This ASU requires that an entity should recognize assets and liabilities for leases with a maximum possible term of more than 12 months. A lessee would recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the leased asset (the underlying asset) for the lease term. This guidance also provides accounting updates with respect to lessor accounting under a lease arrangement. This new lease guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified approach (cumulative effect adjustment in period of adoption) to adopt the new guidance. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance in our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) , ( ASU 2016-09 ). This guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the full impact of the new standard.  
     
  Accounting standards-setting organizations frequently issue new or revised accounting rules. We regularly review all new pronouncements that have been issued since the filing of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 to determine their impact, if any, on our financial statements.  
     
    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
  Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.  

55

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, being September 30, 2016, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in  Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) are effective such that the information relating to OmniComm, including our consolidating subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
  It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.  
     
    PART II      . OTHER INFORMATION
