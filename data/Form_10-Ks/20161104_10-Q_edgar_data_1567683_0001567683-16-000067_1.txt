    The Company's ability to operate its businesses efficiently, manage maintenance capital expenditures and costs effectively, and generate earnings and cash flows from its asset-based businesses in relation to its debt and other obligations; 
                
    The willingness and ability of counterparties to the Company's offtake agreements to fulfill their obligations under such agreements; 
                
    The Company's ability to enter into contracts to sell power and procure fuel on acceptable terms and prices as current offtake agreements expire; 
                
    Government regulation, including compliance with regulatory requirements and changes in market rules, rates, tariffs and environmental laws; 
                
    Changes in law, including judicial decisions; 
                
    Operating and financial restrictions placed on the Company that are contained in the project-level debt facilities and other agreements of certain subsidiaries and project-level subsidiaries generally, in the NRG Yield Operating LLC amended and restated revolving credit facility, in the indentures governing the Senior Notes and in the indentures governing the Company's convertible notes; and

NRG YIELD, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1       Nature of Business 
  NRG Yield, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a dividend growth-oriented company formed by NRG as a Delaware corporation on December 20, 2012, to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets.  NRG Yield, Inc. owns   100%   of the Class A units and Class C units of NRG Yield LLC, including a controlling interest through its position as managing member.  NRG Yield LLC, through its wholly owned subsidiary, NRG Yield Operating LLC, is the holder of a portfolio of renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets, primarily located in the Northeast, Southwest and California regions of the U.S.  
  NRG Yield, Inc. consolidates the results of NRG Yield LLC through its controlling interest, with NRG's interest shown as noncontrolling interest in the financial statements.  On May 14, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc. completed a stock split whereby each outstanding share of Class A common stock was split into one share of Class A common stock and one share of Class C common stock, and each outstanding share of Class B common stock was split into one share of Class B common stock and one share of Class D common stock.  The stock split is referred to as the Recapitalization and all references to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Recapitalization.  In addition, on June 29, 2015, NRG Yield, Inc. completed the issuance of   28,198,000   shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of   $599 million  . The holders of NRG Yield, Inc.'s outstanding shares of Class A and Class C common stock are entitled to dividends as declared.  NRG receives its distributions from NRG Yield LLC through its ownership of NRG Yield LLC Class B and Class D units. 
  The following table represents the structure of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  : 

11 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's operating assets are comprised of the following projects: 

12 

(a)     Net capacity represents the maximum, or rated, generating capacity of the facility multiplied by the Company's percentage ownership in the facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
   (b)     Projects are part of tax equity arrangements. 
   (c)     For thermal energy, net capacity represents MWt for steam or chilled water and excludes   134   MWt available under the right-to-use provisions contained in agreements between two of the Company's thermal facilities and certain of its customers. 
   (d)     Total net capacity excludes   43   MW for RPV Holdco and   52   MW for DGPV Holdco 1 and DGPV Holdco 2 projects, of which the Company's net interests are   41   MW and   49  , respectively, based on cash to be distributed.  These projects are part of tax equity arrangements and are consolidated by NRG, as further described in   Note 4  ,   Variable Interest Entities, or VIEs  . 
  Substantially all of the Company's generation assets are under long-term contractual arrangements for the output or capacity from these assets.  The thermal assets are comprised of district energy systems and combined heat and power plants that produce steam, hot water and/or chilled water and in some instances, electricity, at a central plant.  Three out of the fourteen district energy systems are subject to rate regulation by state public utility commissions while the other district energy systems have rates determined by negotiated bilateral contracts. 
  As described in   Note 11  ,   Related Party Transactions  , the Company has a management services agreement with NRG for various services, including human resources, accounting, tax, legal, information systems, treasury, and risk management.  
  Stockholders' equity represents the equity associated with the Class A and Class C common stockholders, the equity associated with the Class B and Class D common stockholder, NRG, and the third-party interests under certain tax equity arrangements classified as noncontrolling interest.  
  As described in   Note 3  ,   Business Acquisitions  , on September 1, 2016, the Company acquired the remaining   51.05%   of CVSR, or the CVSR Drop Down, from NRG for cash consideration of   $78.5 million   plus an immaterial working capital adjustment.  Prior to the transaction, the Company recorded its   48.95%   interest in CVSR as an equity method investment.  The acquisition of the CVSR Drop Down was accounted for as a transfer of entities under common control.  The accounting guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect from the beginning of the financial statement period or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statement period).  Accordingly, in connection with the retrospective adjustment of prior periods, the Company removed the equity method investment from all prior periods and adjusted its financial statements to reflect its results of operations, financial position and cash flows as if it had consolidated CVSR from the beginning of the financial statement period.  
  Previously, on November 3, 2015, the Company acquired   75%   of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco, or the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, from NRG for cash consideration of   $209 million  .  In February 2016, NRG made a final working capital payment of   $2 million  , reducing total cash consideration to   $207 million  .  The Company has recorded all minority interests in NRG Wind TE Holdco as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired the Laredo Ridge, Tapestry, and Walnut Creek projects, or the January 2015 Drop Down Assets, for total cash consideration of   $489 million  , including   $9 million   for working capital.   
  The recast for the above transactions, referred to as Drop Down Assets, did not affect net income attributable to NRG Yield, Inc., weighted average number of shares outstanding, earnings per share or dividends.   
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the SEC s regulations for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  The following notes should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies and other disclosures as set forth in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company's September 6, 2016 Form 8-K.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.  
  
    13 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments consisting of normal and recurring accruals necessary to present fairly the Company's consolidated financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could be different from these estimates. 
  Accumulated Depreciation, Accumulated Amortization 
  The following table presents the accumulated depreciation included in the property, plant and equipment, net, and accumulated amortization included in intangible assets, net, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Noncontrolling Interests  
  The following table reflects the changes in the Company's noncontrolling interest balance: 

Distributions to NRG for Drop Down Assets 
  Distributions to NRG for Drop Down Assets relate to NRG's 25% interest in the November 2015 Drop Down Assets as well as NRG's 51.05% interest in CVSR prior to its acquisition by the Company.  This amount includes cash and non-cash distributions and includes portion of the proceeds from the senior notes issued under the CVSR Holdco Financing Arrangement on July 15, 2016, as described in Note 7,   Long-term Debt  .  
  
    14 

Yield LLC Distributions to NRG 
  The following table lists the distributions paid on NRG Yield LLC's Class B and D units during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

On   November 2, 2016  , NRG Yield LLC declared a distribution on its units of   $0.25   per unit payable on   December 15, 2016   to unit holders of record as of   December 1, 2016  .   
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. 
  Recent Accounting Developments 
  ASU 2016-16   - In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)  , Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, or ASU No. 2016-16.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 were issued to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party which has resulted in diversity in practice and increased complexity within financial reporting.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 would require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and do not require new disclosure requirements.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  ASU 2016-15     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  , Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, or ASU No. 2016-15.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 were issued to address eight specific cash flow issues for which stakeholders have indicated to the FASB that a diversity in practice existed in how entities were presenting and classifying these items in the statement of cash flows.  The issues addressed by ASU No. 2016-15 include but are not limited to the classification of debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, payments made for contingent consideration for a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance proceeds, distributions received from equity method investees and separately identifiable cash flows and the application of the predominance principle.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods in those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim fiscal period with all amendments adopted in the same period.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 is required to be applied retrospectively.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company's statement of cash flows. 
  ASU 2016-07     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures   (Topic 323), or ASU No. 2016-07.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-07 eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held.  The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting with no retroactive adjustment to the investment.  In addition, ASU No. 2016-07 requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-07 is required to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  
    15 

ASU 2016-02     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842), or ASU No. 2016-02.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-02 complete the joint effort between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, to develop a common leasing standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, with the objective to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to improve financial reporting.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 provides that a lessee that may have previously accounted for a lease as an operating lease under current GAAP should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from a lease on the balance sheet.  In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures with regards to lease arrangements.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach for the earliest period presented and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently working through an adoption plan which includes the evaluation of lease contracts compared to the new standard and evaluating the impact of ASU No.2016-02 on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  ASU 2016-01     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , or ASU No. 2016-01.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-01 eliminate available-for-sale classification of equity investments and require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be generally measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Further, the amendments require financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  ASU 2015-16     In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , or ASU No. 2015-16.  The amendments of ASU No. 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize measurement period adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized in a business combination in the reporting period during which the adjustments are determined.  Additionally, the amendments of ASU No. 2015-16 require the acquirer to record in the same period's financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the measurement period adjustment, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the  acquisition date as well as disclosing on either the face of the income statement or in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods.  The guidance in ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The amendments should be applied prospectively.  The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this standard did not impact the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.    
  ASU 2014-09     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606), or ASU No. 2014-09.  The amendments of ASU No. 2014-09 complete the joint effort between the FASB and the IASB, to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS, and to improve financial reporting.   In addition to ASU No. 2014-09, the FASB has issued additional guidance which provides further clarification on Topic 606 including ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12.  The guidance under Topic 606 provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services provided and establishes a four step process to be applied by an entity in evaluating its contracts with customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which formally deferred the effective date by one year to make the guidance of ASU No. 2014-09 effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted, but not prior to the original effective date, which was for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is working through an adoption plan which includes the evaluation of revenue contracts compared to the new standard and evaluating the impact of Topic 606 on the Company' results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  

Note 3       Business Acquisitions 
  2016 Acquisitions 
  CVSR Drop Down      Prior to September 1, 2016, the Company had a   48.95%   interest in CVSR, which was accounted for as an equity method investment.      On September 1, 2016, the Company acquired from NRG the remaining   51.05%   interest of CVSR Holdco LLC, which indirectly owns the CVSR solar facility, for total cash consideration of   $78.5 million   plus an immaterial working capital adjustment.  The Company also assumed additional debt of   $496 million  , which represents 51.05% of the CVSR project level debt and 51.05% of the notes issued under the CVSR Holdco Financing Agreement, as further described in Note 7,   Long-term Debt  , as of the closing date.  The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. 
  
    16 

The assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and were recorded at historical cost in accordance with ASC 805-50,   Business Combinations - Related Issues  .  The difference between the cash paid and historical value of the entities' equity was recorded as a distribution to NRG with the offset to noncontrolling interest.  Because the transaction constituted a transfer of net assets under common control, the guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control.  In connection with the retrospective adjustment of prior periods, the Company has removed the equity method investment from all prior periods and adjusted its financial statements to reflect its results of operations, financial position and cash flows as if it had consolidated CVSR from the beginning of the financial statement period.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company's recast consolidated balance sheet included a net receivable of $  67 million   related to current litigation with SunPower pursuant to indemnities in the project.  The agreement between NRG and the Company for the CVSR Drop Down acquisition specified that all amounts related to the litigation with SunPower were excluded from the acquisition.  Accordingly, prior to close of the transaction, the net receivable was transferred to NRG as a net reduction to its ownership interest in CVSR.   
  The following is the summary of historical net liabilities assumed in connection with the CVSR Drop Down as of September 1, 2016:

  2015 Acquisitions 
  November 2015 Drop Down Assets from NRG       On November 3, 2015, the Company acquired the November 2015 Drop Down Assets, a portfolio of   12   wind facilities totaling   814   net MW, from NRG for cash consideration of   $209 million  , subject to working capital adjustments.  In February 2016, NRG made a final working capital payment of   $2 million  , reducing total cash consideration to   $207 million  .  The Company is responsible for its pro-rata share of non-recourse project debt of   $193 million   and noncontrolling interest associated with a tax equity structure of   $159 million   (as of the acquisition date). 
  The Company funded the acquisition with borrowings from its revolving credit facility.  The assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and were recorded at historical cost.  The difference between the cash paid and historical value of the entities' equity was recorded as a distribution from NRG with the offset to noncontrolling interest.  
  The Class A interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco are owned by a tax equity investor, or TE Investor, who receives   99%   of allocations of taxable income and other items until the flip point, which occurs when the TE Investor obtains a specified return on its initial investment, at which time the allocations to the TE Investor change to   8.53%  .  The Company generally receives   75%   of CAFD until the flip point, at which time the allocations to the Company of CAFD change to   68.60%  .  If the flip point has not occurred by a specified date,   100%   of CAFD is allocated to the TE Investor until the flip point occurs.  NRG Wind TE Holdco is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary, through its position as managing member, and consolidates NRG Wind TE Holdco. 
  
    17 

Desert Sunlight       On June 29, 2015, the Company acquired   25%   of the membership interest in Desert Sunlight Investment Holdings, LLC, which owns   two   solar photovoltaic facilities that total   550   MW, located in Desert Center, California from EFS Desert Sun, LLC, an affiliate of GE Energy Financial Services for a purchase price of   $285 million  .  Power generated by the facilities is sold to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric under long-term PPAs with approximately   20 years   and   25 years   of remaining contract life, respectively.  The Company accounts for its   25%   investment as an equity method investment. 
  Spring Canyon       On May 7, 2015, the Company acquired a   90.1%   interest in Spring Canyon II, a   32   MW wind facility, and Spring Canyon III, a   28   MW wind facility, each located in Logan County, Colorado, from Invenergy Wind Global LLC.  The purchase price was funded with cash on hand.  Power generated by Spring Canyon II and Spring Canyon III is sold to Platte River Power Authority under long-term PPAs with approximately   24 years   of remaining contract life. 
  University of Bridgeport Fuel Cell         On April 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the University of Bridgeport Fuel Cell project in Bridgeport, Connecticut from FuelCell Energy, Inc.  The project added an additional   1.4   MW of thermal capacity to the Company's portfolio, with a   12  -year contract, with the option for a   7  -year extension.  The acquisition is reflected in the Company's Thermal segment. 
  January 2015 Drop Down Assets from NRG       On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired the following projects from NRG: (i) Laredo Ridge, an   80   MW wind facility located in Petersburg, Nebraska, (ii) Tapestry, which includes Buffalo Bear, a   19   MW wind facility in Buffalo, Oklahoma; Taloga, a   130   MW wind facility in Putnam, Oklahoma; and Pinnacle, a   55   MW wind facility in Keyser, West Virginia, and (iii)  Walnut Creek, a   485   MW natural gas facility located in City of Industry, California, for total cash consideration of   $489 million  , including   $9 million   for working capital, plus assumed project-level debt of   $737 million  .  The Company funded the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under its revolving credit facility.  The assets and liabilities transferred to the Company relate to interests under common control by NRG and were recorded at historical cost.  The difference between the cash paid and the historical value of the entities' equity of   $61 million  , as well as   $23 million   of AOCL, was recorded as a distribution to NRG and reduced the balance of its noncontrolling interest.  

Note 4       Variable Interest Entities, or VIEs    
  Entities that are Consolidated 
  The Company has a controlling financial interest in certain entities which have been identified as VIEs under ASC 810,   Consolidations,   or ASC 810.  These arrangements are primarily related to tax equity arrangements entered into with third parties in order to monetize certain tax credits associated with wind facilities, as further described in   Note 5  ,     Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities  ,   to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's September 6, 2016 Form 8-K. 
  Summarized financial information for the Company's consolidated VIEs consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016  : 

18 

Entities that are not Consolidated 
  The Company has interests in entities that are considered VIEs under ASC 810, but for which it is not considered the primary beneficiary.  The Company accounts for its interests in these entities under the equity method of accounting, as further described in   Note 5  ,     Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities  ,   to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's September 6, 2016 Form 8-K. 
  NRG DGPV Holdco 1 LLC       The Company and NRG maintain a partnership, NRG DGPV Holdco 1 LLC, or DGPV Holdco 1, the purpose of which is to own or purchase solar power generation projects and other ancillary related assets from  NRG Renew LLC or its subsidiaries via intermediate funds, including: (i) a tax equity-financed portfolio of   10   recently completed community solar projects representing approximately   8   MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of   20 years  ; and (ii) a tax equity-financed portfolio of approximately   12   commercial photovoltaic systems representing approximately   37   MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of   19 years  .  Both of these investments relate to the Company's   $100 million   commitment to distributed solar projects in partnership with NRG. 
  NRG DGPV Holdco 2 LLC       On February 29, 2016,     the Company and NRG entered into an additional partnership by forming NRG DGPV Holdco 2 LLC, or DGPV Holdco 2, to own or purchase solar power generation projects representing approximately   7   MW with a weighted average remaining PPA term of   18   years as well as other ancillary related assets from NRG Renew LLC or its subsidiaries, via intermediate funds.  Under this partnership, the Company committed to fund up to   $50 million   of capital.   
  The Company's maximum exposure to loss is limited to its equity investment in DGPV Holdco 1 and DGPV Holdco 2, which was   $77 million   on a combined basis as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  NRG RPV Holdco 1 LLC       The Company and NRG Residential Solar Solutions LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, maintain a partnership, NRG RPV Holdco 1 LLC, or RPV Holdco, that holds operating portfolios of residential solar assets developed by NRG's residential solar business, including: (i) an existing, unlevered portfolio of over   2,000   leases across nine states representing approximately   15   MW with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately   17 years   that was acquired outside of the partnership; and (ii) a tax equity-financed portfolio of approximately   5,400   leases representing approximately   28   MW, with an average lease term for the existing and new leases of approximately   17   to   20 years  .  In addition to the acquisition of the unlevered portfolio of leases, the Company had previously committed to fund up to   $150 million   of capital to invest in the tax equity financed portfolio, which was reduced to   $100 million   in February 2016.  On August 5, 2016, the Company and NRG amended the RPV Holdco partnership to further reduce that capital commitment of   $100 million   to   $60 million   in connection with NRG s change in business model approach in the residential solar business.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had contributed   $57 million   of this amount.

Note 5       Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  Fair Value Accounting under ASC 820 
  ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows: 
             
    Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. 
                
    Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
     In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  For cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts receivable   affiliate, accounts payable, accounts payable   affiliate, accrued expenses and other liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  
  The estimated carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s recorded financial instruments not carried at fair market value are as follows: 

20 

The fair value of the Company's publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of debt securities, non-publicly traded long-term debt and certain notes receivable of the Company are based on expected future cash flows discounted at market interest rates, or current interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit quality and are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  The following table presents the level within the fair value hierarchy for long-term debt, including current portion as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company records its derivative assets and liabilities at fair value on its consolidated balance sheet.  There were no derivative asset positions on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  .  The following table presents assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy: 

(a)     There were   no   derivative assets or liabilities classified as Level 1 or Level 3 as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Derivative Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company's contracts are non-exchange-traded and valued using prices provided by external sources.  For the Company s energy markets, management receives quotes from multiple sources.  To the extent that multiple quotes are received, the prices reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained from all sources believed to provide the most liquid market for the commodity. 
  The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, a credit reserve is applied to reflect credit risk, which is, for interest rate swaps, calculated based on credit default swaps using the bilateral method.  For commodities, to the extent that the net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty s default swap rate.  If the net exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses NRG's default swap rate.  For interest rate swaps and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume the liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for the assets.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the credit reserve resulted in a   $4 million   increase in fair value, which was composed of a   $3 million   gain in OCI and   $1 million   reduction in interest expense.  It is possible that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities and such variations could be material.

Concentration of Credit Risk 
  In addition to the credit risk discussion in   Note 2  ,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ,   to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's   September 6, 2016 Form 8-K, the following is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments.  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) daily monitoring of counterparties' credit limits; (iii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty.  Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows.  The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. 
  Counterparty credit exposure includes credit risk exposure under certain long-term agreements, including solar and other PPAs.  As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company estimates the exposure related to these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics.  Based on these valuation techniques, as of   September 30, 2016  , credit risk exposure to these counterparties attributable to the Company's ownership interests was approximately   $2.6 billion   for the next   five years  .  The majority of these power contracts are with utilities with strong credit quality and public utility commission or other regulatory support, as further described in   Note 12  ,   Segment Reporting  ,   to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the   Company's September 6, 2016 Form 8-K  .    However, such regulated utility counterparties can be impacted by changes in government regulations, which the Company is unable to predict.

The Company has elected to present derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheet on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no offsetting amounts at the counterparty master agreement level or outstanding collateral paid or received.                  

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The following table summarizes the effects on the Company s accumulated OCL balance attributable to interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedge derivatives, net of tax: 

(a)     Retrospectively adjusted as discussed in Note 1,   Nature of Business  . 
  Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCL into income and amounts recognized in income from the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recorded to interest expense.  There was   no   ineffectiveness for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Impact of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Income 
  The Company has interest rate derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges.  The effect of interest rate hedges is recorded to interest expense.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the impact to the consolidated statements of income was a   gain   of   $2 million   and a   loss   of   $6 million  , respectively.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the impact to the consolidated statements of income was a   loss   of   $7 million   and a   gain   of   $13 million  , respectively. 
  
    23 

A portion of the Company s derivative commodity contracts relates to its Thermal Business for the purchase of fuel commodities based on the forecasted usage of the thermal district energy centers.  Realized gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the fuel costs that are permitted to be billed to customers through the related customer contracts or tariffs and, accordingly, no gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for these contracts.   
  In 2015, certain NRG subsidiaries entered into commodity contracts with NRG Power Marketing and NRG Texas Power LLC.  The purpose of these commodity contracts was to hedge the forecasted sale of power for Elbow Creek, Goat Wind, Alta X and Alta XI until the start of the PPAs.  The effect of these commodity hedges was recorded to operating revenues, as described in Note 11,   Related Party Transactions  .  For the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the impact to the consolidated statements of income was an unrealized   loss   of   $2 million   and an unrealized   gain   of   $1 million  , respectively.

Note 8       Earnings Per Share    
  Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Shares issued during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period. 
  The reconciliation of the Company's basic and diluted earnings per share is shown in the following tables:  

(a)     Net income attributable to NRG Yield, Inc. and basic and diluted earnings per share might not recalculate due to presenting values in millions rather than whole dollars.  
  With respect to the Class A common stock, there were a total of   15 million   anti-dilutive outstanding equity instruments for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , related to the 2019 Convertible Notes.

Note 10       Income Taxes    
  Effective Tax Rate 
  The income tax provision consisted of the following:  

For the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from its interest in NRG Yield LLC and production and investment tax credits generated from certain wind and solar assets, respectively. 
  For tax purposes, NRG Yield LLC is treated as a partnership; therefore, the Company and NRG each record their respective share of taxable income or loss.

Note 12         Contingencies     
  The Company's material legal proceedings are described below.  The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously.  The Company records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated.  In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred.  Management assesses such matters based on current information and makes a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the legal proceedings below or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities.  As additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly.  Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded reserves and that such difference could be material. 
  In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, the Company and its subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  Braun v. NRG Yield, Inc.     On April 19, 2016, plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit against NRG Yield, Inc., the current and former members of its board of directors individually, and other parties in California Superior Court in Kern County, CA.  Plaintiffs allege various violations of the Securities Act due to the defendants  alleged failure to disclose material facts related to low wind production prior to NRG Yield, Inc.'s June 22, 2015 Class C common stock offering.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, rescission, attorney s fees and costs.  On August 3, 2016, the court approved a stipulation entered into by the parties.  The stipulation provided that the plaintiffs would file an amended complaint by August 19, 2016, which they did on August 18, 2016.  The defendants filed demurrers and a motion challenging jurisdiction on October 18, 2016. 
  Ahmed v. NRG Energy, Inc. and the NRG Yield Board of Directors     On September 15, 2016, plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit against NRG Energy, Inc., the directors of NRG Yield, Inc., and other parties in the Delaware Chancery Court.  The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their respective fiduciary duties with regard to the recapitalization of NRG Yield, Inc. common stock in 2015.  The plaintiffs generally seek economic damages, attorney s fees and injunctive relief.  The defendants filed responsive pleadings on November 4, 2016.

Executive Summary 
  Introduction and Overview  
  The Company is a dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG owns, operates and acquires contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets.  The Company believes it is well positioned to be a premier company for investors seeking stable and growing dividend income from a diversified portfolio of lower-risk high-quality assets.   
  The Company owns a diversified portfolio of contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets in the U.S.  The Company s contracted generation portfolio collectively represents     4,563   net MW as of September 30, 2016.    Each of these assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately     17 years   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   based on CAFD  .  The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of   1,315   net MWt and electric generation capacity of   123   net MW.  These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions. 
  Regulatory Matters  
  The Company s regulatory matters are described in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K in Item 1,   Business       Regulatory Matters   and Item 1A,   Risk Factors.    
  As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and thermal energy markets, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies.  These include FERC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Company's assets are located.  Each of the Company's U.S. generating facilities qualifies as a EWG or QF.  In addition, the Company is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates.  Likewise, the Company must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company operates.     
  The Company's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce.  These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT. 
  Environmental Matters  
  The Company s environmental matters are described in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K in Item 1,   Business       Environmental Matters   and Item 1A,   Risk Factors.    
  The Company is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects.  These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of facilities.  The Company is also subject to laws and regulations surrounding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species.  Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent and the Company expects this trend to continue. 
  Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Future Business Performance 
  Wind and Solar Resource Availability 
  The availability of the wind and solar resources affects the financial performance of the wind and solar facilities, which may impact the Company s overall financial performance.  Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company cannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter.  To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company s financial performance for such periods.  
  Capital     Market Conditions 
  The capital markets in general are often subject to volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The Company s growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional conventional and renewable facilities from NRG and unaffiliated third parties, which will require access to debt and equity financing to complete such acquisitions or replenish capital for future acquisitions.  Any broad market fluctuations may affect the Company s ability to access such capital through debt or equity financings. 
  
    35 

Operational Matters 
  Walnut Creek Forced Outage 
  In July and August 2016, Walnut Creek experienced two unrelated outages causing damage to a circuit breaker and a compressor resulting in forced outages on Units 2 and 4, respectively.  The Company has undertaken a root cause analysis and is reviewing what is covered by warranty or available insurance coverage.  Unit 2 returned to service on August 10, 2016 and Unit 4 returned to service on September 15, 2016.

Consolidated Results of Operations  
  The following table provides selected financial information: 

(a)     Volumes sold do not include the MWh generated by the Company's equity method investments. 
   (b)     Volumes generated are not sold as the Conventional facilities sell capacity rather than energy.  
   (c)     MWh sold do not include 110 MWh and 184 MWh generated by NRG Dover, a subsidiary of the Company, under the PPA with NRG Power Marketing during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as further described in Note 11,   Related Party Transactions  .

Management s Discussion of the Results of Operations for the Three Months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015 
  Gross Margin and Economic Gross Margin 
  In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.  Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company' presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker.  Economic gross margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue less cost of fuels.  Economic gross margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market gains, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities.  Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.  
    
  The below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to economic gross margin, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  : 

38 

Gross margin   increased   by   $18 million   and economic gross margin   increased   by   $19 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to:     
                       
    (In millions) 
      
      Increase in Renewables economic gross margin due to a 20% increase in volume generated at Alta wind projects, as well as 5% increase in solar generation, primarily at CVSR 
    $ 
    14 
      
      Increase in Renewables economic gross margin due to an increase in price per MWh at Alta X and XI wind projects as the PPAs began in January 2016, compared to merchant prices in 2015 
    7 
      
      Increase in Thermal economic gross margin primarily due to increased consumption revenue at several Thermal entities 
    2 
      
      Decrease in Conventional economic gross margin primarily to due forced outages at Walnut Creek in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by increased capacity revenue at Marsh Landing due to a favorable performance test

Operations and Maintenance Expense  
  Operations and maintenance expense   decreased   by   $3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily   due to fewer third party service contracts, partially offset by the forced outages at Walnut Creek in the third quarter of 2016.                      

Interest Expense      
  Interest expense remained flat during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to: 
                       
    (In millions) 
      
      Increase due to higher revolving credit facility borrowings in 2016

For the same period in   2015  , the Company recorded income tax   expense   of   $8 million   on pretax   income   of   $40 million  .  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from NRG's interest in NRG Yield LLC and production and investment tax credits generated from certain wind and solar assets, respectively.  
  Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   income   of   $46 million   attributable to NRG's interest in the Company and   a loss   of   $38 million   attributable to non-controlling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   income   of   $22 million   attributable to NRG's interest in the Company and   a loss   of   $5 million   attributable to non-controlling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method.

Gross margin   increased   by   $64 million   and economic gross margin   increased   by   $82 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due to: 
                       
    (In millions) 
      
      Increase in Renewables economic gross margin due to a 31% increase in volume generated at the Alta wind projects, as well as a 3% increase in solar generation, primarily CVSR.  Additionally, there was an increase in economic gross margin of $3 million at Spring Canyon which was acquired in May 2015 
    $ 
    55 
      
      Increase in Renewables economic gross margin due to an increase in price per MWh at Alta X and XI wind projects as the PPAs began in January 2016, compared to merchant prices in 2015 
    23 
      
      Increase in Thermal economic gross margin primarily due to lower gas prices in addition to increased revenues in January 2016 compared to January 2015 due to higher volume  
    4 
      
      Conventional Generation economic gross margin remained flat primarily due to higher revenues at El Segundo as a result of forced outages in 2015, as well as increased capacity revenue at Marsh Landing due to a favorable performance test, offset by lower revenues at Walnut Creek as a result of forced outages in 2016

Other costs of operations   decreased   by   $3 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to   a property tax rebate received in 2016 for the Alta projects.                    

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates   increased   by   $10 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to   increased equity in earnings from Desert Sunlight, which was acquired in June 2015, DGPV Holdco 1, RPV Holdco and San Juan Mesa, partially offset by losses from Elkhorn Ridge.    
  Interest Expense        
  Interest expense   increased   by   $12 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due to:

For the same period in   2015  , the Company recorded income tax   expense   of   $8 million   on pretax   income   of   $61 million  .  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the overall effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to taxable earnings allocated to NRG resulting from NRG's interest in NRG Yield LLC and production and investment tax credits generated from certain wind and solar assets, respectively.  
  Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   income   of   $98 million   attributable to NRG related to its   46.7%   economic interest in NRG Yield LLC and its   25%   interest in NRG Wind TE Holdco.  Additionally, for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   a loss   of   $67 million   attributable to non-controlling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company had   income   of   $35 million   attributable to NRG's   55.3%   economic interest in the Company and   income   of   $2 million   attributable to non-controlling interests with respect to its tax equity financing arrangements and application of the HLBV method. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  The Company's principal liquidity requirements are to meet its financial commitments, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, to service debt and to pay dividends.  Historically, the Company's predecessor operations were financed as part of NRG's integrated operations and largely relied on internally generated cash flows as well as corporate and/or project-level borrowings to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements.    As a normal part of the Company's business, depending on market conditions, the Company will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance its indebtedness.  Changes in the Company's operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause the Company to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods.  There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.  Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions.  
  Liquidity Position 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's liquidity was approximately   $769 million   and   $375 million  , respectively, comprised of cash, restricted cash, and availability under the Company's revolving credit facility.  The Company's liquidity includes   $138 million   and   $131 million   of restricted cash balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Restricted cash consists primarily of funds to satisfy the requirements of certain debt agreements and funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use.  The Company's various financing arrangements are described in   Note 7  ,   Long-term Debt  .    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $431 million   of available borrowings under its revolving credit facility. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings and there were   $64 million   of letters of credit outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility. 
  Management believes that the Company's liquidity position, cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the Company's financial commitments; debt service obligations; growth, operating and maintenance capital expenditures; and to fund dividends to holders of the Company's Class A common stock and Class C common stock.  Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.

Credit Ratings 
  Credit rating agencies rate a firm's public debt securities.  These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firm's credit risk.  Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Company's ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends.  Rating agencies evaluate a firm's industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity, and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm's credit risk. 
  On August 15, 2016, S P lowered its corporate credit ratings on NRG Yield, Inc. and the 2024 Senior Notes to BB from BB+.  The ratings outlook is stable. 
  The following table summarizes the credit ratings for the Company and its Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Sources of Liquidity 
  The Company's principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from operations, borrowings under new and existing financing arrangements and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities as appropriate given market conditions.  As described in   Note 7  ,   Long-term Debt  , to this Form 10-Q and Note 9,   Long-term Debt  , to the consolidated annual financial statements included in the Company's   September 6, 2016 Form 8-K  , the Company's financing arrangements consist of the revolving credit facility, the 2019 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes, the Senior Notes, the ATM Program and project-level financings for its various assets. 
  NRG Yield Operating LLC 2026 Senior Notes 
  On August 18, 2016, NRG Yield Operating LLC issued   $350 million   of senior unsecured notes, or the 2026 Senior Notes.  The 2026 Senior Notes bear interest at   5.00%   and   mature on September 15, 2026.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, and interest payments will commence on March 15, 2017.  The 2026 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NRG Yield Operating LLC and are guaranteed by NRG Yield LLC, and by certain of NRG Yield Operating LLC s wholly owned current and future subsidiaries.  A portion of the proceeds of the 2026 Senior Notes were used to repay the Company's revolving credit facility. 
  At-the-Market Equity Offering Program 
  On August 9, 2016, NRG Yield, Inc. entered into an equity distribution agreement, or EDA, with Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as sales agents. Pursuant to the terms of the EDA, NRG Yield, Inc. may offer and sell shares of its Class C common stock par value $0.01 per share, from time to time through the sales agents, as NRG Yield, Inc. s sales agents for the offer and sale of the shares, up to an aggregate sales price of $150,000,000 through an at-the-market equity offering program, or ATM Program. NRG Yield, Inc. may also sell shares of its Class C common stock to any of the sales agents, as principals for its own account, at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. 
  As of October 31, 2016,   no shares   were issued under the ATM Program.

  On July 15, 2016, CVSR Holdco, the indirect owner of the CVSR solar facility, issued   $200 million   of senior secured notes that bear interest at   4.68%   and mature on March 31, 2037.  Net proceeds were distributed to the Company and NRG based on their respective ownership as of July 15, 2016, and accordingly, the Company received net proceeds of   $97.5 million  . The proceeds were utilized, along with   $28 million   of cash on hand, to reduce borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility.   
  Thermal Financing 
  On October 31, 2016, NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC, a subsidiary of NRG Thermal LLC, received proceeds of $125 million from the issuance of 3.55%   Series D notes due October 31, 2031, or the Series D Notes, and entered into a shelf facility for the anticipated issuance of an additional $70 million of notes.  The Series D Notes are, and the additional notes, if issued, will be secured by substantially all of the assets of NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC.  NRG Thermal LLC has  
  
    43 

guaranteed the indebtedness and its guarantee is secured by a pledge of the equity interests in all of NRG Thermal LLC s subsidiaries. NRG Energy Center Minneapolis LLC distributed the proceeds of the Series D Notes to NRG Thermal LLC, which in turn distributed the proceeds to NRG Yield Operating LLC to be utilized for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions.     

Uses of Liquidity 
  The Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, are categorized as: (i) debt service obligations, as described more fully in   Note 7  ,   Long-term Debt  ; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) acquisitions and investments; and (iv) cash dividends to investors. 
   
  Capital Expenditures 
  The Company's capital spending program is mainly focused on maintenance capital expenditures, or costs to maintain the assets currently operating, such as costs to replace or refurbish assets during routine maintenance, and growth capital expenditures or construction of new assets and completing the construction of assets where construction is in process.  The Company develops annual capital spending plans based on projected requirements for maintenance and growth capital.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company used approximately   $16 million   to fund capital expenditures, of which   $12 million   related to maintenance capital expenditures.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company used approximately   $17 million   to fund capital expenditures, of which   $8 million   related to maintenance capital expenditures. 
  Acquisitions and Investments 
  The Company intends to acquire generation and thermal infrastructure assets developed and constructed by NRG in the future, as well as generation and thermal infrastructure assets from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides a competitive advantage, and to utilize such acquisitions as a means to grow its CAFD.   
  CVSR         On September 1, 2016, the Company acquired the remaining   51.05%   interest of CVSR Holdco LLC, which indirectly owns the CVSR solar facility, from NRG for total cash consideration of   $78.5 million   plus an immaterial working capital adjustment.  The Company also assumed additional debt of $496 million, which represents 51.05% of the CVSR project level debt and 51.05% of the notes issued under the CVSR Holdco Financing Agreement.  The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.  
  UPMC   Thermal Project         On October 31, 2016, NRG Business Services LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, and NRG Energy Center Pittsburgh LLC, or NECP, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a EPC agreement for the construction of a 73 MWt district energy system for NECP to provide 150 kpph of steam, 6,750 tons of chilled water and 7.5 MW of emergency backup power service to UPMC. The initial term of the energy services agreement (under fixed capacity payments) with UPMC Mercy will be for a period of twenty years from the service commencement date.  Pursuant to the terms of the EPC agreement, NECP shall pay NRG Business Services LLC   $79 million  , subject to adjustment based upon certain conditions in the EPC agreement, upon substantial completion of the project. The project is expected to reach COD in the first quarter of 2018. 
   
  Cash Dividends to Investors 
  NRG Yield, Inc. intends to use the amount of cash that it receives from its distributions from NRG Yield LLC to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of its Class A common stock and Class C common stock.  NRG Yield LLC intends to distribute to its unit holders in the form of a quarterly distribution all of the CAFD it generates each quarter, less reserves for the prudent conduct of the business, including among others, maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the operating capacity of the assets.  CAFD is defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization; plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates; less cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, maintenance capital expenditures, pro-rata EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates, cash interest paid, income taxes paid, principal amortization of indebtedness and changes in other assets.  Dividends on t  he Class A common stock and Class C common stock are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations.  The Company expects that, based on current circumstances, comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the foreseeable future. 
  
    44 

The following table lists the dividends paid on NRG Yield, Inc.'s Class A common stock and Class C common stock during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

On   November 2, 2016  , NRG Yield, Inc. declared quarterly dividends on its Class A common stock and Class C common stock of   $0.25   per share payable on   December 15, 2016  , to stockholders of record as of   December 1, 2016  .

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740 
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company has a cumulative federal NOL carry forward balance of   $519 million   for financial statement purposes, which will begin expiring in 2033.  As a result of the Company's tax position, and based on current forecasts, the Company does not anticipate significant income tax payments for federal, state and local jurisdictions in   2016  .  Based on the Company's current and expected NOL balances generated primarily by accelerated tax depreciation of its property, plant and equipment, the Company does not expect to pay significant federal income tax for a period of approximately nine years. 
  The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company is not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations for years prior to 2013.   
  The Company has no uncertain tax benefits. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts 
  The Company may enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties.  
  Retained or Contingent Interests 
  The Company does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. 
  Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity 
  Variable interest in equity investments     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method. DGPV Holdco 1, DGPV Holdco 2, RPV Holdco and GenConn are variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. 
  The Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately   $450 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to the Company. See also   Note 4  ,   Variable Interest Entities, or VIEs  . 
  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
  The Company has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to our capital expenditure programs, as disclosed in the Company's September 6, 2016 Form 8-K. 
   
  Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
  The Company may enter into fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at certain generation facilities.  In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements. 
  The tables below disclose the activities of non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820.  Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at   September 30, 2016  , based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at   September 30, 2016  .  For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see   Derivative Fair Value Measurements   in   Note 5  ,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  . 

47 

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level.  As discussed below in   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk -Commodity Price Risk,   NRG, on behalf of the   Company, measures the sensitivity of the portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the net open position. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  The Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities.  These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use.  In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed. 
  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable.  In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates.  Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known. 
  The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  The Company's critical accounting policies include income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets and acquisition accounting.

ITEM 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  The Company is exposed to several market risks in its normal business activities.  Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company's power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction.  The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.    The following disclosures about market risk provide an update to, and should be read in conjunction with, Item 7A       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,   of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas and emissions credits.  The Company manages the commodity price risk of its merchant generation operations by entering into derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted power sales or purchases of fuel.  The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management's assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. 
  Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would cause a change of approximately   $1 million   to the net value of derivatives as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through its issuance of variable rate debt.  Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, or collars and put or call options.  These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument.  NRG's risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. 
  Most of the Company's project subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps, intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non-recourse project level debt.  See Note 9,   Long-Term Debt,   to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's   September 6, 2016 Form 8-K  , for more information about interest rate swaps of the Company's project subsidiaries. 
  If all of the interest rate swaps had been discontinued on   September 30, 2016  , the Company would have owed the counterparties   $142 million  .  Based on the credit ratings of the counterparties, the Company believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. 
  The Company has long-term debt instruments that subject it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , a 1% change in interest rates would result in an approximately   $3 million   change in market interest expense on a rolling twelve-month basis. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company's debt was   $5,729 million   and the carrying value was   $5,704 million  .  The Company estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of its long-term debt by approximately   $473 million  . 
  Liquidity Risk 
  Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and in the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. 
  Counterparty Credit Risk 
  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; and (ii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as prepayment arrangements or volumetric limits.  Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows.  The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties.

ITEM 4   Controls and Procedures 
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls     and     Procedures 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  Based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the   third   quarter of   2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

           3. 
    Conversion of RSU and Issuance of Shares 
     Upon vesting of the Award, one share of Class C Common Stock of the Company shall be issued for each RSU that vests on such vesting date, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan.   
           4. 
    Dividend Equivalent Rights 
     Cash dividends on Common Stock issuable hereunder shall be credited to a dividend book entry account on behalf of the Participant with respect to each RSU granted to the Participant, provided that such cash dividends shall be deemed to be reinvested in shares of Common Stock immediately following the time declared at the then fair market value of the Common Stock and shall vest and be paid at the same time that the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs vest and are delivered to the Participant in accordance with the provisions hereof.  Stock dividends on shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder shall be credited to a dividend book entry account on behalf of the Participant with respect to each RSU granted to the Participant, provided that such stock dividends shall vest and be paid at the same time that the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSU vest and are delivered to the Participant in accordance with the provisions hereof.

           9. 
    Committee Authority 
     Any question concerning the interpretation of this Agreement, any adjustments required to be made under the Plan, and any controversy that may arise under the Plan or the Grant Agreement shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

           11. 
    Limitation on Rights; No Right to Future Grants; Extraordinary Item 
     By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award, the Participant acknowledges that: (a) the Plan is discretionary and may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time as provided in the Plan, provided that, except as provided in Section 24 of the Plan, no amendment to this Agreement shall adversely affect in a material manner the Participant s rights under this Agreement without his or her written consent; (b) the grant of the Award is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of awards or benefits in lieu of awards; (c) all determinations with respect to any such future grants, including, but not limited to, the times when awards will be granted, the number of shares subject to each award, the award price, if any, and the time or times when each award will be settled, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (d) participation in the Plan is voluntary; (e) the value of the Award is an extraordinary item which is outside the scope of the Participant's employment contract, if any, unless expressly provided for in any such employment contract; (f) the Award is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including without limitation for calculating any benefits, severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments, and the Participant will have no entitlement to compensation or damages as a consequence of the forfeiture of any unvested portion of the Award as a result of the  

Participant s Termination of Service for any reason; (g) the future value of the Common Stock subject to the Award is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty, (h) neither the Plan, the Award nor the issuance of the shares underlying the Award confers upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of (or any other relationship with) the Company or any Subsidiary, nor do they limit in any respect the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the Participant s employment or other relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, at any time with or without Cause, and (i) the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary; and furthermore, the grant of the Award will not be interpreted to form an employment contract with the Company or any Subsidiary. 
            (a) 
    Notice  
     Whenever any notice is required or permitted hereunder, such notice must be in writing and delivered in person or by mail (to the address set forth below if notice is being delivered to the Company) or electronically.  Any notice delivered in person or by mail shall be deemed to be delivered on the date on which it is personally delivered, or, whether actually received or not, on the third business day after it is deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, addressed to the person who is to receive it at the address set forth in this Agreement.  Notices delivered to the Participant in person or by mail shall be addressed to the address for the Participant in the records of the Company.  Notices delivered to the Company in person or by mail shall be addressed as follows:  
  Company:    NRG Yield, Inc. 
  Attn: Deputy General Counsel   Corporate Secretary 
  804 Carnegie Center 
  Princeton, NJ 08540 
  The Company or the Participant may change, by written notice to the other, the address previously specified for receiving notices. 
           (b) 
    No Waiver 
     No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing and signed by the person against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced, nor will failure to enforce any right under this Agreement constitute a continuing waiver of the same or a waiver of any other right hereunder. 
           (c) 
    Undertaking 
     The Participant hereby agrees to take whatever additional action and execute whatever additional documents the Company may deem necessary or advisable in order to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions imposed on either the Participant or the Award pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement. 
           (d) 
    Entire Contract 
     This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement is made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and will in all respects be construed in conformity with the express terms and provisions of the Plan. 
           (e) 
    Successors and Assigns 
     The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding on, the Company and its successors and assigns and Participant and Participant's legal representatives, heirs, legatees, distributees, assigns and transferees by operation of law. 
           (f) 
    Securities Law Compliance 
     The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award.  The Company intends to maintain this registration but has no obligation to the Participant to do so.  If the registration ceases to be effective, the Participant will not be able to transfer or sell shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Award unless exemptions from registration under applicable securities laws are available.  Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might be unavailable.  Participant agrees that any resale of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Award shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and any other law, rule or regulation applicable thereto, as such laws, rules, and regulations  

may be amended from time to time.  The Company shall not be obligated to either issue shares of Common Stock or permit the resale of any such shares if such issuance or resale would violate any such requirements. 
           (g) 
    Taxes 
     Participant acknowledges that the removal of restrictions with respect to an RSU will give rise to a withholding tax liability, and that no shares of Common Stock are issuable hereunder until such withholding obligation is satisfied in full.  The Participant agrees to remit to the Company the amount of any taxes required to be withheld.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit Participant to satisfy all or part of such tax obligation through withholding of the number of shares of Stock otherwise issued to him or her hereunder and/or by the Participant transferring to the Company nonrestricted shares of Common Stock previously owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months prior to the vesting of the Award hereunder, with the amount of the withholding to be credited based on the current Fair Market Value of the Stock as of the date the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.   
           (h) 
    Information Confidential  
     As partial consideration for the granting of the Award, the Participant agrees that he or she will keep confidential all information and knowledge that the Participant has relating to the manner and amount of his or her participation in the Plan; provided, however, that such information may be disclosed as required by law and may be given in confidence to the Participant's spouse, tax and financial advisors, or to a financial institution to the extent that such information is necessary to secure a loan.   
           (i) 
    Governing Law  
     Except as may otherwise be provided in the Plan, the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. 
   Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the Committee determines that any Award granted under this Agreement is subject to Section 409A of the Code and fails to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan or in this Agreement, the Committee reserves the right to amend, restructure, terminate or replace the Award in order to cause the Award to either not be subject to Section 409A of the Code or to comply with the applicable provisions of such section.
