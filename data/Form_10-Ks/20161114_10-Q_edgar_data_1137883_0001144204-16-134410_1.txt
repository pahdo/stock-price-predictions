NOTE 1  -  
      GENERAL    

A.  Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc.
                                         (formerly: Golden Hand Resources Inc. - the  Company ) was incorporated in
                                         the State of Washington on September 22, 2000. The Company currently holds two wholly
                                         owned subsidiaries; Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd. ( BCT ), an Israeli Company
                                         which currently conducts all of the research and development activities of the Company,
                                         and Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics UK Ltd. ( Brainstorm UK ). Brainstorm UK
                                         acts on behalf of the parent Company in the EU. Brainstorm UK is currently inactive.   

  The
Common Stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol  BCLI .   

B.   The
                                         Company, through BCT, holds rights to commercialize certain stem cell technology developed
                                         by Ramot of Tel Aviv University Ltd. ( Ramot ), (see Note 3). Using this technology
                                         the Company has been developing novel adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative
                                         disorders such as Amytrophic Lateral Scelorosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gherig Disease),
                                         Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson s disease. The Company developed a proprietary
                                         process, called NurOwn, for the propagation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and their differentiation
                                         into neurotrophic factor secreting cells. These cells are then transplanted at or near
                                         the site of damage, offering the hope of more effectively treating neurodegenerative
                                         diseases.   The process is currently autologous,
                                         or self-transplanted.     

C.   NurOwn
                                         is in clinical development for the treatment of ALS. The Company has completed two single
                                         dose clinical trials of NurOwn in Israel, a phase 1/2 trial with 12 patients and a phase
                                         2a trial with additional 12 patients. In July 2016 the Company announced the results
                                         of its phase 2 trial which was conducted in three major medical centers in the US. This
                                         single dose trial included 48 patients randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive NuOwn or
                                         placebo.   Future development of NurOwn for ALS
                                         will require additional clinical trials typically required to provide an adequate basis
                                         for regulatory approval and product labeling. These additional trials will include the
                                         administration of repeated doses to ALS patients enrolled in these trials.     

D.   On September 15, 2014 the Company completed a reverse
stock split of the Company s shares of Common Stock by a ratio 1-for-15. The Company adjusted all ordinary shares, options,
warrants, per share data and exercise prices included in these financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the reverse
stock split. On August 26, 2015 the shareholders of the Company approved a reduction of the number of authorized shares of Common
Stock of the Company from 800,000,000 to 100,000,000. 

GOING CONCERN:  

To date the Company has not
generated any revenues from its activities and has incurred substantial operating losses. Management expects the Company to continue
to generate substantial operating losses and to continue to fund its operations primarily through utilization of its current financial
resources and through additional raises of capital. As of September 30, 2016 the Company s liquid resources which include
cash, cash equivalents and short term bank deposits amounted to $11,193. Management believes that, if necessary, the Company s
current resources would be sufficient to fund its operations for the next 24 months, however additional financial resources will
be needed to conduct our future clinical trials as well as fund other long term operations and there can be no assurance that
such additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or that the Company will not incur additional unforeseen
costs or expenses. Such conditions raise substantial doubts about the Company's long term ability to continue as a going concern.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets, carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

NOTE 2  -  
      BASIS OF PRESENTATION
    AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

A.  Unaudited Interim Financial Statements   

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise discussed).  

For
further information, reference is made to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Operating
results for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

B.  Significant Accounting Policies   

The
significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
are identical to those applied in the preparation of the latest annual financial statements.  

C.  Recent Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting
in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the
new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard
requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018; early adoption is prohibited.
The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the
cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. As the Company has not incurred revenues
to date, it is unable to determine to expected impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB
issued an amended standard requiring changes to recognition and measurement of certain financial assets and liabilities. The standard
primarily affects equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements
for financial instruments. This standard is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Certain provisions allow for early
adoption. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the financial position
or results of operations. 

In February 2016, the FASB
issued a new lease accounting standard requiring that we recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. This standard
is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019; early adoption is permitted. The Company have not yet determined the impact
of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2  -  
      BASIS OF PRESENTATION
    AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.):   

C.  Recent Accounting Standards (Cont.): 

In March 2016, the FASB issued
an accounting standard update aimed at simplifying the accounting for share-based payment transactions. Included in the update
are modifications to the accounting for income taxes upon vesting or settlement of awards, employer tax withholding on shared-based
compensation, forfeitures, and financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits. This standard is effective beginning in
the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have
a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued
a new standard requiring measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also
modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased
financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of
2020; early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating whether we will early adopt. It
is required to be applied on a modified-retrospective approach with certain elements being adopted prospectively. The Company
does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations. 

D.  Use of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  

NOTE 3  -    RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENT  

The
Company has a Research and License Agreement, as amended and restated, with Ramot. The Company obtained a waiver and release
from Ramot pursuant to which Ramot agreed to an amended payment schedule regarding the Company's payment obligations under
the Research and License Agreement and waived all claims against the Company resulting from the Company's previous defaults
and non-payment under the Research and License Agreement. The waiver and release amended and restated the original payment
schedule under the original agreement providing for payments during the initial research period and additional payments for
any extended research period. The Company is to pay Ramot royalties on Net Sales on a Licensed Product by Licensed Product
and jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as follows:

b)   In
                                         the event the making, producing, manufacturing, using, marketing, selling, importing
                                         or exporting of such Licensed Product is not covered by a Valid Claim and not covered
                                         by Orphan Drug status in such jurisdiction   3% of all Net Sales until the expiration
                                         of 15 years from the date of the First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product in such
                                         jurisdiction.

In
July 2007, the Company entered into an investment agreement, that was amended in August 2009 with ACCBT Corp. a company under
the control of the Company s current Chief Executive Officer, according to which for an aggregate consideration of approximately
$5 million the Company issued 2,777,777 shares of Common Stock and a warrant to purchase 672,222 shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of $3 per share and a warrant to purchase 1,344,444 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.35 per share.
The warrants are exercisable, through November 5, 2017.  

Our

In
February 2010, the Company issued an aggregate 399,999 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 199,998
shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $7.50 per share for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 million.

Company Overview    

We are a biotechnology company developing
novel adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ,
also known as Lou Gehrig s disease), Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ), and Parkinson s disease ( PD )
among others. These diseases for the most part have no or limited treatment options and as such represent unmet medical needs.
We believe that NurOwn , our proprietary process for the propagation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSC ) and their
differentiation into neurotrophic factor-( NTF ) secreting cells ( MSC-NTF  cells), and their transplantation
at, or near, the site of damage, offers the hope of more effectively treating neurodegenerative diseases. Our core technology was
developed in collaboration with Prof. Daniel Offen of the Felsenstein Medical Research Center of Tel Aviv University and the late
Prof. Eldad Melamed, who passed away in October 2015, and was former head of Neurology of the Rabin Medical Center and former member
of the Scientific Committee of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Brainstorm
Cell Therapeutics Ltd. (the  Israeli Subsidiary ), holds exclusive rights to commercialize the technology, through
a licensing agreement with Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. ( Ramot ), the technology transfer company of Tel Aviv
University, Israel. We currently employ 17 employees in Israel and 2 in the United States. 

Our Proprietary Technology  

Our NurOwn  technology is based on
a novel differentiation protocol which induces differentiation of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into neuron-supporting
cells, MSC-NTF cells, capable of releasing several neurotrophic factors, including, among others, Glial-derived neurotrophic factor
( GDNF ), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ), Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF )
and Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) which are critical for the growth, survival and differentiation of developing
neurons. GDNF is one of the most potent survival factors known for peripheral neurons. GDNF, VEGF and HGF have been reported to
have important neuro-protective effects in ALS and are currently evaluated separately and independently in other clinical trials
for ALS patients. 

Our approach to treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases with autologous adult stem cells includes a multi-step process beginning with harvesting of undifferentiated mesenchymal
stem cells from the patient's own bone marrow, and concluding with transplantation of differentiated, neurotrophic factor-secreting
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-NTF) into the same patient   intrathecally and/or intramuscularly. Intrathecal (injection into
the cerebrospinal fluid) transplantation consists of injection by a standard lumbar puncture; there is no need for a laminectomy,
which is an invasive, orthopedic spine operation to remove a portion of the vertebral bone, as required by technologies in which
cells are implanted directly into the spinal cord. Intramuscular (injection directly into muscle) transplantation is performed
via a standard injection procedure as well. 

Our proprietary, production process for
induction of differentiation of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into differentiated cells that produce NTF (MSC-NTF
cells, NurOwn ) for clinical use is conducted in full compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP ). 

Our proprietary technology is licensed to and developed by our
Israeli Subsidiary. 

The NurOwn      Cell Therapy
Process   

Bone marrow aspiration from patient;   

Isolation and propagation of the mesenchymal stem cells;   

Differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells into neurotrophic-factor secreting (MSC-NTF) cells; and   

Autologous transplantation into the patient s spinal cord and/or muscle tissue.   

Differentiation before Transplantation   

The ability to induce differentiation of autologous adult mesenchymal
stem cells into MSC-NTF cells  before  transplantation is unique to NurOwn , making it the first-of-its-kind for treating
neurodegenerative diseases. 

The specialized cells secrete neurotrophic factors that may
lead to: 

Protection of existing motor neurons;   

Promotion of motor neuron growth; and   

Re-establishment of nerve-muscle interaction.   

Autologous (Self-transplantation)   

The NurOwn  approach is autologous, or self-transplanted,
using the patient s own stem cells. In autologous transplantation there is no risk of rejection and no need for treatment
with immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long-term side effects. In addition, the use of adult stem cells is
free of controversy associated with the use of embryonic stem cells in some countries. 

Cryopreservation  

We have developed a proprietary method
for cryopreservation, or freezing, of cells, which enables long-term storage, for the production of repeat patient doses of NurOwn 
without the need for additional bone marrow aspirations. Cryopreservation enables us to create a personalized NurOwn  stem
cell  bank  for each patient, for, repeated treatments.  

The ALS Program  

NurOwn  is in clinical development
for the treatment of ALS. It has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA )
and Orphan Drug Designation in both the United States and in Europe for this indication. To date we have completed three clinical
trials for ALS patients. Two open label studies were carried out at the Hadassah Medical center ( Hadassah ) in Israel
and an FDA-approved Phase 2, double blind, placebo controlled study was recently completed at three prestigious U.S. medical centers. 

Israeli
trial s    

We have an agreement with Hadasit Medical
Research Services and Development Ltd., a subsidiary of the Hadassah Medical Organization, pursuant to which Hadassah provides
the Israeli Subsidiary with lab services relating to studies of NurOwn . 

The
Principal Investigator (PI) for the Israeli studies was Professor Dimitrios Karussis, MD, PhD, Professor in Neurology head of the
MS Centere and    Unit of Neuroimmunology and Cell Therapies
at Hadassah's Department of Neurology.  

The first two open label studies, carried
out at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01051882 and NCT01777646) confirmed
the treatment was safe and well tolerated either by the IT or by the IM route of administration as well as by the combined IT and
IM administration, and showed some initial indications of efficacy, slowing the slope of disease progression. 

The Phase 1/2 first-in-man study was aimed
at evaluating the safety of a single initial dose of MSC-NTF cells administered by two different routes. MSC-NTF cells were administered
intramuscularly (IM) in a cohort of six early stage ALS patients and intrathecally (IT) in six ALS patients with more progressive
disease. This study established safety of administration of MSC-NTF cells via IT and IM at these IM and IT doses. 

The Phase 2a trial was
a dose-escalating study in three cohorts of 4 early-stage ALS patients aimed at evaluating safety and collecting efficacy
data of the combined IT and IM administration. This study established the higher doses to be safe and showed early signs of
change in slope in the ALSFRS-R post treatment compared to the slope pre-treatment. In both these studies, patients were
followed for 3 months before and 6 months after transplantation. Additional outcome measures in these studies included change
in: muscle strength grading (MVIC) by grip, forced vital capacity (FVC %), muscle bulk estimated by MRI of the upper
extremities, upper and lower extremities circumference (cm), electromyography (EMG) parameters. 

In January 2016, the Company announced
that the results from the Phase 1/2 and Phase 2a studies conducted in Israel were published in the  Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology . The results of these studies show that intrathecal administration of NurOwn   
can slow disease progression in ALS. 

U.S. Phase 2 Study  

On April 28, 2014, we initiated an FDA-approved
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating NurOwn  in ALS patients. The
trial was conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts, at the University of Massachusetts Memorial
Hospital (UMass) in Worcester, Massachusetts and at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The Principal Investigators for the
study were Drs. Merit Cudkowicz and James Berry at MGH, Dr. Robert Brown, at UMass and Dr. Anthony Windebank, at the Mayo clinic.
For this study, NurOwn  was manufactured at the Connell and O Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts and at the Human Cellular Therapy Lab at the Mayo Clinic. In the study 48 patients were
randomized 3:1 to receive NurOwn  or placebo. 

On July 18, 2016 the Company presented
top line data from this study in a press release and investor conference call. The Company announced that the study achieved its
primary objective, demonstrating that NurOwn     was safe and well tolerated. NurOwn    also achieved
multiple secondary efficacy endpoints, showing clear evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit. Notably, response rates were
higher for NurOwn    -treated subjects compared to placebo at all time points in the study out to 24 weeks. 

Planned Multi Dose Phase 2 Study at
Hadassah  

In January 2016, the Company entered into
a collaborative agreement with Hadassah to conduct the planned multi dose Phase 2 trial with NurOwn  in ALS. The agreement
was signed with Hadassah, through its technology transfer company Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Co. Ltd. The
Principal Investigator will be Professor Dimitrios Karussis, who served as Principal Investigator in the Company s prior
ALS studies.  

This planned multi dose study will be the
Company s third clinical trial conducted at Hadassah and is designed to provide guidance in preparing a Phase 3 program for
NurOwn   .  The trial is expected to enroll up to 24 ALS patients who will receive three consecutive stem cell
transplantations in order to explore the safety and efficacy of a multi dose treatment.  The trial was submitted to the Hadassah's
Helsinki Committee and is now awaiting the approval of the Israeli MoH. 

The Company is currently considering the possibility of
increasing the number of patients and participating clinical sites in this trial in order to increase the statistical power of
the study. The advantage of a higher sample size would be that, if NurOwn     shows a clinical benefit in ALS patients,
there is a better probability for an efficacy outcome that is statistically significant. 

Future development of NurOwn  in ALS
will require additional clinical trials, including a Phase 3 FDA-approved multi dose trial.   

In addition the Company is exploring the
possible commencement of a program to make NurOwn  available to a limited number of patients with ALS through a regulatory
pathway designated for an orphan drug with a good safety profile and strong efficacy signals.  This program would potentially
provide patients, who today face an unmet need, with access to this investigational treatment before it receives final marketing
approval from the regulatory authorities. 

Future Development Plans  

In
addition to its active clinical program in ALS, the Company is reviewing the potential clinical development of NurOwn  in other
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Progressive Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson s disease, and Huntington s disease.
The Company has conducted preclinical research in additional neurologic disease areas, including autism. In January 2015, the Company
announced positive results from preclinical studies of NurOwn    in the BTBR mouse model of autism. The BTBR mouse
exhibits several stereotypical behavioral characteristics that resemble behaviors seen in autism spectrum disorders, including
repetitive behaviors, altered social interactions, cognitive rigidity and impaired adaption to environment   .  

In addition, the
Company is engaged in a number of research initiatives to improve the scale and efficiency of NurOwn  production and to improve
the stability of NurOwn   , which is currently produced in clean room facilities close to the clinical trial sites,
where the cells are administered to patients. 

We are currently
developing technology for the long distance shipping of NurOwn   . This technology will enable the Company to transport
the NurOwn     from central production facilities to clinics around the world. 

We are also engaged
in  a  collaboration with Octane Biotech Inc. ( Octane ), a Canadian firm that focuses
on culture systems for cell and tissue therapy, to develop a NurOwn  bioreactor. On June 27, 2014, the Company announced that
this collaboration has successfully developed a sophisticated Alpha prototype of the NurOwn  Bioreactor, utilizing a customized
disposable cartridge that is dedicated to the intricacies of the Company's NurOwn  process.  Based on this first working
prototype, the Company and Octane are advancing to the next stage of development with a goal of eventually qualifying a bioreactor
for full clinical use. In December 2015, the Company and Octane announced that they have made significant progress toward the development
of a novel bioreactor for industrial-scale manufacture of NurOwn  and had completed key development activities related
to the customization of specific features of Octane s Cocoon  instrumentation platform to enable efficient delivery
of NurOwn  stem cell therapy. Additional scale-up/closed system technologies are also under evaluation.

Results of Operations  

For the period from inception (September
22, 2000) until September 30, 2016, the Company has not earned any revenues from operations. The Company does not expect to earn
revenues from operations until at least 2020, if ever. In addition, the Company has incurred operating costs and other expenses
of approximately $1,638,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Research and Development, net:  

Research and development expenses, net
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $790,000 and $1,503,000, respectively, representing a decrease of $713,000.
During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded Chief Scientists grants of $96,000 a decrease of $503,000 compared
to $599,000 recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and development expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 before participation of the Chief Scientist declined by $1,216,000 compared with the third
quarter of 2015. This decrease is due to a decrease of $1,396,000 for costs of activities related to the U.S. Clinical Trial which
were winding down in the third quarter of 2016 including fees to PRC Clinical and regulatory consultants, fees to DFCI and fees
to the Mayo Clinic, offset by an increase of $69,000 in costs associated with the clinical trial, planned to be conducted in Israel
and a net increase of $111,000 of other research and development expenses. 

General and Administrative:  

General and administrative expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $848,000 and $1,068,000, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative
expenses of $220,000 is primarily due to: a decrease of $113,000 in stock-based compensation expenses and, a decrease of $110,000
in payroll costs offset by a net increase of $3,000 of other costs. The decline in payroll expenses was primarily due to the 2015
incurrance of one time severance costs, in connection with the termination of employment of our former Chief Executive Officer. 

Financial Expenses:  

Financial income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $32,000, as compared to financial expenses of $32,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
main reason for high level of financial income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was the impact of the 2% strengthening
of the New Israeli Shekel vs. the U.S. Dollar on the Company s deposits denominated in New Israeli Shekels. 

Net Loss:  

Net loss for the three months ended on
September 30, 2016 was $1,606,000, as compared to a net loss of $2,603,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss
per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.09 and $0.14, respectively. 

The weighted average number of shares of
Common Stock used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 18,656,615,
compared to 18,480,957 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has financed its operations
since inception primarily through public and private sales of its Common Stock and warrants and the issuance of convertible promissory
notes. At September 30, 2016, the Company had net working capital of $10,190,000 including cash, cash equivalents and short term
bank deposits amounting to $11,193,000. 

Net cash used in operating activities was
$275,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Cash used for operating activities was primarily attributed to cost of
clinical trials, rent of clean rooms and materials for clinical trials, payroll costs, rent, outside legal fee expenses and public
relations expenses. Net cash provided by investing activities was $286,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing
net change in short term interest bearing bank deposits. There were no financing activities during the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

On June 4, 2015, we filed a shelf registration
statement, effective June 10, 2015, relating to Common Stock, warrants and units that we may sell from time to time in one or more
offerings, up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. We have not filed any supplemental prospectus defining particular terms
of securities to be offered under the shelf registration statement. 

Our material cash needs for the next 24
months, assuming we do not expand our clinical trials beyond the upcoming multi dose clinical trial in Israel, will include (i)
costs of the clinical trial in the U.S. which are winding down in 2016 (ii) employee salaries, (iii) costs expected for the upcoming
multi-dose clinical trial in Israel, (iv) payments to Hadassah for rent and operation of the GMP facilities, and (v) fees to our
consultants and legal advisors, patents, and fees for facilities to be used in our research and development. 

Future operations are expected to be highly
capital intensive and will require substantial capital raisings. We expect our current cash position will allow us to meet our
obligations in the upcoming 24 months (assuming the multi dose clinical trial will include 24 patients and will not be expanded
into a power trial). 

Over the longer term if we are not able
to raise substantial additional capital, we may not be able to continue to function as a going concern and may have to cease operations
or the Company will reduce its costs, including curtailing its current plan to pursue larger clinical trials in ALS and move new
indications into clinical testing. We will be required to raise a substantial amount of capital in the future in order to reach
profitability and to complete the commercialization of our products. Our ability to fund these future capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including the following:  

our ability to obtain funding from third parties, including any future collaborative partners;   

the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development programs;   

the time and costs required to gain regulatory approvals;   

the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;   

the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents, patent applications, patent claims, trademarks and other
intellectual property rights;   

the effect of competition and market developments; and   

future pre-clinical and clinical trial results. 

Critical Accounting Policies    

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates,
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually
evaluate our judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on the terms of underlying agreements, our expected course
of development, historical experience and other factors we believe are reasonable based on the circumstances, the results of which
form our management s basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

There were no significant changes to our
critical accounting policies during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. For information about critical accounting policies, see
the discussion of critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

This information has been omitted as the
Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

As of the end of the period covered by
this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of
the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There have been no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

From time to time, we may become involved
in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business, which we consider routine and incidental
to our business. We currently are not a party to any material legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s
opinion, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

There have not been any material changes
from the risk factors previously disclosed in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
