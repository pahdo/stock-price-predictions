  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

1.  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"); therefore, they do not include all disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Such statements are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of results for the selected interim periods.  Users of financial information produced for interim periods are encouraged to refer to the footnotes contained in the audited consolidated financial statements appearing in Security Federal Corporation s (the  Company ) 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders which was filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 10-K ) when reviewing interim financial statements.  

2.  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Bank (the  Bank ) and the Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries, Security Federal Insurance, Inc. ( SFINS ) and Security Financial Services Corporation ( SFSC ).  SFINS was formed during fiscal 2002 and began operating during the December 2001 quarter and is an insurance agency offering auto, business, and home insurance.  SFINS has a wholly owned subsidiary, Collier Jennings Financial Corporation, which has as subsidiaries Security Federal Auto Insurance, The Auto Insurance Store Inc., and Security Federal Premium Pay Plans Inc. Security Federal Premium Pay Plans Inc. has one wholly owned premium finance subsidiary and also has an ownership interest in four other premium finance subsidiaries. SFSC was formed in 1975 and is currently inactive.  
    
  The Company has a wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Statutory Trust (the  Trust ), which issued and sold fixed and floating rate capital securities of the Trust.  However, under current accounting guidance, the Trust is not consolidated in the Company s financial statements.  The Bank is primarily engaged in the business of accepting savings and demand deposits and originating mortgage loans and other loans to individuals and small businesses for various personal and commercial purposes. 

3.  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company has adopted various accounting policies, which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation of our financial statements.  Our significant accounting policies are described in the footnotes to the audited consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2015 included in our 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.  We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies.  The judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we make, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on our carrying values of assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 
    
  The Company believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The impact of an unexpected and sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings. The Company provides for loan losses using the allowance method.  Accordingly, all loan losses are charged to the related allowance and all recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses.  Additions to the allowance for loan losses are provided by charges to operations based on various factors, which, in management s judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating possible losses.  Such factors considered by management include the fair value of the underlying collateral, stated guarantees by the borrower (if applicable), the borrower s ability to repay from other economic resources, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to the outstanding loans, loss experience, delinquency trends, and general economic conditions.  Management evaluates the carrying value of the loans periodically and the allowance is adjusted accordingly.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

3.  Critical Accounting Policies, Continued 
    
  While management uses the best information available to make evaluations, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making these evaluations.  The allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluations by our bank regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"), the FDIC and the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions, that may require adjustments to be made to the allowance based upon the information that is available at the time of their examination.   
    
  The Company values impaired loans at the loan s fair value if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement at the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, if available, or the value of the underlying collateral.  Expected cash flows are required to be discounted at the loan s effective interest rate.  When the ultimate collectibility of an impaired loan s principal is in doubt, wholly or partially, all cash receipts are applied to principal.  When this doubt does not exist, cash receipts are applied under the contractual terms of the loan agreement first to interest and then to principal.  Once the recorded principal balance has been reduced to zero, future cash receipts are applied to interest income to the extent that any interest has been foregone.  Further cash receipts are recorded as recoveries of any amounts previously charged off. 
    
  The Company uses assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns, and income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. The Company exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments and estimates are reevaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. No assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by us or the income tax reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the United States Tax Court, changes in the tax code, or assessments made by the Internal Revenue Service. 

4.  Earnings Per Common Share 
    
  Accounting guidance specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share ( EPS ) for entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock such as options, warrants, convertible securities or contingent stock agreements if those securities trade in a public market. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive common shares had been issued.  The dilutive effect of options outstanding under the Company s stock option plan is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. 
    
  Net income available to common shareholders represents consolidated net income adjusted for preferred dividends declared, accretions of discounts and amortization of premiums on preferred stock issuances and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end.  
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to net income available to common shareholders for the periods presented:

  The following tables include a summary of the Company's basic and diluted EPS for the periods indicated.     

5.  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Certain officers and directors of the Company participate in incentive and non-qualified stock option plans. Options are granted at exercise prices not less than the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The following is a summary of the activity under the Company s stock option plans for the periods presented:

5.  Stock-Based Compensation, Continued 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following options outstanding: 

None   of the options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   2015   had an exercise price below the average market price during the three or   nine month period  s ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . Therefore, these options were not deemed to be dilutive to EPS in those periods.

6.  Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities, Available For Sale 
    
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair values of investment and mortgage-backed securities available for sale at the dates indicated were as follows: 

The FHLB, FFCB, FNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ) are government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs") and the securities and bonds issued by GSEs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.  SBA bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Included in the tables above and below in mortgage-backed securities are Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") mortgage-backed securities, which are also backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.  At   September 30, 2016   the Bank held an amortized cost and fair value of   $112.4 million   and   $115.0 million  , respectively, in GNMA mortgage-backed securities included in mortgage-backed securities listed above compared to an amortized cost and fair value of   $116.8 million   and   $118.5 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Also included in mortgage-backed securities in the tables above and below are private label collateralized mortgage obligation ("CMO") securities. These securities are issued by non-governmental real estate mortgage investment conduits, which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.  At   September 30, 2016   the Bank held an amortized cost and fair value of   $18.6 million   and   $18.3 million  , respectively, in private label CMO mortgage-backed securities, which are included in mortgage-backed securities in the table above, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of   $3.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

6.  Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities, Available For Sale, Continued 
    
  The amortized cost and fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities available for sale at   September 30, 2016   are shown below by contractual maturity.  Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Since mortgage-backed securities are not due at a single maturity date, they are disclosed separately, rather than allocated over the maturity groupings set forth in the table below.  

At   September 30, 2016   the amortized cost and fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities available for sale pledged as collateral for certain deposit accounts, FHLB advances and other borrowings were   $71.6 million   and   $74.1 million  , respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of   $81.0 million   and   $83.2 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Bank received   $6.9 million   and   $4.0 million   in gross proceeds from sales of available for sale securities during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As a result, the Bank recognized gross gains of   $360,000   and   $8,000  , respectively, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , with   no   gross losses recognized for the same periods.  
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank received   $21.5 million   and   $58.2 million  , respectively,  in gross proceeds from sales of available for sale securities.  As a result, the Bank recognized gross gains of   $772,000   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, and gross losses of   $0   and   $47,000  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The following tables show gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category, and length of time that the individual available for sale securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at the dates indicated.

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

6.  Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities, Available For Sale, Continued 
    
  Securities classified as available for sale are recorded at fair market value.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   21.3%   and   17.6%   of the unrealized losses, representing   13   and   nine   individual securities, respectively, consisted of securities in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature.  The Company believes, based on industry analyst reports and credit ratings, that the deterioration in value is attributable to changes in market interest rates and is not in the credit quality of the issuer and therefore, these losses are not considered other-than-temporary. The Company reviews its investment securities portfolio at least quarterly and more frequently when economic conditions warrant, assessing whether there is any indication of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ).  
    
  Factors considered in the review include estimated future cash flows, length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the security to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. If the review determines that there is OTTI, then an impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made, or the Company may recognize a portion in other comprehensive income. The fair value of investments on which OTTI is recognized then becomes the new cost basis of the investment.  There was no OTTI recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  

7.  Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities, Held to Maturity 
    
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair values of held to maturity securities at the dates indicated below were as follows:

  Other than the mortgage-backed securities included above, there were no other investment securities classified as held to maturity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held an amortized cost and fair value of   $17.5 million   and   $17.8 million  , respectively in GNMA mortgage-backed securities, which are included in the table above, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of   $20.5 million   and   $20.4 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . The Company has not invested in any private label mortgage-backed securities classified as held to maturity. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost and fair value of mortgage-backed securities held to maturity that were pledged as collateral for certain deposit accounts, FHLB advances and other borrowings were   $25.0 million   and   $25.5 million  , respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value of   $26.0 million   and   $25.8 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .

8.    Loans Receivable, Net 
    
  Loans receivable, net, consisted of the following as of the dates indicated below: 

The Company uses a risk based approach based on the following credit quality measures when analyzing the loan portfolio: pass, caution, special mention, and substandard. These indicators are used to rate the credit quality of loans for the purposes of determining the Company s allowance for loan losses. Pass loans are loans that are performing and are deemed adequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or the underlying collateral value. These loans are considered to have the least amount of risk in terms of determining the allowance for loan losses. Loans that are graded as substandard are considered to have the most risk. These loans typically have an identified weakness or weaknesses and are inadequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or collateral value.  All loans   90   days or more past due are automatically classified in this category. The caution and special mention categories fall in between the pass and substandard grades and consist of loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but possess weaknesses.  
    
  The following tables list the loan grades used by the Company as credit quality indicators and the balance for each loan category at the dates presented, excluding loans held for sale.

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any loans that were   90   days or more past due and still accruing interest. Our strategy is to work with our borrowers to reach acceptable payment plans while protecting our interests in the existing collateral.  In the event an acceptable arrangement cannot be reached, we may have to acquire these properties through foreclosure or other means and subsequently sell, develop, or liquidate them.

  Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired management measures the impairment and records the loan at fair value. Fair value is estimated using one of the following methods: fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sale, discounted cash flows, or market value of the loan based on similar debt. The fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell is the most frequently used method. Typically, the Company reviews the most recent appraisal and, if it is over   24   months old, will request a new third party appraisal. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the loan, including the location of the collateral, the date of the most recent appraisal and the value of the collateral relative to the recorded investment in the loan, management may order an independent appraisal immediately or, in some instances, may elect to perform an internal analysis. The average balance of impaired loans was   $10.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $14.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .

  In the course of resolving delinquent loans, the Bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans.  A troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") is a restructuring in which the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider (Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 310-40).  The concessions granted on TDRs generally include terms to reduce the interest rate, extend the term of the debt obligation, or modify the payment structure on the debt obligation. The Bank grants such concessions to reassess the borrower s financial status and develop a plan for repayment.  TDRs included in impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were     $5.2 million     and   $6.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  Loans on nonaccrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as nonaccrual TDRs. Loans on accruing status at the date of concession are initially classified as accruing TDRs if the loan is reasonably assured of repayment and performance is expected in accordance with its modified terms. Such loans may be designated as nonaccrual loans subsequent to the concession date if reasonable doubt exists as to the collection of interest or principal under the restructuring agreement. Nonaccrual TDRs are returned to accruing status when there is economic substance to the restructuring, there is documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition, the remaining balance is reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with its modified terms, and the borrower has demonstrated sustained repayment performance in accordance with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time (generally a minimum of six months). 
    
  The Bank did not modify any loans that were considered to be TDRs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The following table is a summary of loans restructured as TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Bank modified six loans that were considered to be TDRs, three of which were modified during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The Bank lowered the interest rate on two of the loans to allow the borrowers to begin making monthly principal and interest payments and changed the monthly payment to interest only for an agreed upon period for the other four loans.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   six   loans totaling   $765,000   that had previously been restructured as TDRs were in default, none of which had been restructured within the last 12 months.    Three   of the loans, with a balance of   $637,000  , defaulted during the   nine month period   ended   September 30, 2016  .  In comparison, at   September 30, 2015  ,   three   loans totaling   $684,000   that had previously been restructured as TDRs were in default, and   two   of the loans, with a balance of   $555,000   defaulted during the   nine month period  . The Bank considers any loan   30   days or more past due to be in default.  
    
  Our policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured as a TDR follows relevant supervisory guidance.  That is, if a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is probable.  If a borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual going forward.  Lastly, if the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status. 
    
  We closely monitor these loans and will cease accruing interest on them if management believes that the borrowers may not continue performing based on the restructured note terms.  If, after previously being classified as a TDR, a loan is restructured a second time, then that loan is automatically placed on nonaccrual status.  Our policy with respect to nonperforming loans requires the borrower to make a minimum of   six   consecutive payments in accordance with the modified loan terms before that loan can be placed back on accrual status.  In addition to this payment history, the borrower must demonstrate an ability to continue making payments on the loan prior to restoration of accrual status.

9.  Regulatory Matters 
    
  As a state-chartered, federally insured commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the capital requirements established by the FDIC. Under the FDIC s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
    
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to total average assets (as defined), and minimum ratios of Tier 1 total capital (as defined) and common equity Tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined). 
    
  In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in starting in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. 
    
  The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.  For a bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.  If Security Federal Corporation was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in assets, at   September 30, 2016  , it would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

10.  Carrying Amounts and Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company has adopted accounting guidance which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements; accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances. 
    
  Accounting guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 
                 Level 1 
    Valuation is based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. 
      Level 2 
    Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments, mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain derivative contracts. 
      Level 3 
    Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 
    
  Investment Securities Available for Sale 
    
  Investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s investment portfolio was comprised of government and agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies or GSEs, private label CMO mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, and   two   equity investments. Fair value measurement is based upon prices obtained from third party pricing services that use independent pricing models which rely on a variety of factors including reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark yields, economic and industry events and other relevant market information. As a result, these securities are classified as Level 2. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 
    
  The Company originates fixed rate residential loans on a servicing released basis in the secondary market. Loans closed but not yet settled with the FHLMC or other investors, are carried in the Company s loans held for sale portfolio.  These loans are fixed rate residential loans that have been originated in the Company s name and have closed.  Virtually all of these loans have commitments to be purchased by investors and the majority of these loans were locked in by price with the investors on the same day or shortly thereafter that the loan was locked in with the Company s customers.  Therefore, these loans present very little market risk for the Company. 
    
  The Company usually delivers a commitment to, and receives funding from, the investor within   30 days  .  Commitments to sell these loans to the investor are considered derivative contracts and are sold to investors on a  best efforts" basis. The Company is not obligated to deliver a loan or pay a penalty if a loan is not delivered to the investor. As a result of the short-term nature of these derivative contracts, the fair value of the mortgage loans held for sale in most cases is the same as the value of the loan amount at its origination  .   These loans are classified as Level 2.

  Impaired Loans 
    
  The Company does not record loans held for investment at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established as necessary. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as impaired, management measures the impairment by determining the fair value of the collateral for the loan. 
    
  Fair value is estimated using one of the following methods: fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, discounted cash flows, or market value of the loan based on similar debt. The fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell is the most frequently used method. Typically, the Company reviews the most recent appraisal and if it is over   24 months   old will request a new third party appraisal. Depending on the particular circumstances surrounding the loan, including the location of the collateral, the date of the most recent appraisal and the value of the collateral relative to the recorded investment in the loan, management may order an independent appraisal immediately or, in some instances, may elect to perform an internal analysis. Specifically as an example, in situations where the collateral on a nonperforming commercial real estate loan is out of the Company s primary market area, management would typically order an independent appraisal immediately, at the earlier of the date the loan becomes nonperforming or immediately following the determination that the loan is impaired. However, as a second example, on a nonperforming commercial real estate loan where management is familiar with the property and surrounding areas and where the original appraisal value far exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, management may perform an internal analysis whereby the previous appraisal value would be reviewed and adjusted for current conditions including recent sales of similar properties in the area and any other relevant economic trends. These valuations are reviewed at a minimum on a quarterly basis. 
    
  Impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. At   September 30, 2016  , our impaired loans were generally evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral. Impaired loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. The Company records impaired loans as nonrecurring Level 3. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the recorded investment in impaired loans was   $9.8 million   and   $12.6 million  , respectively.  
    
  Foreclosed Assets 
    
  Foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 3. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the asset as nonrecurring Level 3.  
    
  Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

For assets and liabilities that are not presented on the balance sheet at fair value, the following methods are used to determine the fair value: 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value. All mature within   90 days   and do not present unanticipated credit concerns. 
    
  Certificates of Deposit with Other Banks Fair value is based on market prices for similar assets. 
    
  Investment Securities Held to Maturity Securities held to maturity are valued at quoted market prices or dealer quotes. 
    
  Loans Receivable, Net The fair value of loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. As discount rates are based on current loan rates as well as management estimates, the fair values presented may not be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale. 
    
  FHLB Stock The fair value approximates the carrying value. 
    
  Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  FHLB Advances Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using current market rates for advances with similar terms. 
    
  Other Borrowed Money The carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value. 
    
  Senior Convertible Debentures  The fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar debenture offerings with similar terms and maturities would be issued by similar institutions. As discount rates are based on current debenture rates as well as management estimates, the fair values presented may not be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale. 
    
  Junior Subordinated Debentures The carrying value of junior subordinated debentures approximates fair value.

10.  Carrying Amounts and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Continued 
    
  The following tables are a summary of the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   presented in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $70.0 million   of off-balance sheet financial commitments.  These commitments are to originate loans and unused consumer lines of credit and credit card lines.  Because these obligations are based on current market rates, if funded, the original principal amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Fair value estimates are made on a specific date, based on relevant market data and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale the Bank s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

10.  Carrying Amounts and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Continued 
    
  Because no active market exists for a significant portion of the Bank s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, current interest rates and prepayment trends, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in any of these assumptions used in calculating fair value would also significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.  For example, the Bank has significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities including deposit franchise values, loan servicing portfolios, deferred tax liabilities, and premises and equipment. 
    
  In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates. The Company has used management s best estimate of fair value on the above assumptions.  Thus, the fair values presented may not be the amounts, which could be realized, in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.  In addition, any income taxes or other expenses that would be incurred in an actual sale or settlement are not taken into consideration in the fair value presented. 

11.  Accounting and Reporting Changes 
    
  The following is a summary of recent authoritative pronouncements that could affect accounting, reporting, and disclosure of financial information by the Company: 
    
  In January 2014, the FASB amended the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures topic of the ASC to address accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects.  If certain conditions are met, the amendments permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects by amortizing the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizing the net investment performance in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit).  If those conditions are not met, the investment should be accounted for as an equity method investment or a cost method investment in accordance with existing accounting guidance.  The amendments were effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and were applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The amendments did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.   
    
  In May 2014 and August 2015, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will apply the guidance using a modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance which makes limited amendments to the guidance on accounting for certain repurchase agreements. The new guidance (1) requires entities to account for repurchase-to-maturity transactions as secured borrowings (rather than as sales with forward repurchase agreements), (2) eliminates accounting guidance on linked repurchase financing transactions, and (3) expands disclosure requirements related to certain transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as sales and certain transfers (specifically, repos, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions) accounted for as secured borrowings. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. These amendments did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that performance targets associated with stock compensation should be treated as a performance condition and should not be reflected in the grant date fair value of the stock award. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  These amendments did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

11.  Accounting and Reporting Changes, Continued 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the consolidation requirements and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP. Although the amendments are expected to result in the deconsolidation of many entities, the Company will need to reevaluate all its previous consolidation conclusions. The amendments were effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  These amendments did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of the ASC to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the amendments.  The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the ASC to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the ASC to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties.     The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows.  Additionally, the guidance simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities allowing them apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions that have certain characteristics and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all liability-classified awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value.  The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the ASC to clarify guidance related to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the ASC to clarify guidance related to collectability, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt securities. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard will have on its consolidated  financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In August 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of the ASC to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.  
  Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting authorities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. Recognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. Nonrecognized subsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date.  Management has reviewed all events occurring through the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued and determined that the following subsequent event required disclosure. 
    
  On September 29, 2010, the Company issued 22,000 shares of Series B Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock to the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ) in connection with its participation in the Community Development Capital Initiative.  
    
  On October 31, 2016, the Company repurchased all 22,000 shares of its Series B Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock from Treasury for a repurchase amount of $21.3 million plus accrued but unpaid interest of $93,000 for a total payment amount of $21.4 million. In connection with this repurchase, the Company obtained a $14 million term loan with another financial institution. The loan accrues and pays interest quarterly at a floating rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime index minus 30 basis points.  The note matures on October 1, 2019.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances after the date hereof. These risks could cause our actual results for 2016 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements by or on behalf of us, and could negatively affect the Company s financial condition, liquidity and operating and stock price performance. 

Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015    
    
  Assets    
  Total assets increased   $24.2 million   or   3.0%   to   $823.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $799.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The primary reason for the increase in total assets was an increase of $21.2 million or 6.4% in loans receivable. The increases and decreases in total assets were primarily concentrated in the following asset categories: 

Cash and cash equivalents increased   $3.0 million   or   35.4%   to $  11.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $8.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Investment and mortgage-backed securities available for sale increased   $5.5 million   or   1.5%   to   $381.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $375.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Investment and mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased   $2.4 million   or   8.0%   to   $27.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $29.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Bank purchased 45 investment and mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale for $68.0 million and one mortgage-backed security classified as held to maturity for $1.5 million during the nine months ended of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Loans receivable, net, increased   $21.2 million   or   6.4%   to   $351.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $330.6 million   at   December 31, 2015   as a result of increased loan originations in all loan categories. Residential real estate loans increased $4.7 million or 6.1%  
  
   35 

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

to   $81.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $76.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Commercial real estate loans increased $11.8 million or 5.9% to   $211.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $200.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Commercial business loans increased $3.7 million or 29.8% to   $16.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $12.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Consumer loans increased $307,000 or 0.6% to   $50.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $50.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Loans held for sale increased $1.7 million or 68.3% to   $4.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $2.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  .   
  OREO decreased   $2.0 million   or   46.6%   to   $2.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $4.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease was due to the sale of 14 OREO properties during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   with a total book value of $2.3 million offset slightly by the addition of four OREO properties with a total book value of $324,000.  At   September 30, 2016  , OREO consisted of the following real estate properties: six single-family residences and 23 lots within residential subdivisions located throughout our market areas in South Carolina and Georgia; four parcels of commercial land in South Carolina; one commercial building in South Carolina; and eight lots within a residential subdivision and the adjacent 22.96 acres of land in Aiken, South Carolina.     
  Premises and equipment, net increased   $547,000   or   2.7%   to   $20.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $20.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to additions to construction in progress related to the construction of the Bank's new branch in Evans, Georgia, which is scheduled to open in early 2017.   
  The cash value of BOLI increased   $396,000   or   2.4%   to   $17.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $16.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . BOLI, which earns tax-free yields, is utilized to partially offset the cost of the Bank s employee benefits programs and to provide key person insurance on certain officers of the Company. 
  FHLB stock increased   $460,000   or   20.8%   to   $2.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.2 million   at   December 31, 2015   as a result of an increase in advances from the FHLB. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta in an amount equal to a membership component, which is 0.09% of total assets, plus a transaction component, which is 4.25% of outstanding advances (borrowings) from the FHLB of Atlanta. As the Bank's total advances have increased, so has its required investment in FHLB stock.      
  Other assets decreased   $2.3 million   or   52.6%   to   $2.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $4.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of a $2.0 million decrease in net deferred taxes, which was related to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio.    
    
  Liabilities 
  Deposit Accounts     The balances, weighted average rates and increases and decreases in deposit accounts were as follows at the dates indicated below: 

Included in the certificate accounts above were $38.3 million and $42.5 million in brokered deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.09% and 0.94%, respectively.

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Advances From FHLB     FHLB advances are summarized by contractual year of maturity and weighted average interest rate in the table below: 

Advances are secured by a blanket collateral agreement with the FHLB pledging the Bank s portfolio of residential first mortgage loans and investment securities with an amortized cost and fair value of $69.6 million and $67.5 million at   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and $77.8 million and $74.7 million at   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   Advances are subject to prepayment penalties. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Bank prepaid three FHLB advances totaling $17.9 million and incurred $789,000 in prepayment penalties in order to reduce interest expense in future periods and improve net interest spread.   
  There were no callable FHLB advances at   September 30, 2016  . Callable advances are callable at the option of the FHLB.  If an advance is called, the Bank has the option to pay off the advance without penalty, re-borrow funds on different terms, or convert the advance to a three-month floating rate advance tied to LIBOR. 
  Other Borrowings     The Bank had   $12.6 million   in other borrowings (non-FHLB advances) at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $6.2 million   or   96.5%   from   $6.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  These borrowings consist of short-term repurchase agreements with certain commercial demand deposit customers for sweep accounts.  The repurchase agreements typically mature within one to three days and the interest rate paid on these borrowings floats monthly with money market type rates. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the interest rate paid on the repurchase agreements was 0.15%.  The Bank had pledged as collateral for these repurchase agreements investment and mortgage-backed securities with amortized costs and fair values of $18.6 million and $19.0 million, respectively, at   September 30, 2016   and $14.3 million and $14.6 million, respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Junior Subordinated Debentures     On September 21, 2006, Security Federal Statutory Trust (the Trust),  issued and sold fixed and floating rate capital securities of the Trust (the  Capital Securities ). The Trust used the net proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures (the  Debentures ) of the Company which are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as junior subordinated debentures.  The Capital Securities accrue and pay distributions at a floating rate of three month LIBOR plus 170 basis points annually which was equal to 2.55% at   September 30, 2016  .  The distribution rate payable on the Capital Securities is cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears. The Capital Securities mature or are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on December 15, 2036, or upon earlier optional redemption as provided in the indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the Capital Securities in whole or in part. 
  Convertible Debentures     Effective December 1, 2009, the Company issued $6.1 million in convertible senior debentures. The debentures will mature on December 1, 2029 and accrue interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum until maturity or earlier redemption or repayment. Interest on the debentures is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year and commenced on June 1, 2010. The debentures are convertible into the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $20 per share at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity. The debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time on or after December 1, 2019, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The debentures are unsecured general obligations of the Company ranking equal in right of payment to all of our present and future unsecured indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated. 
    
  Equity     Shareholders  equity increased   $6.5 million   or   7.2%   to   $97.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $91.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, comprised primarily of unrealized gains on securities available for sale, net of tax, increased   $2.5 million   or   58.0%   to   $6.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $4.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company s net income available for common shareholders was   $4.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , after payment of   $330,000   in preferred stock dividends.  The Board of Directors of the Company declared common stock dividends totaling   $707,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Book value per common share was $25.62 at   September 30, 2016   compared to $23.41 at   December 31, 2015  .

The increase in earnings was primarily the result of increases in net interest income and non-interest income offset by an increase in non-interest expense.   
  Net Interest Income -   The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased 19 basis points to 3.46% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from 3.27% for the comparable period in   2015   as the average yield earned on interest-earning assets increased to 3.89% and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined to 0.49%. Net interest income increased   $441,000   or   7.5%   to   $6.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , average interest earning assets increased $10.2 million or 1.4% to   $755.4 million   from   $745.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .

  Interest Income -   Total tax equivalent interest income increased   $247,000   or 3.5% to $7.3 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $7.1 million during the same period in   2015  . This increase was the result of an eight basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. Total interest income on loans increased   $391,000   or   8.6%   to   $4.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.5 million   during the comparable period in   2015  .  The increase was the result of a $28.7 million or 9.0% increase in the average loan portfolio balance to $347.7 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   offset by a decrease of two basis points in the yield.      Interest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased   $67,000   or   5.3%   to   $1.2 million   from   $1.3 million   during the same period in   2015   as a result of a 15 basis point decrease in the portfolio yield offset by a $2.5 million increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities. Tax equivalent interest income from investment securities decreased   $80,000   or 6.1% to $1.2 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $1.3 million during the same period in 2015 due to a $19.7 million or 9.7% decrease in the average balance of the investment securities portfolio offset by a 10 basis point increase in the yield.  
  The following table compares detailed average balances, associated yields, and the resulting changes in interest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

         (2)      Tax equivalent basis recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets and was calculated using an effective tax rate of 34%.  The tax equivalent adjustment relates to the tax exempt municipal bonds and was $183,850 and $181,592 for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       Interest Expense   - Total interest expense decreased   $196,000   or   19.6%   to   $805,000   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in total interest expense was attributable to decreases in interest rates paid offset by a $5.2 million or 0.8% increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to $652.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Interest expense on deposits decreased $37,000 or 6.7% to $519,000 during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $556,000 for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was attributable to a two basis point decrease in the cost of deposit accounts combined with a $10.2 million or 1.7% decrease in average interest-bearing deposits to $586.0 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $596.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .

Interest expense on FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased   $164,000   or   55.2%   to   $133,000   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from   $296,000   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was attributable to a 202 basis point decrease in the yield offset by a $15.4 million or 38.8% increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and other borrowed money to   $55.3 million   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from   $39.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   the Bank prepaid one FHLB advance with a balance of $5.0 million at a 3.4% rate in order to reduce interest expense in future periods and improve its net interest spread.  
    
  The following table compares detailed average balances, cost of funds, and the resulting changes in interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

(1)    Annualized 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses -   The amount of the provision is determined by management s on-going monthly analysis of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company has policies and procedures in place for evaluating and     monitoring the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and for timely identification of potential problem loans including internal and external loan reviews. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed monthly by the Asset Classification Committee and quarterly by the Board of Directors.  
    
  Management s monthly review of the adequacy of the allowance includes three main components. The first component is an analysis of loss potential in various homogeneous segments of the loan portfolio based on historical trends and the risk inherent in each loan category. Currently, management applies a four year historical loss ratio to each loan category to estimate the inherent loss in these pooled loans.  
    
  The second component of management s monthly analysis is the specific review and evaluation of significant problem credits identified through the Company s internal monitoring system. These loans are evaluated for impairment and recorded in accordance with accounting guidance. For each loan deemed impaired, management calculates a specific reserve for the amount in which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the fair value. This estimate is based on a thorough analysis of the most probable source of repayment, which is typically liquidation of the collateral underlying the loan.  
    
  The third component is an analysis of changes in qualitative factors that may affect the portfolio, including but not limited to: relevant economic trends that could impact borrowers  ability to repay, industry trends, changes in the volume and composition of the portfolio, credit concentrations, or lending policies and the experience and ability of the staff and Board of Directors. Management also reviews and incorporates certain ratios such as percentage of classified loans, average historical loan losses by loan category, delinquency percentages, and the assignment of percentage targets of reserves in each loan category when evaluating the allowance.   
    
  Once the analysis is completed, the three components are combined and compared to the allowance amount. Based on this, charges are made to the provision as needed.  
    
  The Company had net charge-offs of $284,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net recoveries of $339,000 for the same three month period in   2015  . There was   no   provision for loan losses recorded during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a negative provision of $200,000 for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The negative provision was the result of an increase in recoveries and a decrease in non-performing assets.

Non-Interest Expense    For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , non-interest expense increased   $564,000   or   11.0%   to   $5.7 million   compared to   $5.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of non-interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased   $165,000   or   5.5%   to   $3.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.0 million   for the same period last year due to general cost of living increases.  
    
  Depreciation and maintenance of equipment increased   $110,000   or   27.3%   to   $511,000   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from   $401,000   during the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily related to the most recent branch opened in Ballentine in December 2015 which added $2.6 million in depreciable fixed assets to the balance sheet.   
    
  The Company incurred a prepayment penalty of   $261,000   for prepaying one FHLB advance during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to no prepayment penalties during the same period in   2015  . The Company elected to prepay this higher rate advance in order to reduce interest expense in future periods and improve net interest spread.  
    
  Provision For Income Taxes     The provision for income taxes increased   $53,000   or   8.9%   to   $655,000   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   from   $601,000   for the same period one year ago.  Income before income taxes was   $2.4 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $2.3 million   for the same quarter in   2015  .  The Company s combined federal and state effective income tax rate for the current quarter was   26.9%   compared to   25.6%   for the same quarter one year ago.

The increase in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income offset by a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense.   
    
  Net Interest Income -   The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased 23 basis points to 3.42% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from 3.19% for the comparable period in   2015  .

This increase was primarily the result of a 12 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. Total interest income on loans increased   $698,000   or   5.1%   to   $14.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $13.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was a result of a $12.5 million or 3.8% increase in the average loan portfolio to   $339.6 million   from   $327.1 million   for the same period in   2015   combined with a seven basis point increase in the yield.

The decrease in total interest expense is attributable to decreases in interest rates paid and a $12.3 million or 1.9% decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities.  Interest expense on deposits decreased $168,000 or 9.6% to $1.6 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $1.7 million for the same period last year. The decrease was attributable to a three basis point decrease in the cost of deposit accounts combined with an $11.3 million or 1.9% decrease in average interest-bearing deposits to $592.5 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $603.8 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was concentrated in the certificate accounts, which decreased $19.3 million or 7.7% to   $230.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from $249.9 million for the same period in   2015  .  The Bank is focusing on increasing its core deposits, or deposits other than time deposits, and has been competing less aggressively for time deposits.  
    
  Interest expense on FHLB advances and other borrowings decreased   $496,000   or   46.9%   to   $561,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $1.1 million   during the same period in   2015  .

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   the Bank prepaid $17.9 million in FHLB advances  with a weighted average rate of 4.1% in order to reduce interest expense in future periods and improve net interest spread.

Non-Interest Expense     For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , non-interest expense decreased   $204,000   or   1.2%   to   $16.9 million   compared to   $16.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of non-interest expense: 

Compensation and employee benefits expenses were   $9.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of    $699,000   or   7.8%   from   $9.0 million   during the same period last year.  The increase was due to general increases in the economy combined with increases related to the addition of several new employees during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Depreciation and maintenance of equipment increased   $222,000   or   17.6%   to   $1.5 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $1.3 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily related to the most recent branch opened in Ballentine in December 2015 which added $2.6 million in depreciable fixed assets to the balance sheet.  
    
  The Company had a net gain from the operation of OREO properties of $648,000 during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to a net cost of   $268,000   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The majority of the net gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was related to the sale of one OREO property in February 2016, which resulted in a $739,000 gain that was recorded as an offset to the cost of operating OREO properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other expenses increased   $236,000   or   7.3%   to   $3.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.2 million   for the same period in the prior year.

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Liquidity Commitments, Capital Resources, and Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
    
  Liquidity     The Company actively analyzes and manages the Bank s liquidity with the objective of maintaining an adequate level of liquidity and to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to support loan growth, fund deposit withdrawals, fund operations, and satisfy other financial commitments.  See the  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  contained in Item 1   Financial Statements, herein. 
    
  The primary sources of funds are customer deposits, loan repayments, loan sales, maturing investment securities, and advances from the FHLB.  The sources of funds, together with retained earnings and equity, are used to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations.  While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage repayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.  Management believes that the Company s current liquidity position and its forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of its existing commitments. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   loan disbursements exceeded loan repayments resulting in a   $21.2 million   or   6.4%   increase in total net loans receivable.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , deposits decreased   $1.8 million   or   0.3%   and FHLB advances increased   $11.4 million   or   32.8%  .  The Bank had $214.1 million in additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB at the end of the period.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had $131.8 million of certificates of deposit maturing within one year.  Based on previous experience, the Bank anticipates a significant portion of these certificates will be renewed on maturity. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1), Tier 1 leverage-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and total risk-based capital ratios of   20.9%  ,   11.0%  ,   20.9%  , and   22.1%  , respectively. To be categorized as  well capitalized  under the prompt corrective action provisions the Bank must maintain minimum CET1, total risk based capital, Tier 1 risk based capital and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios of 6.5%, 10.0%, 8.0% and 5.0%, respectively.  
    
  The Company also exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with CET1, Tier 1 leverage-based capital, Tier 1 risk- based capital and total risk-based capital ratios of   15.9%  ,   11.1%  ,   21.2%  , and   23.5%  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Commitments     The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.  The Company s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  Since some commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  Collateral is not required to support commitments. 
    
  The following table sets forth the length of time until maturity for unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit at   September 30, 2016  .

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.  The Company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending, investment, deposit and borrowing activities.  Management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  Although the Company manages other risks such as credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business, management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.  Other types of market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price do not arise in the normal course of the Company s business activities. 
    
  The Company s     profitability is affected by fluctuations in the market interest rate.  Management s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings.  A sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the Company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate, to the same extent or on the same basis.  The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using a test that measures the impact on net interest income and net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments.  Net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.     
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's interest rate spread, defined as the average yield on interest bearing assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 3.39% and 3.35%, respectively.

SECURITY FEDERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company s senior management as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that at   September 30, 2016   the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 
    
  The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and or fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

  Item 1      Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is not engaged in any legal proceedings of a material nature at the present time.  From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business wherein it enforces its security interest in mortgage loans it has made.

  I, J. Chris Verenes, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Security Federal Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
