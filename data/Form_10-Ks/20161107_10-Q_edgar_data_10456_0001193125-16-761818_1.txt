  Baxter International Inc.  
   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  
  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION     The unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries (the company or Baxter) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2015 Annual Report).  
 In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the
interim periods. All such adjustments, unless otherwise noted herein, are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.
   Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period condensed consolidated statements to the current period presentation.  
  Separation of Baxalta Incorporated     On July 1, 2015,
Baxter completed the distribution of approximately 80.5% of the outstanding common stock of Baxalta Incorporated (Baxalta) to Baxter shareholders (the Distribution). The Distribution was made to Baxter s shareholders of record as of the close
of business on June 17, 2015 (Record Date), who received one share of Baxalta common stock for each Baxter common share held as of the Record Date. As a result of the Distribution, Baxalta became an independent public company trading under the
symbol  BXLT  on the New York Stock Exchange. On June 3, 2016, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire plc (Shire) merged with and into Baxalta, with Baxalta as the surviving company in the merger (Merger). 
 References in this report to Baxalta prior to the Merger closing date refers to Baxalta as a stand-alone public company. References in this report to
Baxalta subsequent to the Merger closing date refer to Baxalta as a subsidiary of Shire.    As a result of the separation, the condensed consolidated
statements of income, condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of cash flow and related financial information reflect Baxalta s operations, assets and liabilities, and cash flows as discontinued operations for
all periods presented. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding the separation of Baxalta.     New accounting standards   
  Recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted     In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. The
updated guidance requires all tax effects related to share-based payment be recorded in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income. Current guidance requires that tax effects of deductions in excess of share-based compensation costs
(windfall  
      6  

Table of Contents  

tax benefits) be recorded in additional paid-in capital, and tax deficiencies (shortfalls) be recorded in additional paid-in capital to the extent of previously recognized windfall tax benefits,
with the remainder recorded in income tax expense. The new guidance also requires all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, rather than the
current requirement to present windfall tax benefits as an inflow from financing activities and an outflow from operating activities. The guidance is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2017. The impact of the standard is dependent on the
timing and value of award exercises and vesting. The company has evaluated the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and determined that net income and
operating cash flow for the periods would have each increased by approximately $9 million and $36 million, respectively, if the company had adopted the new standard January 1, 2016.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet for leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. This ASU is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2019. The company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial
statements.    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting
standards for revenue recognition. ASU No. 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective
for the company beginning on January 1, 2018. The standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.     Recently adopted accounting pronouncements   
 As of January 1, 2016, the company adopted ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amended ASC 835-30, Interest -
Imputation of Interest. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. As a result of the adoption, the company
reclassified debt issuance costs of $13 million from other assets to long-term debt in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the company s consolidated statements of
earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, or cash flows.    As of January 1, 2016, the company adopted ASU No. 2015-05,
Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This guidance requires software licenses within cloud computing arrangements to be
classified as intangible assets. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-05 did not have a material impact on Baxter s financial position or results of operations.  
 As of July 1, 2016, the company adopted ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). The guidance requires that the cash payments for debt prepayment
or debt extinguishment costs be classified as cash outflows for financing activities. As a result of the adoption, in the third quarter of 2016 the company has reclassified certain debt prepayments and debt extinguishment costs from operating
to financing activities which resulted in a decrease in financing cash flows of $16 million and $124 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the company s consolidated
statements of earnings, consolidated balance sheet, comprehensive income, or shareholders  equity.     2. SEPARATION OF BAXALTA INCORPORATED
     After giving effect to the Distribution, the company retained 19.5% of the outstanding common stock, or 131,902,719 shares of Baxalta (Retained
Shares). Effective January 27, 2016, Baxter completed a debt-for-equity exchange through the transfer of 37,573,040 Retained Shares in exchange for the extinguishment of the $1.45 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness
outstanding under the company s prior U.S. dollar denominated revolving credit facility, which was terminated in connection with the closing of this exchange. On March 16, 2016, the company completed a debt-for-equity exchange, in which Baxter
exchanged 63,823,582 Retained Shares for the extinguishment of $2.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of Baxter indebtedness. On May 6, 2016 the company contributed 17,145,570 Retained Shares to Baxter s U.S. pension fund. On May
26, 2016 the company completed an equity-for-equity exchange by exchanging 13,360,527 Retained Shares for 11,526,638 shares of Baxter. The company held no shares of Baxalta as of September 30, 2016. See Note 8 for additional details
regarding these transactions.    For a portion of Baxalta s operations, the legal transfer of Baxalta s assets and liabilities did not occur with
the separation of Baxalta on July 1, 2015 due to the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in certain countries. Under the terms of the International Commercial Operations Agreement (ICOA), Baxalta
is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets until legal transfer; therefore, the net economic benefit and any cash collected by these entities are transferred to Baxalta.  
      7

  Following is a summary of the operating results of Baxalta, which have been reflected as discontinued operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The assets and liabilities have been classified as held for disposition as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Baxter has recorded a net liability of $44 million and $190 million,
respectively, for its obligation to transfer these net assets to Baxalta. In the first nine months of 2016, the company transferred $156 million of net assets to Baxalta resulting in a gain of $17 million, which is recorded within income from
discontinued operations, net of tax. It is expected that the majority of the remaining operations will be transferred to Baxalta during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 Baxter and Baxalta entered into several agreements in connection with the July 1, 2015 separation, including a transition services agreement (TSA), separation
and distribution agreement, manufacturing and supply agreements (MSA), tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a long-term services agreement, and a shareholder s and registration rights agreement.  
 Pursuant to the TSA, Baxter and Baxalta and their respective subsidiaries are providing to each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various
services. Services being provided by Baxter include, among others, finance, information technology, human resources, quality supply chain, and certain other administrative services. The services generally commenced on the Distribution date
and are expected to terminate within 24 months (or 36 months in the case of certain information technology services) of the Distribution date. Billings by Baxter under the TSA are recorded as a reduction of the costs to provide the respective
service in the applicable expense category, primarily in marketing and administrative expenses, in the condensed consolidated statements of income. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company recognized approximately $26
million and $79 million, respectively, as a reduction in marketing and administrative expenses related to the TSA. Pursuant to the MSA, Baxalta or Baxter, as the case may be, manufactures, labels, and packages products for the other party. The
terms of the agreements range in initial duration from five to ten years. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Baxter recognized approximately $6 million and $31 million, respectively, in sales to Baxalta. In addition,
Baxter recognized $6 million and $30 million, respectively, in cost of sales related to purchases from Baxalta pursuant to the MSA. The cash flows associated with these agreements are included in cash flows from operations   continuing
operations.

  Cash inflows of $3 million were reported in cash flows from operations   discontinued operations for the
period ending September 30, 2016. These relate to non-assignable tenders whereby Baxter remains the seller of Baxalta products, transactions related to importation services Baxter provides in certain countries, in addition to trade payables settled
by Baxter on Baxalta s behalf after the local separation.      3. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    4. EARNINGS PER SHARE    
 The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) is either net income, income from continuing operations, or income from discontinued
operations. The denominator for basic EPS is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) is reflected
in the denominator for diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.    The following is a reconciliation of basic shares to diluted shares.  
   
   The effect of dilutive securities included unexercised stock options, unvested RSUs and contingently issuable shares related
to granted PSUs. The computation of diluted EPS excluded 0.3 million and 10 million equity awards for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 18 million and 16 million equity awards for the third quarter
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted EPS. Refer to Note 9 for additional information regarding items impacting basic shares.  
  Stock repurchases     In July 2012, the Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the company s common stock. In the third quarter of 2016, the company repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares pursuant to this authority and has $0.4 billion remaining available under
this authorization as of September 30, 2016.    In the second quarter of 2016, the company executed an equity-for-equity exchange of Retained Shares for
11.5 million outstanding Baxter shares. Refer to Note 8 for additional information regarding Retained Share transactions.      5. ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER
ARRANGEMENTS      In the first quarter of 2016, Baxter paid approximately $23 million to acquire the rights to vancomycin injection in 0.9% Sodium
Chloride (Normal Saline) in 500 mg, 750 mg and 1 gram presentations from Celerity Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Celerity). Baxter capitalized the purchase price as an intangible asset and is amortizing the asset over the estimated economic life of 12 years.
Refer to Note 5 within the 2015 Annual Report for additional information regarding the company s agreement with Celerity.      6. GOODWILL AND
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET       Goodwill     The
following is a reconciliation of goodwill by business segment.      
   As of September 30, 2016, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses.

Table of Contents  

   Other intangible assets, net   
 The following is a summary of the company s other intangible assets.      
   Intangible asset amortization expense was $42 million and $40 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $124 million and $120 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    In the third quarter of 2016, the
company recorded an impairment charge of $27 million related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset (acquired IPR D) in the company s Renal segment and its in-center hemodialysis program. The assets of the business were written down
to estimated fair value and recorded in research and development expenses.    In the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded an impairment charge of
$51 million, of which $41 million related to a developed technology asset, relating to the company s Hospital Products segment synthetic bone repair products business which was acquired from ApaTech Limited in 2010. The assets of the
business were written down to estimated fair value and recorded in cost of sales.    The decrease in other intangible assets, net during the first nine
months of 2016 was primarily driven by amortization expense and the impairments noted above, partially offset by the acquisition of vancomycin detailed in Note 5 and currency translation adjustments (CTA).  
   7. INFUSION PUMP AND BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION CHARGES    
  Infusion pump charges     In the first quarter of 2016, the
company refined its estimates for remediation activities related to the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump recall and decreased the reserve by $12 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company recorded utilization of
the SIGMA SPECTRUM reserve of zero and $24 million, respectively. The balance as of September 30, 2016 was $4 million for the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump recall. Refer to the 2015 Annual Report for further information about the company s
infusion pump recall activities.     Business optimization charges   
 The company records charges from its business optimization initiatives primarily related to optimizing the company s overall cost structure on a global
basis, as the company streamlines its operations, rationalizes its manufacturing facilities, enhances its general and administrative infrastructure and realigns certain research and development (R D) activities.  
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the company recorded the following charges related to business optimization programs.

costs of $101 million which primarily consisted of a global workforce reduction program and $27 million related to the impairment of acquired IPR D as described in Note 6. The restructuring charges for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 also include $54 million for costs associated with the discontinuance of the VIVIA home hemodialysis development program. These costs consisted of contract termination costs of $21 million, asset impairments of $31 million, and other exit
costs of $2 million.    For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the company recorded the following components of
restructuring costs:     
     
   Costs to implement business optimization programs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $25 million and
$44 million, respectively. These costs consisted primarily of external consulting and employee salary and related costs. The costs were included within marketing and administrative and R D expense.  
 Costs related to the integration of Gambro were included within marketing and administrative expense for all referenced periods.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company recognized accelerated depreciation, primarily associated with facilities to be closed of
$11 million and $25 million, respectively. The costs were recorded in cost of sales for all referenced periods.

Baxter paid approximately $1 billion, including accrued and unpaid interest and tender premium, to redeem such notes. As a result of the debt redemptions, the company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2016 of
approximately $52 million, which is included in other expense (income), net.     Debt-for-equity exchanges   
 On January 27, 2016, Baxter exchanged Retained Shares for the extinguishment of $1.45 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under its $1.8 billion
U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility. This exchange extinguished the indebtedness under the facility, which was terminated in connection with such debt-for-equity exchange. There were no material prepayment penalties or breakage
costs associated with the termination of the facility. Baxter recognized a net realized gain of $1.25 billion related to the Retained Shares exchanged, which was included in other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 On March 16, 2016, the company exchanged Retained Shares for the extinguishment of approximately $2.2 billion in principal amount of its 0.950% Notes due May
2016, 5.900% Notes due August 2016, 1.850% Notes due January 2017, 5.375% Notes due May 2018, 1.850% Notes due June 2018, 4.500% Notes due August 2019, and 4.250% Notes due February 2020 purchased by certain third party purchasers in the previously
announced debt tender offers. As a result, the company recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $101 million and a net realized gain of $2.0 billion on the Retained Shares exchanged, which are included in other income, net for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     Debt Maturities   
 In the second quarter of 2016, the company repaid the $190 million outstanding balance of its 0.95% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016. In the
third quarter of 2016, the company repaid the $130 million outstanding balance of its 5.9% senior unsecured notes that matured in September 2016.  
  Commercial paper     During the first nine months of 2016,
the company issued and redeemed commercial paper, of which zero was outstanding as of September 30, 2016. There was a balance of $300 million outstanding at December 31, 2015 with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.6%. This commercial
paper is classified as short-term debt.

   Securitization arrangement   
 The following is a summary of the activity relating to the company s securitization arrangement in Japan.  
   
   The impacts on the condensed consolidated statements of income relating to the sale of receivables were immaterial for each
period. Refer to the 2015 Annual Report for further information regarding the company s securitization arrangement.     Concentrations of credit risk
    The company invests excess cash in certificates of deposit or money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash among different financial
institutions. With respect to financial instruments, where appropriate, the company has diversified its selection of counterparties, and has arranged collateralization and master-netting agreements to minimize the risk of loss.  
 The company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that have experienced a
deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of September 30, 2016, the company s net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $181 million.  
 Global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and
credit losses. Governmental actions and customer-specific factors may also require the company to re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur additional credit losses. These conditions may also impact
the stability of the Euro.     Derivatives and hedging activities   
 The company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
foreign exchange and interest rates. The company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.  
 The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets
denominated in the Euro, British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Colombian Peso, Brazilian Real, Swedish Krona, Mexican Peso, and New Zealand Dollar. The company manages its foreign currency
exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange.
Gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and equity volatility resulting from foreign exchange. Financial market and currency volatility may limit the company s
ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.    The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted
by fluctuations in interest rates. The company s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the company believes is appropriate.  
 To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount.    The company does not
hold any instruments for trading purposes and none of the company s outstanding derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.  
 All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are classified as
short-term or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. Based upon the exposure being hedged, the company designates its hedging instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges.  
      14  

Table of Contents  

   Cash Flow Hedges   
 The company may use options, including collars and purchased options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating
to forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.    For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge,
the gain or loss on the derivative is accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. Option premiums or net premiums paid are initially recorded as assets and
reclassified to other comprehensive income (OCI) over the life of the option, and then recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flow hedges are classified in net sales, cost of sales, and net interest expense, and
primarily relate to forecasted third-party sales denominated in foreign currencies, forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign currencies, and anticipated issuances of debt, respectively.  
 The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts were $438 million and $378 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There
were no outstanding interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions as of
September 30, 2016 is 15 months.     Fair Value Hedges   
 The company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. These instruments hedge the company s earnings
from changes in the fair value of debt due to fluctuations in the designated benchmark interest rate. For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately
to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item. Fair value hedges are classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain of the company s fixed-rate debt.  
 The total notional amount of interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges was $200 million and $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease is due to swaps terminated in conjunction with the previously mentioned debt-for-equity exchanges and debt redemptions.  
  Dedesignations     If it is determined that a derivative or
nonderivative hedging instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If the company removes the cash flow hedge designation because the hedged forecasted transactions are no longer
probable of occurring, any gains or losses are immediately reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Gains or losses relating to terminations of effective cash flow hedges in which the forecasted transactions are still probable of occurring are deferred
and recognized consistent with the loss or income recognition of the underlying hedged items.    There were no hedge dedesignations in the first nine months
of 2016 or 2015 resulting from changes in the company s assessment of the probability that the hedged forecasted transactions would occur.    If the
company terminates a fair value hedge, an amount equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged items at the date of termination is amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the hedged item. In March 2016, the company terminated
a total notional value of $765 million of interest rate contracts in connection with the March debt tender offers, resulting in a $34 million reduction to the debt extinguishment loss. In September 2016, the company terminated a total notional value
of $335 million of interest rate contracts in connection with the September debt redemptions, resulting in a $14 million reduction to the debt extinguishment loss. The company terminated a total notional value of $1.65 billion of interest rate
contracts in connection with debt tender offers, which resulted in a $33 million reduction to the debt extinguishment loss, during the first nine months of 2015.  
  Undesignated Derivative Instruments     The company uses
forward contracts to hedge earnings from the effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of the company s intercompany and third-party receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative instruments are generally
not formally designated as hedges, and the change in fair value, which substantially offsets the change in book value of the hedged items, is recorded directly to other expense (income), net. The terms of these instruments generally do not exceed
one month.    The total notional amount of undesignated derivative instruments was $914 million as of September 30, 2016 and $580 million as of
December 31, 2015.

   For the company s fair value hedges, equal and offsetting gain of $7 million and loss of $19 million were recognized in
net interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and equal and offsetting gains of $11 million and $24 million were recognized in net interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015,
respectively, as adjustments to the underlying hedged item, fixed-rate debt. Ineffectiveness related to the company s cash flow and fair value hedges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was not material.  
 As of September 30, 2016, $3 million of deferred, net after-tax losses on derivative instruments included in AOCI are expected to be recognized in earnings
during the next 12 months, coinciding with when the hedged items are expected to impact earnings.

   Fair value measurements   
 The following tables summarize the basis used to measure financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets.      
   As of September 30, 2016, cash and equivalents of $2.6 billion included money market funds of approximately $785 million, and
as of December 31, 2015, cash and equivalents of $2.2 billion included money market funds of approximately $500 million. Money market funds would be considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
 For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units
held, without consideration of transaction costs. The investment in the Retained Shares of $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 was categorized as a Level 2 security as these securities were not registered as of that date. The value of
this investment was based on Baxalta s common stock price as of December 31, 2015, which represents an identical equity instrument registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The majority of the derivatives entered into by the
company are valued using internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes models. The key inputs are considered
observable and vary depending on the type of derivative, and include contractual terms, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility.  
 Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of commercial milestone payments and sales-based payments, and are valued using discounted cash flow
techniques. The fair value of commercial milestone payments reflects management s expectations of probability of payment, and increase as the probability of payment increases or expectation of timing of payments is accelerated. The fair value
of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates, and increases as revenue estimates increase, probability weighting of higher revenue scenarios increase or expectation of timing of payment is accelerated. Changes
in the fair value of contingent payments related to Baxter s acquisitions, which use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in the fair value measurement, were immaterial during the nine months of 2016. The company made minor sales-based
payments in the first nine months of 2016.

  The following table provides information relating to the company s investments in available-for-sale equity
securities.      
   In the first nine months of 2016 the company recorded net $4.4 billion of realized gains within other income, net related to
exchanges of available-for-sale equity securities, which represented gains from the Retained Shares transactions. On May 6, 2016, Baxter made a voluntary non-cash contribution of 17,145,570 Retained Shares to the company s U.S. pension fund.
The company recorded $611 million of realized gains within other income, net related to the contribution of Retained Shares. On May 26, 2016, Baxter completed an exchange of 13,360,527 Retained Shares for 11,526,638 outstanding shares of Baxter
common stock. The company recorded $537 million of realized gains within other income, net related to the exchange of the Retained Shares. The company held no shares of Baxalta as of September 30, 2016. Refer to the debt-for-equity
exchange section above for discussion related to the first quarter 2016 Retained Shares transactions. In the first nine months of 2015 the company recorded $38 million of income in other expense (income), net related to sales of
available-for-sale equity securities and equity method investments, which primarily represented gains from the sale of certain investments as well as distributions from funds that sold portfolio companies.  
  Book Values and Fair Values of Financial Instruments     In
addition to the financial instruments that the company is required to recognize at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the company has certain financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost or some basis other than
fair value. For these financial instruments, the following table provides the values recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the approximate fair values as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
   
   The following tables summarize the basis used to measure the approximate fair value of the financial instruments as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.      
 
      19  

Table of Contents  

Investments in 2016 and 2015 included certain cost method investments and held-to-maturity debt securities.  
 The fair value of held-to-maturity debt securities is calculated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates observable inputs, including interest
rate yields, which represents a Level 2 basis of fair value measurement.    In determining the fair value of cost method investments, the company takes into
consideration recent transactions, as well as the financial information of the investee, which represents a Level 3 basis of fair value measurement.    The
estimated fair values of current and long-term debt were computed by multiplying price by the notional amount of the respective debt instrument. Price is calculated using the stated terms of the respective debt instrument and yield curves
commensurate with the company s credit risk. The carrying values of the other financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of most of these assets and liabilities.  
   9. STOCK COMPENSATION      Stock compensation expense
totaled $30 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $84 million and $96 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Over 70% of stock compensation expense is classified in marketing
and administrative expenses with the remainder classified in cost of sales and R D expenses.    In March 2016, the company awarded its annual stock
compensation grants, which consisted of 6.4 million stock options, 1.0 million RSUs and 0.3 million PSUs.

  Refer to Note 8 for additional information regarding hedging activity and Note 10 for additional information
regarding the amortization of pension and other employee benefits items.      12. INCOME TAXES    
  Effective tax rate     The company s effective income
tax rate for continuing operations was 0.8% and 106.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and (1.1%) and 5.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The company s effective
income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the
effective tax rate can be impacted each period by discrete factors and events.    The effective income tax rate for continuing operations during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased due to restructuring and other charges incurred in higher tax rate jurisdictions as well as the favorable impact of discrete items including the partial settlement of an on-going income tax matter related to
the company s Turkish operations and the settlement of a transfer pricing audit related to the company s Italian operations. Partially offsetting the foregoing items were tax charges related to the settlement of state income tax audit
matters. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2015 was primarily the result of charges associated with the company s spin-off of Baxalta, such as debt tender premium costs associated with debt
refinancing, which received tax benefits at rates significantly higher than the rate of tax without such charges. The resulting tax benefits were greater than the resulting net loss for the period. 
 In addition to the foregoing factors, the income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 benefited by several factors including tax-free net
realized gains during the first and second quarter associated with the exchanges of Baxalta retained shares for the company s debt and the company s shares as well as tax-free net realized gains associated with the contribution of Baxalta
retained shares to the company s pension plan. Additionally, the income tax rate for this period was favorably impacted by tax benefits from partially settling an IRS (2008-2013) income tax audit and settling a German (2008-2011) income tax
audit.   During the first quarter of 2016, Baxter paid approximately $303 million to partially settle a US Federal income tax audit for the period
2008-2013. Additionally, the company settled a German income tax audit for the period 2008-2011. As a result, the company reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $85 million. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement with Baxalta,
Baxalta paid the company approximately $34 million related to its tax indemnity obligations in respect of its portion of the settled gross unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 2 for additional details regarding the separation of Baxalta.  
   13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS      Baxter is involved in
product liability, patent, commercial, and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of the company s business. The company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the
reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is
recorded. As of September 30, 2016, the company s total recorded reserves with respect to legal matters were $50 million and the total related receivables were $10 million.  
 Baxter has established reserves for certain of the matters discussed below. The company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain
contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. While the liability of the company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of
these matters could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated
financial position. While the company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims.
   In addition to the matters described below, the company remains subject to the risk of future administrative and legal actions. With respect to
governmental and regulatory matters, these actions may lead to product recalls, injunctions, and other restrictions on the company s operations and monetary sanctions, including significant civil or criminal penalties. With respect to
intellectual property, the company may be exposed to significant litigation concerning the scope of the company s and others  rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which

   General litigation   
 On July 31, 2015, Davita Healthcare Partners, Inc. filed suit against Baxter Healthcare Corporation in the District Court of the State of Colorado regarding an
ongoing commercial dispute relating to the provision of peritoneal dialysis products. The company denies the claims and is vigorously defending itself against the suit. A bench trial concluded in third quarter 2016 and the parties are awaiting
the court s decision.    In November 2016 a purported antitrust class action complaint seeking monetary and injunctive relief from the company was
filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges a conspiracy among manufacturers of IV solutions to restrict output and affect pricing in connection with a shortage of such solutions.  
  Other     In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company
received two investigative demands from the United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina for information regarding its quality and manufacturing practices and procedures and related potential violation of the Food Drug and
Cosmetic Act associated with operations at its North Cove facility. The company is fully cooperating with this investigation.      14. SEGMENT
INFORMATION      Baxter s two segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately because each business develops, manufactures and
markets distinct products and services. The segments and a description of their products and services are as follows:    The  Renal  business
provides products and services to treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure, along with other renal therapies. The Renal business offers a comprehensive portfolio to meet the needs of patients across the treatment continuum,
including technologies and therapies for peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD), continuous renal replacement therapy and additional dialysis services.  
 The  Hospital Products  business manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution systems,
oncology injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, inhalation anesthetics, and biosurgery products. The business also provides products and services related to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies.  
 The company uses income from continuing operations before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense (Segment EBITDA), on
a segment basis to make resource allocation decisions and assess the ongoing performance of the company s business segments. Intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation.  
 Certain items are maintained at Corporate and are not allocated to a segment. They primarily include most of the company s debt and cash and equivalents
and related net interest expense, foreign exchange fluctuations (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and loans denominated in a foreign currency) and the majority of the foreign currency hedging activities, corporate
headquarters costs, stock compensation expense, nonstrategic investments and related income and expense, certain employee benefit plan costs as well as certain nonrecurring gains, losses, and other charges (such as business optimization, integration
and separation-related costs, and asset impairment). Financial information for the company s segments is as follows.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      Refer to the
company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2015 Annual Report) for management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company. The following is
management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Separation of Baxalta Incorporated     On July 1, 2015,
Baxter completed the distribution of approximately 80.5% of the outstanding common stock of its biopharmaceuticals business, Baxalta Incorporated (Baxalta), to Baxter shareholders (the Distribution). As a result of the separation, the operating
results of Baxalta have been reflected as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding the separation of Baxalta. Unless otherwise stated, financial results herein reflect continuing operations.  
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Baxter s income from
continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $127 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, and $4.7 billion, or $8.56 per diluted share. This compares to $2 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, and $210 million,
or $0.38 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included special items which reduced income from continuing operations by $184
million, or $0.33 per diluted share. Special items increased income from continuing operations by $4 billion, or $7.17 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Income from continuing operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 included special items which reduced income from continuing operations by $223 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, and $309 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, respectively.

   Special Items   
 The following table provides a summary of the company s special items and the related impact by line item on the company s results of continuing
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
   Intangible asset amortization expense is identified as a special item to facilitate an evaluation of current and past
operating performance and is similar to how management internally assesses performance. Additional special items are identified above because they are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may substantially impact the
company s reported operations for a period. Management believes that providing the separate impact of the above items on the company s results in accordance with GAAP in the United States may provide a more complete understanding of
the company s operations and can facilitate a fuller analysis of the company s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. This information should be considered in addition to, and not as a
substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

   NET SALES       
   Foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by one percentage point and three percentage points during the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016, respectively. During the first nine months of 2016, foreign currency was principally impacted by the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to the Mexican Peso, Colombian Peso, British Pound, Australian Dollar,
as well as certain other currencies.    The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior
period s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period. The company believes that the non-GAAP
measure of change in net sales at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net sales at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company s operations and can facilitate
a fuller analysis of the company s results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.     Franchise Net Sales
Reporting     The Renal segment includes sales of the company s peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD) and continuous renal replacement
therapies.    The Hospital Products segment includes four commercial franchises: Fluid Systems, Integrated Pharmacy Solutions, Surgical Care and Other.  

Fluid Systems  includes sales of the company s intravenous (IV) therapies, infusion pumps and administration sets.        

Integrated Pharmacy Solutions  includes sales of the company s premixed and oncology drug platforms, nutrition products and pharmacy compounding services.    

Surgical Care  includes sales of the company s inhaled anesthesia products as well as biological products and medical devices used in surgical procedures for hemostasis, tissue sealing and adhesion
prevention.        

Other  includes sales primarily from the company s pharmaceutical partnering business.    
      29  

Table of Contents  

  The following is a summary of net sales by commercial franchise.  
   
   Net sales in the Renal segment increased 4% and 1% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. These
amounts include an unfavorable foreign currency impact of two percentage points and four percentage points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 6% and 5%
during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. This growth was driven by continued global growth of patients, new product launches, and improved pricing in the United States in our PD business. PD growth contributed
approximately four and two percentage points to the growth rate during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. In addition, global growth of the company s continuous renal replacement therapy to treat acute kidney injury
contributed one and two percentage points to the growth rate during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively.    Net sales in the
Hospital Products segment increased 2% and 3% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. These amounts include an unfavorable foreign currency impact of one percentage point and two percentage points in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 3% and 5% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. The principal drivers impacting net sales were the following:

In the Fluid Systems franchise, sales increased 11% in the third quarter and 12% in the first nine months of 2016 on a constant currency basis driven by favorable pricing and demand for IV solutions and increased sales
of the SIGMA SPECTRUM pump and the related sets in the United States.       

In the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise, sales declined 4% in the third quarter and increased 1% in the first nine months of 2016 on a constant currency basis. These changes were driven by global demand for the
company s nutritional therapies, contributing approximately two percentage points during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 and demand for the company s international hospital pharmacy compounding services which contributed
one and two percentage points during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. These increases were offset by lower U.S. sales of the company s pharmacy injectable products, as there were government PROTOPAM orders in
the first and third quarters of 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, contributing approximately one percentage point of decline. In addition, U.S. cyclophosphamide sales were approximately $163 million and $208 million in the first nine months of 2016
and 2015, respectively, which contributed approximately one percentage point of decline for the first nine months of 2016. The company expects additional competitors will enter the market.    

In the Surgical Care franchise, sales remained flat at 0% and increased 1% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, on a constant currency basis driven by increased global Biosurgery products
which contributed approximately two and one percentage point during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. Demand for international anesthesia products contributed to the approximately two percentage point decline and
one percentage point increase during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, due to certain higher than anticipated government austerity measures in Europe and the timing of certain shipments internationally.

In the Other franchise, sales increased 15% and declined 1% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, on a constant currency basis driven by lower demand for products manufactured by Baxter on
behalf of one of its pharmaceutical partners. This decline was offset by increased customer demand for products produced in our cytotoxic manufacturing facility in Germany. The company also recognized $6 million and $31 million in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016, respectively, as compared to $15 million and $24 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively, related to the company s manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxalta.

   Gross Margin and Expense Ratios       

    Gross Margin     The special
items identified above had an unfavorable impact of approximately 3.0 and 3.7 percentage points on the gross margin ratio in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. The unfavorable impact was 2.2 and 1.8 percentage points
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional detail.    Excluding the impact of
the special items, the gross margin ratio increased 1.1% and 0.2% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. The gross margin ratio was impacted by a positive sales mix, improved pricing in select areas of the portfolio,
favorable manufacturing variances in the quarter, and reduced sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide.     Marketing and Administrative Expenses   
 The special items identified above had an unfavorable impact of approximately 4.5 and 2.4 percentage points on the marketing and administrative expense ratio
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. The unfavorable impact was 5.0 and 2.8 percentage points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015. Refer to the Special Items caption above for additional detail.  
 Excluding the impact of the special items, the marketing and administrative expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 declined by
approximately $13 million and $43 million, respectively, as a result of reduced pension expense, as well as benefits from the company s actions taken to rebase its cost structure and continued focus on expense management. In addition, in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2016 the company recognized $26 million and $79 million, respectively, as a reduction to expense under the transition services agreement with Baxalta as compared to $29 million and $45 million in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively.     Research and Development   
   
   Research and development expenses increased by 7% and 11% during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016,
respectively, as a result of the special items identified above. Excluding the impact of the special items, research and development expenses decreased 8% and 4% and during the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively,
primarily due to the optimization of the R D infrastructure, the exit of certain R D programs, and the impact of foreign currency.     Business
Optimization Items     The company has implemented certain restructuring initiatives in an effort to optimize the company s overall cost structure on
a global basis, as it streamlines its operations, rationalizes its manufacturing facilities, enhances its general and administrative infrastructure, and re-aligns certain R D activities.  
 Through the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company recorded gross restructuring charges of $251 million primarily relating to a global workforce
reduction initiative, the impairment of an acquired IPR D intangible asset, and the discontinuation of the VIVIA home hemodialysis development program. Of the $251 million total restructuring charges, the company recorded gross employee
termination costs of $106 million in the third quarter of 2016 which relates to global workforce reductions. These actions are expected to provide future annual savings of $0.12 per diluted share when the program is fully implemented by the end of
2017. Refer to Note 7 within Item 1 for additional information regarding the company s business optimization initiatives.

   Net Interest Expense   
 Net interest expense was $14 million and $53 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and $34 million and $94 million in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively. The decrease in the first nine months of 2016 was driven by lower outstanding debt as a result of the first quarter 2016 debt-for-equity exchanges, reduced coupon rates resulting from the Q3
2016 debt issuance, partially offset by lower capitalized interest compared to the same period last year. See Note 8 within Item 1 for additional details about the debt extinguishments.  
  Other Expense (Income), Net     Other expense (income), net
was $44 million of expense and $4.3 billion of income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and $91 million expense and $46 million income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively.  
 The third quarter and first nine months of 2016 included net realized gains of $0 and $4.4 billion, respectively, on the Retained Shares transactions,
dividend income of $0 and $16 million, respectively, from the Retained Shares, and $0 million and $12 million, respectively, of income related to foreign currency fluctuations principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and
monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency. These income items were partially offset by net debt extinguishment losses of $52 million and $153 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. See Note 8 within Item 1
for additional details regarding the debt extinguishment losses and the Retained Shares transactions.    The third quarter and first nine months of 2015
included a $130 million loss on extinguishment of debt. This loss was more than offset in the first nine months by $52 million of income related to a litigation settlement in which Baxter was the beneficiary, $38 million of income related to
the sales of available-for-sale securities, and $92 million of income related to foreign currency fluctuations, principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency.  
  Segment EBITDA     The company uses income from continuing
operations before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense (Segment EBITDA), on a segment basis to make resource allocation decisions and assess the ongoing performance of the company s business
segments. Refer to Note 14 within Item 1 for a summary of financial results by segment. The following is a summary of significant factors impacting the segments  financial results.  
  Renal     Segment EBITDA was $214 million and $494 million
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and $182 million and $422 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by increased sales and lower marketing
and administrative expenses as cost savings were realized form the company s business optimization programs and continued focus on expense management. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency, incremental manufacturing and
quality costs, and higher allocated research and development costs.    Hospital Products   
 Segment EBITDA was $588 million and $1.673 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and $515 million and $1.462 billion in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively. This increase was driven by increased sales and lower marketing and administrative expenses as cost savings were realized from the company s business optimization programs and
continued focus on expense management. This growth was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.     Corporate and other   
 Certain income and expense amounts are not allocated to a segment. These amounts are detailed in the table in Note 14 within Item 1 and primarily include
net interest expense, foreign exchange fluctuations (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and loans denominated in a foreign currency) and the majority of the foreign currency hedging activities, corporate headquarters costs,
stock compensation expense, non-strategic investments and related income and expense, certain employee benefit plan costs as well as certain gains and losses and other charges (such as business optimization, integration and separation-related costs
and asset impairment).     Income Taxes     The
company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 0.8% and 106.1% in the third quarter and (1.1%) and 5.8% for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The company s effective income tax rate differs from the
U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective tax rate can be impacted
each period by discrete factors and events.  
      32  

Table of Contents  

  The effective income tax rate for continuing operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016
decreased due to restructuring and other charges incurred in higher tax rate jurisdictions as well as the favorable impact of discrete items including the partial settlement of an on-going income tax matter related to the company s Turkish
operations and the settlement of a transfer pricing audit related to the company s Italian operations. Partially offsetting the foregoing items were tax charges related to the settlement of state income tax audit matters. The effective
income tax rate for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2015 was primarily the result of charges associated with the company s spin-off of Baxalta, such as debt tender premium costs associated with debt refinancing, which received tax
benefits at rates significantly higher than the rate of tax without such charges. The resulting tax benefits were greater than the resulting net loss for the period. 
 In addition to the foregoing factors, the income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 benefited by several factors including tax-free net
realized gains during the first and second quarter associated with the exchanges of Baxalta retained shares for the company s debt and the company s shares as well as tax-free net realized gains associated with the contribution of Baxalta
retained shares to the company s pension plan. Additionally, the income tax rate for this period was favorably impacted by tax benefits from partially settling an IRS (2008-2013) income tax audit and settling a German (2008-2011) income tax
audit.   The company anticipates that the effective tax rate for continuing operations for the full-year 2016 will be approximately 20.5%, excluding the
impact of audit developments and other discrete items. Changes in the company s mix of earnings may also impact the effective tax rate and as profit improvement initiatives are implemented at different times and across different
operations, the earnings mix could shift with an impact on the effective tax rate.     Income from Continuing Operations and Earnings per Diluted Share
    Income from continuing operations was $127 million and $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4.7
billion and $210 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.23 and $0.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
$8.56 and $0.38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant factors and events contributing to these changes are discussed above.  
  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations     The following

Table of Contents  

   Cash Flows from Operations   Continuing Operations   
 Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by
the factors discussed below.     Accounts Receivable   
 Cash flows relating to accounts receivable were an inflow of $22 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to an inflow of $5 million in the prior
year period and days sales outstanding decreased to 55.0 days at September 30, 2016 from 60.3 at September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by timing of collections in certain international markets.  
  Inventories     Cash outflows relating to inventories
declined in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the prior year period. The following is a summary of inventories as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as annualized inventory turns for the first nine months of 2016
and 2015, by segment.      
   Segment inventory levels remained consistent during the first nine months of 2016. The increase in inventory turns of
0.28 from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016 related to business optimization charges and intangible asset impairments.     Other   
 The changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was a $326 million outflow in the first nine months of 2016 compared to a $14 million inflow in the
first nine months of 2015. The change was primarily driven by an increase in tax payments primarily due to a tax settlement as well as the timing of payments to suppliers. See Note 12 within Item 1 for additional details regarding the tax
settlement.    Payments related to the execution of the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump recall as well as the company s business optimization initiatives
increased from $61 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $119 million in the first nine months of 2016. Refer to Note 7 within Item 1 for further information regarding the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion pump recalls as well as the business
optimization initiatives.    Changes in other balance sheet items were inflows of $121 million and outflows of $216 million in the first nine months of 2016
and 2015, respectively, primarily driven by changes in prepaid expenses. During the first nine months of 2016, the company received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $218 million as a result of carrying back to prior tax years the
company s 2015 U.S. tax loss which arose, in significant part, from the funding of the company s defined benefit pension plan with a portion of the Baxalta retained stake.

million and $658 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The company s capital expenditures in 2016 consisted of targeted investments in projects to support production of PD and IV solutions as well as expansion
activities for dialyzers. The decline in capital expenditures is due to a reduction in spending related to ongoing projects and the completion of certain expansion activities.  
  Acquisitions and Investments     Cash outflows relating to
acquisitions and investments of $47 million in the first nine months of 2016 were driven primarily by the acquisition of the rights to vancomycin from Celerity. Cash outflows relating to acquisitions and investments of $27 million in the first nine
months of 2015 were driven primarily by the acquisition of the rights to cefazolin injection in GALAXY Container (2 g/100 mL).

   Divestitures and Other Investing Activities   
 Cash inflows from divestitures and other investing activities in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 were $17 million and $56 million, respectively. The
decrease was primarily due to the sales of certain investments in the first nine months of 2015.     Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
  Debt Issuances, Net of Payments of Obligations     Net cash
outflows related to debt and other financing obligations totaled $58 million for the first nine months of 2016 primarily related to a $190 million repayment of the company s 0.95% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016, a $130 million
repayment of the company s 5.9% senior unsecured notes that matured in September 2016, and the redemption of approximately $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in September 2016, as well as other short-term obligations. The
company also had $300 million of net repayments related to its commercial paper program. This was partially offset by issuances of debt totaling $1.6 billion of senior notes in August 2016. See Note 8 within Item 1 for additional details regarding
the debt transactions in the first nine months of 2016.    Cash inflows related to issuances of debt totaled $6.9 billion for the first nine months of 2015
primarily related to the Baxalta senior    notes and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities. The company purchased an aggregate of
approximately $2.7 billion in principal amount of its notes through two debt tender offers that closed in July 2015. Additionally, the company repaid $600 million of 4.625% senior unsecured notes that matured in March 2015 as well as the borrowings
under the company s Euro-denominated revolving credit facility. The company also had $450 million of net repayments related to its commercial paper program.  
  Other Financing Activities     Cash dividend payments
totaled $197 million and $847 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in cash dividend payments was primarily due to a decrease in the quarterly dividend rate of approximately 75% to $0.13 per share, as
announced in July 2016.   Proceeds and realized excess tax benefits from stock issued under employee benefit plans increased from $174 million in the
first nine months of 2015 to $286 million in the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to increased option exercises in the first nine months of 2016.  
 In the first nine months of 2016, the company executed an equity-for-equity exchange of Retained Shares for 11.5 million outstanding Baxter shares. As
authorized by the Board of Directors, the company repurchases its stock depending upon the company s cash flows, net debt level and market conditions. In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of
the company s common stock. In the third quarter of 2016, the company repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares pursuant to this authority and had $0.4 billion remaining available under this authorization as of September 30, 2016. The
company did not repurchase stock in the first nine months of 2015.    Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings   
  Credit Facilities     As of September 30, 2016, the
company s U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and Euro-denominated senior revolving credit facility had a maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and approximately $200 million Euro, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the company
was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements. The non-performance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution s
respective commitment.     Access to Capital     The
company intends to fund short-term and long-term obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt. The company had $2.6 billion of cash and equivalents as of September 30, 2016, with
adequate cash available to meet operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company operates. The company invests its excess cash in certificates of deposit and money market funds, and diversifies the concentration of cash among
different financial institutions.    The company s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into other financing
arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company s products or in the solvency of its  
      35  

Table of Contents  

customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions. However, the company believes it has
sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company s growth objectives.  
 The company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, which have experienced a
deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of September 30, 2016, the company s net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $181 million.  
 While these economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company s ability to collect receivables, global economic conditions and liquidity
issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses.     Credit Ratings
    The company s credit ratings at September 30, 2016 were as follows:     

Standard   Poor s 

Fitch

     CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS    
 The table below summarizes Baxter s contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 related to long-term debt and interest expense in the following
periods to give effect to the company s debt redemptions and debt offerings.      

1    
   Interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at September 30, 2016. Projected interest
payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events. The
projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at September 30, 2016. Refer to Note 8 within Item 1 for additional information regarding the company s debt instruments and related interest rate agreements
outstanding at September 2016.        CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. A summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the company s consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Annual Report. Certain of the company s accounting
policies are considered critical, as these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant, difficult or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effects of
matters that are inherently uncertain. Such policies are summarized in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2015 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in the
company s application of its critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2016.      LEGAL CONTINGENCIES    
 Refer to Note 13 within Item 1 for a discussion of the company s legal contingencies. Upon resolution of any of these uncertainties, the company may incur
charges in excess of presently established liabilities. While the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty, and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
 
      36  

Table of Contents  

matters could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position. While the company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future incur
material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims.      CERTAIN REGULATORY MATTERS    
 In January 2014, the company received a Warning Letter from FDA primarily directed to quality systems for the company s Round Lake, Illinois, facility,
particularly in that facility s capacity as a specification developer for certain of the company s medical devices. The company received a separate Warning Letter in December 2013 that included observations related to the company s
ambulatory infuser business in Irvine, California, which previously had been subject to agency action.    In June 2013, the company received a Warning
Letter from FDA regarding operations and processes at its North Cove, North Carolina and Jayuya, Puerto Rico facilities and in November 2015 attended a Regulatory Meeting with FDA concerning the Jayuya facility. The Warning Letter addresses
observations related to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) violations at the two facilities.    In June 2010, the company received a Warning Letter
from FDA in connection with an inspection of its McGaw Park, Illinois facility, which previously supported the Renal franchise. The company s Round Lake facility now provides the related capacity for the Renal franchise. The Warning Letter
pertains to the processes by which the company analyzes and addresses product complaints through corrective and preventative action, and reports relevant information to FDA.  
 On October 9, 2014, the company had a Regulatory Meeting with FDA to discuss the Warning Letters described above. At the meeting, the company agreed to work
closely with FDA to provide regular updates on its progress to meet all requirements and resolve all matters identified in the Warning Letters described above.  
 Please see Item 1A of the 2015 Annual Report and Item 1 of Part II of this quarterly report for additional discussion of regulatory matters and how
they may impact the company.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Currency Risk   
 The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated
in the Euro, British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Columbian Peso, Brazilian Real, Swedish Krona, Mexican Peso, and New Zealand Dollar. The company manages its foreign currency exposures on a
consolidated basis, which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange. Gains
and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders  equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. Financial market and currency volatility may limit the
company s ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.    The company may use options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign
exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions
as of September 30, 2016 is 15 months. The company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third-party receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies.  
 In advance of the U.K. European Union membership referendum, the company increased the coverage level of its British Pound and Euro exposures by adding to its
derivative positions to hedge those underlying exposures over the next 18 months. As a result, we do not expect to be significantly impacted by future potential currency volatility in the near term caused by the U.K. s proposed exit from
the European Union due to the size and composition of the company s U.K. operations and the derivative strategy and positions we currently have in place.  
 As part of its risk-management program, the company performs a sensitivity analysis to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange
instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in foreign exchange rates.    A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair
value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016, while not predictive in nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, on a net-of-tax basis, the net asset
balance of $7 million would decrease by $27 million, resulting in a net liability.    The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the
foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016 by replacing the actual exchange rates at September 30, 2016 with exchange rates that are 10% weaker to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency. All other
factors are held constant. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The analysis also
disregards the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances.     Interest Rate and Other Risks   
 Refer to the caption  Interest Rate and Other Risks  in the  Financial Instrument Market Risk  section of the 2015 Annual Report. There
were no significant changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

 Controls and Procedures       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30,
2016. Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There have been no changes in Baxter s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter s internal control over financial reporting.

     Review by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 A review of the interim condensed consolidated financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 has been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company s independent registered public accounting firm. Its report on the interim condensed consolidated financial information follows. This report is not
considered a report within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore, the independent accountants  liability under Section 11 does not extend to it.

     Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter International Inc.:  
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Baxter International Inc. and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, and the
related condensed consolidated statements of income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three month and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the company s management.  
 We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  
 Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial
statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    We previously audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of cash flows
and of changes in equity for the year then ended, and in our report dated February 26, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

(a) 
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

5. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the
registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):        

(a) 
 All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; and        

(b) 
 Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
