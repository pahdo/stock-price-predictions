NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   
 Organization: 
   
 Genesis Financial, Inc. ( the Company  or  GFI ) was incorporated in Washington State on January 24, 2002 and on January 26, 2016 we moved our corporate domicile to the State of Wyoming.  The Company is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and selling real estate receivable loans and periodically providing bridge capital funding.  Loans consist of real estate loans and mortgage notes collateralized by primarily first position liens on residential and commercial real estate.  The loans collateralized by real estate are typically non-conventional either because they are originated as a result of seller financing, or the underlying property is non-conventional. 
   
 The Company invests in loans using investor funds, equity funds and funds generated from external borrowings including a line of credit facility from a related party.    
   
 The financial statements of GFI, presented in this Form 10Q are unaudited and reflect, in the opinion of Management, a fair presentation of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  All adjustments of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   
 The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year or for any other fiscal period. 
   
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
   
  Use of estimates  - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates used herein include those relating to management s estimate of fair value of loans held for sales, real estate owned, and long-term investments.  It is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from those and other estimates used in preparing these financial statements and such differences could be material. 
   
  Fair value measurements -  The following information for each class of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value is disclosed: 
   
 1. 
 the fair value measurement; 
 2. 
 the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall, segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3); 
 3. 
 for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following: 
 a. 
 total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating those gains or losses included in earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earnings  are reported in the statement of operations; 
 b. 
 the amount of these gains or losses attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets or liabilities still held at the reporting period date and a description of where those unrealized gains or losses are reported; 
 c. 
 purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements (net); and  
 d. 
 transfers into and/or out of Level 3.

Genesis Financial, Inc. 
 Notes to Financial Statements 

4. 
 the amount of the total gains or losses for the period in (3)(a) included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date and a description of where those unrealized gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations; and 
 5. 
 in annual periods only, the valuation technique(s) used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation techniques, if any, during the period. 
   
  Real estate leasehold interest    Leasehold interests in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value.   Project costs clearly associated with the development of the leasehold interest are capitalized. As portions of the leasehold interest are rented, depreciation expense is recognized over the term of the leasehold interest. Rental income received on the interests is recognized in the period earned. 
   
  Loans held for sale      Loans held for sale are initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  Loans held for sale are re-measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   Fair value for these loans is determined by assessing the probability of borrower default using historical payment performance and available cash flows to the borrower, then projecting the amount and timing of cash flows, including collateral liquidation if repayment weaknesses exist.  The Company considers any valuation inputs related to loans held for sale to be Level 3 inputs. Interest on loans held for sale is included in interest income during the period held for sale. Typically, the Company attempts to sell loans three to twelve months after acquisition. It is the policy of the Company not to hold any loans for investment purposes.   
   
  Real estate owned    Real estate owned ( REO ) (acquired through a loan default) is recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  Upon transfer of a loan held for sale to REO, properties are recorded at amounts which are equal to fair value of the properties based on the following inputs: (1) appraisal provided by a certified appraiser, (2) BPO (Broker s Pricing Opinion) provided by a qualified real estate broker, (3) site inspection by qualified management of the Company, or (4) a combination of all of the above.  Periodically, non-recurring fair value adjustments to REO are recorded to reflect partial write-downs based on the same inputs.  The Company considers any valuation inputs related to REO to be Level 3 inputs.  The individual carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and any additional impairment charges are expensed to operations. 
   
  Income tax    Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets, subject to a valuation allowance, are recognized for future benefits of net operating losses being carried forward.  The Company effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be 0%. 
   
  Earnings per share    Basic earnings per common share have been computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period presented.  Diluted earnings per common share are computed on the basis of the number of shares that are currently outstanding plus the number of shares that would be issued pursuant to outstanding warrants, stock options and common stock issuable on conversion of preferred stock unless such shares are deemed to be anti-dilutive such as when a net loss is present. The dilutive effect of convertible debt and outstanding securities, in periods of future income, would be as follows as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015; 

Reclassifications    Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior periods  data to the current presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the reported results of operations or stockholders  equity.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   
   
 When used in this Form 10-Q and in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the words or phrases will likely result, management expects, or we expect, will continue, is anticipated, estimated or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, each of which speaks only as of the date made. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are described below. Actual results may differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. We have no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements. 
   
  Background  
 Genesis Financial, Inc. is engaged in the business of buying and selling seller financed real estate loans ( loans ), and originating commercial real estate hard money loans and providing startup capital funding. We purchase loans at a discount and hold them for sale for a relatively short period to provide seasoning and value appreciation. After the holding period, we sell the loans. We expect to derive operating revenues from resales of loans at a profit, and from interest income derived from loans during the holding period. We originate commercial real estate loans and sell the loan, or participations in those loans, to accredited private investors.  From time to time, we also consider other forms of cash flow instruments when warranted.  Genesis has also invested in two private companies with a view toward diversifying its investment portfolio. 
   
 Additional details about our business are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
 The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze our financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. You should read this analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This section contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies and financial performance. The Company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors set forth under  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in this Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  PLAN OF OPERATIONS.  
   
 Over the course of the next twelve months, we will continue to concentrate on resolving delinquencies and repossession situations, raising capital to acquire income producing real estate, and make new short term bridge loans in the real estate industry.  We are not capitalized at a level that allows holding of significant amounts of loans and as a result, we will continue to work toward short term turnover.  
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  
   
  Quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
   
  Revenues  
   
 Total revenues for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 were $17,673 compared to $34,104 for the same quarter ending September 30, 2015.  The majority of the revenue for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 was from rental, interest and loan fee income. The decrease in revenue was the result of reduction rental income due to the decline in oil prices that impacted our rental property in North Dakota.  
   
 Net loss from operations was ($99,166) and ($105,482), respectively, for the quarters ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in net operating loss was due to the company reducing it regular expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

Genesis Financial, Inc. 
 Notes to Financial Statements 

Of the loans held for sale at September 30, 2016, $302,622 were in payment default.  We believe the defaults and repossessions are directly related to the national real estate market collapse. 
   
  General and Administrative Expenses  
   
 General and administrative expenses ( G A ) for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $53,282 and $51,926, respectively. G A primarily consists of management and professional fees for legal and auditing.  The changes for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,356 and $13,464, respectively.  The primary reason for the increase in 2015 was due to bad debts and public company expenses. 
   
  Interest Expense  
   
 For the quarters ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense amounted to $6,225 and $8,310, respectively. The reduction is the result of converting a note to common stock. 
   
 Interest expense was incurred on borrowings under lines of credit with Riverbank, an unaffiliated lender, and the convertible note payable with John R. Coghlan, an affiliated person, now converted and the Coghlan Family Corporation, an affiliated company. 
   
 We are currently operating under a primary $250,000 line of credit with Riverbank, an unaffiliated lender, with an interest rate 4.5%.  The line of credit also included a one-half percent origination fee.  The line of credit was extended to December 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances were $134,714 and $170,000, respectively. 
   
 We also are currently operating under a secondary $2,500,000 line of credit with Coghlan Family Corporation, an affiliated company, with an interest rate of Four (4%) percent to be issued monthly in common stock. The line of credit also includes a 50,000 commons stock per year origination fee. On August 1, 2016 interest and commitment fees were amended and 50,000 shares of common stock issued for renewal fee. On August 31, 2016, 31,233 shares were issued and on September 30, 2016, 30,192 shares were issued for monthly interest. 
   
 We consider the terms of the lines of credit to be acceptable. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances on the lines of credit were $950,000 and $1,260,000, respectively.  Interest expense on the line of credit will fluctuate in future periods with inventory levels.  
   
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   
  Revenues  
   
 Total revenues for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 were $51,054 compared to $111,999 for the same period ending September 30, 2015.  The majority of the revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was from rental, interest and loan fee income. The decrease in revenue was the result of reduction rental income due to the decline in oil prices that impacted our rental property in North Dakota.   
   
 Net loss from operations was ($459,120) and ($188,403), respectively, for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase was due to a realized loss on sale of available for sale security for $497,787 in 2016. 
   
  General and Administrative Expenses  
   
 General and administrative expenses ( G A ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $183,154 and $163,486, respectively. G A primarily consists of management and professional fees for legal and auditing.  The changes for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $19,668 and $23,922, respectively.

Genesis Financial, Inc. 
 Notes to Financial Statements 

Interest Expense  
   
 For the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expense amounted to $8,322 and $22,640, respectively. The reason for the reduction is the note being converted to stock. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  
   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash available of $15,272 and $31,301, respectively, and $115,286 and $80,000 were available under our bank line of credit. Management considers the capital resources to be adequate to meet the current operating needs of the Company for the next twelve months. 
   
 Genesis is currently operating under a primary $250,000 line of credit with Riverbank, an unaffiliated lender, with a variable interest rate equal to the prime rate index rate (as published in the Wall Street Journal) plus 1%, with a floor of four and one-half percent.  The line of credit also included a one-half percent origination fee.  The line of credit expires December 1, 2016. The line is payable on demand and is personally guaranteed by John and Wendy Coghlan. At September 30, 2016 the balance was $134,714.  
   
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had a $2,500,000 Line of Credit Agreement with the Coghlan Family Corporation, Inc. ( CFC ) with a balance of $950,000. CFC is an affiliated company controlled by a director and principal shareholder of the Company. The interest rate on the line is a variable interest rate equal to the prime rate index (as published in the Wall Street Journal) plus 1%.  The line has a term of 12 months and an origination fee of 1/2% or $12,500. The credit line is collateralized by all of Genesis  assets but is subordinate to the RiverBank line of credit. The line of credit agreement requires that the Company maintain a debt to equity ratio of no greater than 3.0. Borrowings under the line are personally guaranteed by an officer of the Company.  Because of the weak economic conditions, effective January 1, 2012, CFC had agreed to (1) extend the due date to January 1, 2016, waive all interest beginning October 1, 2010, (2) waive the 12% default rate, (3) waive the financial covenants and (4) waive the commitment fee. In February 2016 the maturity date was extended and on August 1, 2016, , the company amended the Warehouse Line of Credit Promissory Note Agreement to four (4%) percent interest to be paid monthly in common stock. In addition, the Company issued 50,000 shares of its common stock valued at $5,000 as a loan renewal fee for the three months ended September 30, 2016. (See exhibit 10) Also 61,425 shares of the company common stock were issued for a value of $6,142 in interest for the three month ended   September 30, 2016.  
   
 Our capital resources have been adequate to fund our operations at a reasonable level during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. We have paid close attention to our contract purchases and loans and maintained our funding requirements within our available resources. We receive interest and principal reductions (typically monthly) on contracts and loans which we hold in inventory.  We would require an increase in our capital base to grow the company, and become profitable. 
   
 For the quarters ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net cash flows provided by (used by) operating activities were ($373,614) and ($66,933), respectively. The reason for the decrease was the realized loss on available for sale security. 
   
 For the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the cash flows used by investing activities was $392,147 and ($32,039), respectively. The reason for the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was the sale of real estate limited liability company interest.  
   
 During these periods our net cash provided by (used by) financing activities was ($34,562) and $119,944, respectively.  The reason for the increase for the period ended September 30, 2016 were advances on the Riverbank line of credit.  
   
 The Company s principal sources of cash are from interest, loan fees, rental income, related party loans, unaffiliated party loans, funding agreements and common stock private placements. The Company anticipates that our primary uses of cash will need to be supplemented in order to meet the demands upon its current operations, and the need for additional funds to finance ongoing acquisitions of seller financed real estate receivables and originations of commercial real estate hard money loans, and the expense of the litigating of delinquent contracts and loans, and the maintenance and resale costs of repossessed properties.

 Not applicable to Smaller Reporting Companies 
           Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   
   
          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Chairman of the Board), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  
   
 Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2016 to cause the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Chairman of the Board), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the requisite evaluation that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Limitations  
   
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (Chairman of the Board), does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of

 Notes to Financial Statements 

controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
   
    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  
               Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.   
   
           Presently, we are not subject to any material legal proceedings.  In the normal course of business, the Company is the initiator of legal proceedings associated with judicial real estate foreclosures related to our loan portfolio collateral interests.
