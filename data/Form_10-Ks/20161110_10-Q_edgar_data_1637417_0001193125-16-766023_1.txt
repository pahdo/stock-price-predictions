(a)  
  Security may be an obligation of one or more entities affiliated with the named company.     

(b)  
  Certain variable rate securities in the Company s portfolio bear interest at a rate determined by a publicly disclosed base rate plus a basis point spread. As of
September 30, 2016, the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, was 0.85%.         

(c)  
  Denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.         

(d)  
  Fair value determined by the Company s board of directors (see Note 7).     

(e)  
  The investment is not a qualifying asset under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. A business development company may not acquire any asset
other than qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company s total assets. As of September 30, 2016, 96.8% of the Company s total assets represented qualifying assets.
In addition, as described in Note 8, the Company also calculates its compliance with the qualifying asset test on a  look through  basis by disregarding the value of the Company s total return swap and treating each loan underlying
the total return swap as either a qualifying asset or non-qualifying asset based on whether the obligor is an eligible portfolio company. On this basis, 82.5% of the Company s total assets represented qualifying assets as of September 30, 2016.

(g)  
  Security is non-income producing.         

(h)  
  Security is an unfunded commitment. The stated rate reflects the spread disclosed at the time of commitment and may not indicate the actual rate received upon funding.

     Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements    
   (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)        
       Note 1. Principal Business and
Organization       FS Investment Corporation IV, or the Company, was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the
State of Maryland on February 25, 2015 and formally commenced investment operations on January 6, 2016 upon raising gross proceeds in excess of $1,000, or the minimum offering requirement, from sales of shares of its Class T common
stock in its continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with the Company or the Company s investment adviser, FSIC IV Advisor, LLC, or FSIC IV Advisor. FSIC IV Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, and an affiliate of the Company. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering requirement, the Company had no operations except for matters relating to its organization.   
  The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a
business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, the Company intends to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually, as a regulated
investment company, or RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had one wholly-owned subsidiary through which it has entered into a financing arrangement,
one wholly-owned subsidiary through which it expects to hold interests in certain non-controlled portfolio companies and one wholly-owned subsidiary through which it may in the future enter into a financing arrangement. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements include both the Company s accounts and the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
  The Company s investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation by
investing primarily in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private U.S. companies. The Company seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns by focusing on debt investments in a broad array of private U.S. companies, including
middle market companies, which the Company defines as companies with annual revenues of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. The Company may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in
senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the  over-the-counter  market or directly from the Company s target companies as primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with the Company s
debt investments, the Company may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. The Company may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests, in target companies, in the form of common or
preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity. Any such minority interests are generally acquired
in conjunction with one of the Company s debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of the Company s portfolio may be comprised of
corporate bonds, collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps.       Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of
Presentation : The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions
for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion

       Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (continued)        
   
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. For a more complete discussion of significant accounting
policies and certain other information, the Company s interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2015 included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The December 31, 2015
consolidated balance sheet is derived from the Company s audited consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2015. The Company is considered an investment company under GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting guidance
applicable to investment companies under Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-08,  Financial Services     Investment Companies . The Company has evaluated the impact of subsequent events through the date the consolidated
financial statements were issued and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.       Use of
Estimates : The preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Many of the amounts have been rounded, and all amounts
are in thousands, except share and per share amounts.       Capital Gains Incentive Fee : The Company entered into an
investment advisory and administrative services agreement with FSIC IV Advisor, dated as of September 21, 2015, or the investment advisory and administrative services agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory and
administrative services agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee will equal 20.0% of the Company s incentive fee
capital gains (i.e., the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative
basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.
     While the investment advisory and administrative services agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of
unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, the Company includes
unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to FSIC IV Advisor if the Company s entire portfolio
was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though FSIC IV Advisor is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.   
  Based on an interpretation of the applicable language in the Advisers Act by the staff of the Division of Investment Management of the
SEC, the Company  looks through  its total return swap, or TRS, between its wholly-owned financing subsidiary Cheltenham Funding LLC, or Cheltenham Funding, and Citibank, N.A., or Citibank, in calculating the capital gains incentive
fee. Under this  look through  methodology, the portion of the net settlement payments received by the Company pursuant to the TRS which would have represented net

   (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)        
       Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (continued)        
   
investment income to the Company had the Company held the loans underlying the TRS directly is treated as net investment income subject to the subordinated incentive fee on income payable to FSIC
IV Advisor pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, rather than as realized capital gains in accordance with GAAP, and any unrealized depreciation on individual loans underlying the TRS further reduces the capital
gains incentive fee payable to FSIC IV Advisor with respect to realized gains. See Note 8 for a discussion of the TRS.   
   Subordinated Income Incentive Fee : Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC IV Advisor may
also be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company s  pre-incentive fee net investment
income  for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital equal to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. For purposes of this fee,
 adjusted capital  means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company s common stock (including proceeds from its distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the
Company s share repurchase program. As a result, FSIC IV Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once the
Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FSIC IV Advisor is entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate,
until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FSIC IV Advisor is entitled to receive 20.0% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net
investment income.       Organization Costs : Organization costs include, among other things, the cost of incorporating,
including the cost of legal services and other fees pertaining to the Company s organization. These costs are expensed as the Company raises proceeds in its continuous public offering. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company expensed $0 and $317, respectively, of organization costs as it raised proceeds in its continuous public offering, which commenced on January 6, 2016. During the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to December 31, 2015,
the Company incurred organization costs of $317 which were paid on the Company s behalf by Franklin Square Holdings, L.P., or FS Investments, the Company s sponsor and an affiliate of FSIC IV Advisor (see Note 4).   
   Offering Costs : Offering costs primarily include, among other things, marketing expenses and printing, legal, and due diligence
fees and other costs pertaining to the Company s continuous public offering of shares of its common stock, including the preparation of the Company s Registration Statement on Form N-2 and salaries and direct expenses of FSIC IV
Advisor s personnel, employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in such activities. The Company will defer and amortize such costs as an expense over twelve months as the Company raises proceeds in its continuous public
offering. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $286 and $517, respectively, of offering costs as it raised proceeds in its continuous public offering, which commenced on January 6, 2016. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to December 31, 2015, the Company incurred offering costs of $2,017 and $3,403, respectively, which were paid on the Company s behalf by FS
Investments (see Note 4).

    Note 3. Share Transactions    
  Below is a summary of transactions with respect to shares of the Company s common stock during the nine months ended September 30,
2016:       
     Status of Continuous Public Offering       Since commencing its continuous public offering and through November 1, 2016, the Company has issued 11,429,689 shares of Class T common stock for gross proceeds of $124,209, including Class T common
stock issued under its distribution reinvestment plan and $8,964 in gross proceeds from the principal of FSIC IV Advisor, certain members of the Company s board of directors and other individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC IV
Advisor and GSO/Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, or GDFM, the Company s investment sub-adviser. As of November 1, 2016, the Company had raised total gross proceeds of $124,409, including $200 of seed capital contributed by the principal of
FSIC IV Advisor in February 2015 (see Note 4).      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued
10,389,506 shares of Class T common stock for gross proceeds of $112,635 at an average price per share of $10.84. The gross proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include reinvested stockholder distributions of $1,469, for
which the Company issued 137,034 shares of Class T common stock. During the period from October 1, 2016 to November 1, 2016, the Company issued 1,040,183 shares of Class T common stock for gross proceeds of $11,574 at an average price per share of
$11.13.      The proceeds from the issuance of common stock as presented on the Company s unaudited consolidated statement of
changes in net assets and unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows are presented net of upfront selling commissions fees of $2,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
  The Company has submitted to the SEC an application for an exemptive order to permit it to offer additional classes of common stock. If
an exemptive order satisfactory to the Company is granted prior to January 6, 2017, a year from the date the Company met the minimum offering requirement, it intends to offer additional classes of its common stock with each class having a different
upfront sales load and fee and expense structure. If an exemptive order satisfactory to the Company is not granted prior to January 6, 2017, the Company may close the offering of Class T shares (other than shares issued under the Company s
distribution reinvestment plan) and would not issue any additional share classes. The Company is currently considering alternatives that would allow it to continue the offering after January 6, 2017.

    Share Repurchase Program       The Company intends to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to its share repurchase program. The first such tender offer commenced in May 2016, and the repurchase occurred in connection
with the Company s July 6, 2016 weekly closing. The Company s board of directors will consider the following factors, among others, in making its determination regarding whether to cause the Company to offer to repurchase shares and under
what terms:       

the effect of such repurchases on the Company s qualification as a RIC (including the consequences of any necessary asset sales);

the liquidity of the Company s assets (including fees and costs associated with disposing of assets);      

the Company s investment plans and working capital requirements;      

the relative economies of scale with respect to the Company s size;      

the Company s history in repurchasing shares of common stock or portions thereof; and      

the condition of the securities markets.         The Company currently intends to limit the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of shares of common stock it can repurchase with the proceeds it
receives from the issuance of shares of common stock under its distribution reinvestment plan. Because the Company s distribution reinvestment plan will be structured as an  opt in  program that requires stockholders to affirmatively
elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of common stock, such requirement may contribute to the illiquidity of the Company s shares of common stock. At the discretion of the Company s board of directors, the
Company may also use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings and cash from the liquidation of securities investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares of common stock. In addition, beginning with the calendar quarter
ending March 31, 2017, the Company will limit the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 2.5% in each
calendar quarter, though the actual number of shares of common stock that the Company offers to repurchase may be less in light of the limitations noted above. The Company s board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
limit the number of shares to be repurchased for each class by applying the limitations on the number of shares to be repurchased, noted above, on a per class basis. The Company intends to offer to repurchase such shares of common stock at the net
offering price in effect on each date of repurchase. The Company s board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, upon 30 days  notice.   
  If a stockholder tenders his or her shares for repurchase by the Company prior to the fifth anniversary of the date such shares were
purchased or, if such shares were purchased prior to January 6, 2017, within the period from the date of purchase to February 1, 2022, such shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge. The contingent deferred sales charge will be
calculated based upon the lesser of the estimated value of Class T shares as of the date of repurchase and the public offering price at the time such shares were purchased. The amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is payable on a declining
annual basis depending on how long the stockholder holds the Class T shares, and is measured from the date of purchase. If the Class T shares are tendered for repurchase: (i) prior to the first anniversary, the charge is 3.90%; (ii) prior to the
second anniversary, the charge is 3.12%; (iii) prior to the third anniversary, the charge is 2.34%; (iv) prior to the fourth anniversary, the charge is 1.56%; and (v) prior to the fifth anniversary, the charge is 0.78%. For shares purchased prior to

January 6, 2017, the anniversary date for the applicable year shall be measured from February 1, 2017. The contingent deferred sales charge is not payable with respect to shares issued under the
Company s distribution reinvestment plan. If a stockholder tenders a portion of his or her shares, shares received pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan will be redeemed first. After all such shares have been redeemed,
shares will be redeemed on a first-in, first-out basis.      The following table provides information concerning the
Company s repurchase of shares of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:       
    On October 5, 2016, the Company repurchased 9,217 shares of common stock
(representing 100% of the shares of common stock tendered for repurchase and 0.09% of the shares outstanding as of such date) at $10.8558 per share for aggregate consideration totaling $100. Repurchased shares that were not issued under the
Company s distribution reinvestment plan were subject to a contingent deferred sales charge as described above, which amount was paid to FS Investment Solutions, LLC (formerly FS   2    Capital Partners, LLC), or FS Investment Solutions, the dealer manager for the Company s continuous public
offering and an affiliate of the Company.       Note 4. Related Party Transactions    
   Compensation of the Investment Adviser       Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC IV Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average weekly value of the Company s gross
assets and an incentive fee based on the Company s performance. The Company commenced accruing fees under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement on January 6, 2016, upon commencement of the Company s investment
operations. Base management fees are paid on a quarterly basis in arrears.      The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first
part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company s  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately
preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, equal to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. For purposes of this fee,  adjusted capital  means cumulative
gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company s common stock (including proceeds from its distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program. As a result,
FSIC IV Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in
any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FSIC IV Advisor will be entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s  pre-incentive  fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375% of adjusted capital, or 9.375% annually. This  catch-up  feature allows FSIC IV Advisor to recoup the fees foregone as a result of
the existence of the hurdle rate. Thereafter, FSIC IV Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income.

Transactions (continued)        
   The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on
capital gains, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of the Company s incentive fee capital gains
(i.e., the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less
the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. The Company accrues for the capital gains incentive fee, which, if earned, is paid annually. The Company accrues the capital gains incentive fee based on net realized and
unrealized gains; however, under the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the fee payable to FSIC IV Advisor is based on realized gains and no such fee is payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until
such gains are actually realized. See Note 2 for a discussion of the treatment of the TRS with respect to the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee.      Pursuant to an investment sub-advisory agreement between FSIC IV and GDFM, or the sub-advisory agreement, GDFM will receive 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FSIC IV Advisor under the
investment advisory and administrative services agreement with respect to each year.      The Company reimburses FSIC IV Advisor
for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company s administration and operations, including FSIC IV Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments, the
Company s sponsor and an affiliate of FSIC IV Advisor, providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of FSIC IV Advisor. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FSIC IV Advisor s actual costs incurred
in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FSIC IV Advisor allocates the cost of such services to
the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Company s board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how expenses are allocated to the Company and the proposed
allocation of administrative expenses among the Company and certain affiliates of FSIC IV Advisor. The Company s board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to the Company based on the
breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, the Company s board of directors considers whether
any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Company s board of directors compares the total amount paid to FSIC IV Advisor for such services as a
percentage of the Company s net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. The Company does not reimburse FSIC IV Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital
equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FSIC IV Advisor.      Under the investment advisory
and administrative services agreement, the Company, either directly or through reimbursement to FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliates, is responsible for its organization and offering costs in an amount up to 0.75% of gross proceeds raised in the
Company s continuous public offering. Organization and offering costs primarily include legal, accounting, printing and other expenses relating to the Company s continuous public offering, including costs associated with technology
integration between the Company s systems and those of its selected broker-dealers, marketing expenses, salaries and direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor s personnel, employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in registering and
marketing the Company s common stock, which includes the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating the marketing process for the Company.

   Prior to satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement and for a period of time
thereafter, FS Investments, an affiliate of FSIC IV Advisor, will fund the Company s organization and offering costs. Following this period, the Company will pay its organization and offering costs directly and will reimburse FSIC IV Advisor
for offering costs incurred by FSIC IV Advisor on the Company s behalf, including marketing expenses, with respect to salaries and other direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor s personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in
registering and marketing the Company s shares of common stock. On January 6, 2016, the investment advisory and administrative services agreement became effective upon satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement, and FSIC IV Advisor
became entitled to receive up to 0.75% of the gross proceeds raised in the Company s continuous public offering until all organization and offering costs incurred have been recovered. As the Company reimburses FSIC IV Advisor for such costs,
organization costs are charged to expense and offering costs are deferred and amortized to expense over twelve months.      FS
Investments funded certain of the Company s organization and offering costs in the amounts of $2,017 and $3,720, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to
December 31, 2015. Under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, there was no liability on the Company s part for the organization or offering costs funded by FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliates (including FS
Investments) until the Company satisfied the minimum offering requirement on January 6, 2016. Since commencing its continuous public offering and through September 30, 2016, the Company has paid total reimbursements of $834 to FSIC IV Advisor
and its affiliates for organization and offering costs funded by them.      The following table describes the fees and expenses
the Company accrued under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement and pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016:

(4)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed offering costs of $517, which related to reimbursements to FSIC IV Advisor for offering costs
incurred on the Company s behalf, including marketing expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor s personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the Company s shares of
common stock.     

(5)  
  Represents the total amount of the contingent deferred sales charge paid to FS Investment Solutions by stockholders who tendered shares pursuant to the Company s
share repurchase program.         Compensation of the Dealer Manager    
  The dealer manager for the Company s continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, which is one of the Company s
affiliates. Under an amended and restated dealer manager agreement, dated as of November 11, 2015, among the Company, FSIC IV Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive upfront sales commissions in
connection with the sale of shares of common stock in the Company s continuous public offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The dealer manager re-allowed to selected
broker dealers and other financial representatives the upfront sales commissions it was entitled to receive during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      Shares of Class T common stock are subject to an annual distribution fee of 1.40% of the estimated value of such shares, as determined in accordance with applicable rules of The Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA. The distribution fee will be paid by the Company to the dealer manager pursuant to a distribution plan adopted by the Company in compliance with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the 1940 Act, as if those rules
applied to the Company. Among other requirements, such plan must be approved annually by a vote of the Company s board of directors, including the directors who are not  interested persons  as defined in the 1940 Act and have no
direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of such plan or in any agreements related to such plan.      All or a
portion of the distribution fee may be re-allowed by the dealer-manager to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives participating in the Company s continuous public offering. The amount and timing of the reallowance will be based
on such factors as the number of shares they sold in the offering, the assistance they provided in marketing the offering and due diligence expenses they incurred. The distribution fee is intended, in part, to compensate the dealer manager and its
affiliates for paying certain amounts to advisors and selected broker-dealers at the time of purchase in connection with the distribution of shares of Class T common stock as well as for services rendered by the dealer manager and selected
broker-dealers in connection with the ongoing marketing, sale and distribution of such shares.      The distribution fee will
accrue daily, beginning on February 1, 2017, and will be paid on a monthly basis. The distribution fee is payable with respect to all shares of Class T common stock, other than shares issued under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan.
The distribution fee will terminate upon the earliest of: (i) a

liquidity event; (ii) the Company s dealer manager advising the Company that the aggregate underwriting compensation from all sources (determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules),
including upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution fees and any other underwriting compensation paid to participating broker-dealers with respect to all Class T shares would be in excess of 10% of the gross proceeds from the
offering; and (iii) when the total underwriting compensation received from the upfront sales load and distribution fee attributable to Class T shares equal 8.95% of gross offering proceeds, or the sales charge cap. The sales charge cap
applicable to certain Class T shares will be reduced by the amount of any upfront selling commission that is waived for such shares.   
   Capital Contributions by FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM       In February 2015, Michael C. Forman, the principal of FSIC IV Advisor, contributed $200, which was used in its entirety to purchase 20,000 shares of Class T common stock at $10.00 per share.
Mr. Forman will not tender these shares of common stock for repurchase as long as FSIC IV Advisor remains the Company s investment adviser.      As of November 1, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 865,368 shares of Class T common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $8,964 to the principal of FSIC IV Advisor, members of the Company s
board of directors and other individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM, including shares of Class T common stock sold to Mr. Forman in February 2015.       Potential Conflicts of Interest       FSIC IV Advisor s senior management
team is comprised of substantially the same personnel as the senior management teams of FB Income Advisor, LLC, FS Investment Advisor, LLC, FSIC II Advisor, LLC, FSIC III Advisor, LLC and FS Global Advisor, LLC, the investment advisers to certain
other BDCs and a closed-end management investment company affiliated with FS Investments. As a result, such personnel provide investment advisory services to the Company and each of FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment
Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III and FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund. While none of FSIC IV Advisor, FB Income Advisor, LLC, FS Investment Advisor, LLC, FSIC II Advisor, LLC, FSIC III Advisor, LLC or FS Global Advisor, LLC is
currently making private corporate debt investments for clients other than the Company, FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III or FS Global Credit Opportunities Fund,
respectively, any, or all, may do so in the future. In the event that FSIC IV Advisor undertakes to provide investment advisory services to other clients in the future, it intends to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner
consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies, if necessary, so that the Company will not be disadvantaged in relation to any other client of FSIC IV Advisor or its management team. In addition, even in the absence of FSIC
IV Advisor retaining additional clients, it is possible that some investment opportunities may be provided to FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III and/or FS Global Credit
Opportunities Fund rather than to the Company.       Co-Investment Exemptive Relief    
  As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not
permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions
where price is the only negotiated point. In an order dated June 4,

2013, the SEC granted exemptive relief to affiliates of the Company, upon which the Company may rely, and which permits the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to
co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of FSIC IV Advisor, including FS Investment Corporation, FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III and any future
BDCs that are advised by FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers, or collectively the Company s co-investment affiliates. The Company believes this relief will enhance its ability to further its investment objectives and strategy.
The Company believes this relief may also increase favorable investment opportunities for it, in part, by allowing it to participate in larger investments, together with its co-investment affiliates, than would be available to the Company if such
relief had not been obtained. Because the Company s affiliates did not seek exemptive relief to engage in co-investment transactions with GDFM and its affiliates, the Company is permitted to co-invest with GDFM and its affiliates only in
accordance with existing regulatory guidance (e.g., where price is the only negotiated term).       Expense Reimbursement    
  Pursuant to an amended and restated expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement, dated as of October 9, 2015, by and
between FS Investments and the Company, or the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of the Company s distributions to
stockholders will be paid from its offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments the Company may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other distributions to the Company that are
treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of the Company s distributions to stockholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital to the extent that the Company may use such dividends or other distribution proceeds
to fund its distributions to stockholders. Under those circumstances, FS Investments will not reimburse the Company for the portion of such distributions to stockholders that represent a return of capital, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement
arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to stockholders.      Under the expense reimbursement agreement, FS
Investments will reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between the Company s cumulative distributions paid to its stockholders in each quarter, less the sum of the Company s net investment company taxable
income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or
net capital gains) in each quarter.      Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation
to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by FS Investments under such agreement if (and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of the
Company s net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not
included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the cumulative distributions paid by the Company to its stockholders during such quarter; provided, however, that (i) the Company will only reimburse FS Investments for
expense support payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter to the extent that the payment of such reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause  other operating
expenses  (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support payments received by the Company during such

fiscal year) to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of the Company s average net assets attributable to shares of common stock for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such payments into
account and (B) the percentage of the Company s average net assets attributable to shares of its common stock represented by  other operating expenses  during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments
was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year); and (ii) the Company will not reimburse FS Investments
for expense support payments made by FS Investments for any calendar quarter if the annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by the Company at the time of such reimbursement payment is less than the annualized rate of regular cash
distributions declared by the Company at the time FS Investments made the expense support payment to which such reimbursement payment relates. The Company is not obligated to pay interest on the reimbursements it is required to make to FS
Investments under the expense reimbursement agreement.  Other operating expenses  means the Company s total  operating expenses  (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, distribution fees,
organization and offering costs, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses.  Operating expenses  means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with GAAP for
investment companies.      The Company or FS Investments may terminate the expense reimbursement agreement at any time. FS
Investments has indicated that it expects to continue such reimbursements until it deems that the Company has achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that it bears a reasonable level of expenses in relation to its income. The specific
amount of expenses reimbursed by FS Investments, if any, will be determined at the end of each quarter. Upon termination of the expense reimbursement agreement by FS Investments, FS Investments will be required to fund any amounts accrued thereunder
as of the date of termination. Similarly, the Company s conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the expense reimbursement agreement shall survive the termination of such agreement by either party.   
  During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, the Company accrued $666 for expense
reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay. These reimbursements were funded, in part, through the offset of management fees payable by the Company to FSIC IV Advisor. During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations)
through September 30, 2016, the Company received $366 in cash reimbursements from FS Investments and offset $300 in management fees payable by the Company to FSIC IV Advisor under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement against
reimbursements due from FS Investments. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any reimbursements due from FS Investments.      As discussed above, under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to the Company by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by the Company in the future. During the period from
January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, the Company did not accrue any expense recoupments payable to FS Investments.

  The annualized rate of distributions per share is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount as of the end of the applicable period
(which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of such date without compounding), divided by the Company s public offering price per share as of such date.     
  FS Investments is controlled by the Company s chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, and FS
Investments  co-founder, David J. Adelman. There can be no assurance that the expense reimbursement agreement will remain in effect or that FS Investments will reimburse any portion of the Company s expenses in future quarters.   
   FS Benefit Trust       FS
Benefit Trust was formed as a Delaware statutory trust for the purpose of awarding equity incentive compensation to employees of FS Investments and its affiliates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FS Benefit Trust purchased $1 of the
Company s shares of common stock at a purchase price equal to 97.8% of the public offering price in effect on the purchase date.   
   Note 5. Distributions       The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that the Company declared and paid on its common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:   
   
    The Company currently declares regular cash distributions on a weekly basis and pays such distributions
on a monthly basis. On September 28, 2016, the Company s board of directors determined to increase the amount of the regular weekly cash distributions payable to stockholders of record from $0.012463 per share to $0.012808 per share for the
regular weekly cash distributions for October 2016 through December 2016 that were declared on August 4, 2016. On November 7, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared regular weekly cash distributions for January 2017 through March 2017
in the amount of $0.012808 per share. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to Class T stockholders of record as of weekly record dates previously

determined by the Company s board of directors. The timing and amount of any future distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the
Company s board of directors.      The Company has adopted an  opt in  distribution reinvestment plan for its
stockholders. As a result, if the Company makes a cash distribution, its stockholders will receive the distribution in cash unless they specifically  opt in  to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions
reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder s ability to participate in the distribution
reinvestment plan.      Under the distribution reinvestment plan, cash distributions to participating stockholders are reinvested
in additional shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to the net offering price per share in effect as of the date of issuance. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of common stock will generally
be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders who elect to participate in the Company s distribution reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which
to pay any such applicable taxes. Stockholders receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of the fair market value of shares of the Company s common stock.
     The Company may fund its cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including
offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred
and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from FS Investments. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the
Company s distributions may exceed its earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment
rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the
sale of securities, and/or a return of capital, which is a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to the Company s stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all.
     For a period of time following commencement of the Company s continuous public offering, which time period may be
significant, substantial portions of the Company s distributions have been, and may in the future, be funded through the reimbursement of certain expenses by FS Investments and its affiliates, including through the waiver of certain investment
advisory fees by FSIC IV Advisor, that are subject to repayment by the Company within three years. The purpose of this arrangement is to ensure that no portion of the Company s distributions to stockholders will be paid from offering proceeds
or borrowings. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory fees are not based on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in
future periods and/or FS Investments continues to make such reimbursements or waivers of such fees. The Company s future repayments of amounts reimbursed or waived by FS Investments or its affiliates will reduce the distributions that
stockholders would otherwise receive in the future. FS Investments and its affiliates have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods. If FS Investments had not reimbursed certain of the Company s
expenses, 28% of the aggregate amount of distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 would have been funded from offering proceeds or borrowings.

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 93.5% of the Company s gross investment income was attributable to cash income earned, 5.2% was attributable to
non-cash accretion of discount and 1.3% was attributed to paid-in-kind interest, or PIK, interest.        The
Company s net investment income on a tax basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,415. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $690 of undistributed net investment income and realized gains on a tax basis.   
  The difference between the Company s GAAP-basis net investment income (loss) and its tax-basis net investment income is primarily
due to the tax-basis deferral and amortization of organization costs, the reversal of the required accrual for GAAP purposes of incentive fees on unrealized gains even though no such incentive fees on unrealized gains are payable by the Company, the
reclassification of unamortized original issue discount and prepayment fees recognized upon payment of loans from income for GAAP purposes to realized gains for tax purposes and the tax basis net investment income portion of the total return swap
payments.      The following table sets forth a reconciliation between GAAP-basis net investment income (loss) and tax-basis net

   The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made
annually as of the end of the Company s fiscal year based upon the Company s taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the
actual tax attributes of the Company s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV.   
  As of September 30, 2016, the components of accumulated earnings on a tax basis were as follows:   

The aggregate cost of the Company s investments,
including the accretion of discount on the TRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes totaled $51,347 as of September 30, 2016. The aggregate net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on a tax basis, including the Company s TRS, was $2,779 as
of September 30, 2016.       Note 6. Investment Portfolio       The following table summarizes the composition of the Company s investment portfolio at cost and fair value as of September 30, 2016:

  Amortized cost represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of premiums and/or accretion of discounts, as applicable, on investments.
       As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not  control  and was not an  affiliated person 
of any of its portfolio companies, each as defined in the 1940 Act. In general, under the 1940 Act, the Company would be presumed to  control  a portfolio company if it owned more than 25% of its voting securities or it had the power to
exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company, and would be an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if it owned 5% or more of its voting securities.   
  The Company s investment portfolio may contain loans and other unfunded arrangements that are in the form of lines of credit,
revolving credit facilities, delayed draw credit facilities or other investments, pursuant to which the Company may be required to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying
agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had two unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $1,375. The Company maintains sufficient cash on hand and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the
need arise. For additional details regarding the Company s unfunded debt investments, see the Company s unaudited consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016.

    Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  Under existing accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. This accounting guidance emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are
inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.   
  The Company classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy as defined by current accounting
guidance:       Level 1 : Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
      Level 2 : Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.   
   Level 3 : Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability.   
  A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company s investments and total return swap were
categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy:       
    The Company s investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were
traded on a private over-the-counter market for institutional investors. Four senior secured loan investments, for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such
investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the
investments. All of the Company s equity/other investments were also valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such
investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income or revenues. Except as described above, the Company valued its other investments by
using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent third-party pricing service and screened for validity by such service.   
  The Company values the TRS in accordance with the agreements between Cheltenham Funding and Citibank that collectively established the
TRS, which agreements are collectively referred to herein as the TRS   
         24

Agreement. Pursuant to the TRS Agreement, the value of the TRS is based on the increase or decrease in the value of the loans underlying the TRS, together with accrued interest income, interest
expense and certain other expenses incurred under the TRS. The loans underlying the TRS are valued by Citibank. Citibank bases its valuation on the indicative bid prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the
highest price that market participants may be willing to pay. These valuations are sent to the Company for review and testing. The valuation committee of the Company s board of directors, or the valuation committee, and the board of directors
review and approve the value of the TRS, as well as the value of the loans underlying the TRS, on a quarterly basis as part of their quarterly determination of net asset value. To the extent the Company s valuation committee or board of
directors has any questions or concerns regarding the valuation of the loans underlying the TRS, such valuation is discussed or challenged pursuant to the terms of the TRS Agreement. For additional information on the Company s TRS, see Note 8.
     The Company periodically benchmarks the bid and ask prices it receives from the third-party pricing services and/or dealers,
as applicable, against the actual prices at which the Company purchases and sells its investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of the Company s management in purchasing and selling these investments, the
Company believes that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), the Company believes that these valuation inputs are
classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company may also use other methods, including the use of an independent valuation firm, to determine fair value for securities for which it cannot obtain prevailing bid and ask prices
through third-party pricing services or independent dealers, or where the Company s board of directors otherwise determines that the use of such other methods is appropriate. The Company periodically benchmarks the valuations provided by the
independent valuation firms against the actual prices at which the Company purchases and sells its investments. The valuation committee of the Company s board of directors and the board of directors reviewed and approved the valuation
determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with the Company s valuation policy.

       Note 7. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments (continued)        
   The following is a reconciliation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of
investments for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in determining fair value:       
    The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in recurring Level 3 fair value
measurements as of September 30, 2016 were as follows:       

(1)  
  Investments using a market quotes valuation technique were valued by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant
period end, which was provided by an independent third-party pricing service and screened for validity by such service. For investments utilizing a market comparables valuation technique, a significant increase (decrease) in the market yield, in
isolation, would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, and a significant increase (decrease) in any of the valuation multiples, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

    Note 8. Financing Arrangement    
  The following table presents summary information with respect to the Company s outstanding financing arrangement as of September 30,
2016. For additional information regarding this financing arrangement, please see the notes to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements contained in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the
additional disclosure set forth in this Note 8.       

(1)  
  The TRS may be terminated by Cheltenham Funding at any time, subject to payment of an early termination fee if prior to January 19, 2017, or by Citibank on or after
January 19, 2017, in each case, in whole or in part, upon prior written notice to the other party.         Citibank Total Return
Swap       On January 19, 2016, the Company s wholly-owned financing subsidiary, Cheltenham Funding, entered into the TRS
for a portfolio of senior secured floating rate loans with Citibank. The TRS has subsequently been amended three times resulting in the maximum aggregate notional amount of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS being increased from $20,000
originally to $125,000 effective as of June 30, 2016.      A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments
to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or securities indices during a specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed
or variable interest rate. A TRS effectively adds leverage to a portfolio by providing investment exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or investing directly in such market. Because of the unique
structure of a TRS, a TRS often offers lower financing costs than are offered through more traditional borrowing arrangements.   
  The TRS with Citibank enables the Company, through its ownership of Cheltenham Funding, to obtain the economic benefit of owning the
loans subject to the TRS, without actually owning them, in return for an interest-type payment to Citibank. As such, the TRS is analogous to Cheltenham Funding borrowing funds to acquire loans and incurring interest expense to a lender.   
  Until the date on which the reference portfolio under the TRS meets the full set of diversity and other portfolio criteria required under
the TRS documents, or the Portfolio Criteria Satisfaction Date, the Company will guarantee Cheltenham Funding s obligations under the TRS, or the Guarantee. Thereafter, the Guarantee will terminate and the obligations of Cheltenham Funding
under the TRS will be non-recourse to the Company. Accordingly, on and after the Portfolio Criteria Satisfaction Date, the Company s exposure under the TRS will be limited to the value of the Company s investment in Cheltenham Funding,
which generally will equal the value of cash collateral provided by Cheltenham Funding under the TRS.      Pursuant to the terms
of the TRS, Cheltenham Funding may select a portfolio of loans with a maximum aggregate market value (determined at the time each such loan becomes subject to the TRS) of $125,000. Cheltenham Funding is required to initially cash collateralize a
specified percentage of each loan included under the TRS in accordance with margin requirements described in the agreements between Cheltenham Funding and Citibank that collectively establish the TRS, or collectively, the TRS Agreement. Under the
terms of the TRS,

       Note 8. Financing Arrangement (continued)

Cheltenham Funding has agreed not to draw upon, or post as collateral, such cash collateral in respect of other financings or operating requirements prior to the termination of the TRS. Neither
the cash collateral required to be posted with Citibank nor any other assets of Cheltenham Funding are available to pay the debts of the Company.      Pursuant to the terms of an investment management agreement that the Company has entered into with Cheltenham Funding, the Company acts as the investment manager of the rights and obligations of
Cheltenham Funding under the TRS, including selecting the specific loans to be included in the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS. Accordingly, the loans selected by Cheltenham Funding for purposes of the TRS are selected by the Company in
accordance with its investment objectives and strategy to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the TRS, Cheltenham Funding may select any loan or obligation available
in the market to be included in the portfolio of loans that meets the obligation criteria set forth in the TRS Agreement.   
  Each individual loan, and the portfolio of loans taken as a whole, must meet criteria described in the TRS Agreement, including a
requirement that substantially all of the loans underlying the TRS be rated by Moody s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s, and Standard   Poor s Ratings Services, or S P, and quoted by (a) at least three
nationally-recognized pricing services prior to the Portfolio Criteria Satisfaction Date and (b) thereafter, at least two nationally-recognized pricing services or just one nationally recognized pricing service so long as the underlying loan
meets other specified criteria. Under the terms of the TRS, Citibank, as calculation agent, determines whether there has been a failure to satisfy the portfolio criteria in the TRS. If such failure continues for 30 days following the delivery of
notice thereof, then Citibank has the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the TRS. Cheltenham Funding receives from Citibank all interest and fees payable in respect of the loans included in the portfolio. Cheltenham Funding pays to Citibank
interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR, plus (a) 1.60% per annum prior to the Portfolio Criteria Satisfaction Date and (b) thereafter, 1.50% per annum, in both cases on the full notional amount of the loans subject to the
TRS. In addition, upon the termination or repayment of any loan subject to the TRS, Cheltenham Funding will either receive from Citibank the appreciation in the value of such loan or pay to Citibank any depreciation in the value of such loan.
     Under the terms of the TRS, Cheltenham Funding may be required to post additional cash collateral, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, in the event of depreciation in the value of the underlying loans below a specified amount. The limit on the additional collateral that Cheltenham Funding may be required to post pursuant to the TRS is equal to the difference between the full
notional amount of the loans underlying the TRS and the amount of cash collateral already posted by Cheltenham Funding. The amount of collateral required to be posted by Cheltenham Funding is determined primarily on the basis of the aggregate value
of the underlying loans.      Except as required under the Guarantee, the Company has no contractual obligation to post any such
additional collateral or to make any interest payments to Citibank. When the Guarantee is no longer in effect and payment thereunder to satisfy Cheltenham Funding s obligations is no longer required, the Company may, but is not obligated to,
increase its equity investment in Cheltenham Funding for the purpose of funding any additional collateral or payment obligations for which Cheltenham Funding may become obligated during the term of the TRS. If the Company does not make any such
additional investment in Cheltenham Funding and Cheltenham Funding fails to meet its obligations under the TRS, then Citibank will have the right to terminate the TRS and seize the cash collateral posted by Cheltenham Funding under the TRS. In the
event of an early termination of the TRS, Cheltenham Funding would be required to pay an early termination fee.

   Citibank may terminate the TRS on or after January 19, 2017, the first anniversary
of the effectiveness of the TRS (unless certain specified events permit Citibank to terminate the TRS on an earlier date). Cheltenham Funding may terminate the TRS at any time upon providing no more than 30 days, and no less than 10 days, prior
notice to Citibank. Cheltenham Funding will be required to pay an early termination fee to Citibank if it elects to terminate the TRS prior to the one year anniversary of the effective date. Under the terms of the TRS, the early termination fee will
equal the present value of a stream of monthly payments based on the minimum utilization amount, which would be owed by Cheltenham Funding to Citibank for the period from the termination date through and including January 19, 2017. Such monthly
payments will equal the present value of the product of (x) 85%, multiplied by (y) the maximum notional amount of the TRS ($125,000), multiplied by (z) 1.60% or 1.50% per annum, as applicable. If the TRS had been terminated as of
September 30, 2016, Cheltenham Funding would have been required to pay an early termination fee of $376. Other than during the first 90 days and last 30 days of the term of the TRS, Cheltenham Funding is required to pay a minimum usage fee if less
than 85% of the maximum notional amount of the TRS is utilized and an unused fee on any amounts unutilized if greater than 85% but less than 100% of the maximum notional amount of the TRS is utilized.   
  The value of the TRS is based primarily on the valuation of the underlying portfolio of loans subject to the TRS. Pursuant to the terms
of the TRS, on each business day, Citibank values each underlying loan in good faith on a mark-to-market basis by determining how much Citibank would receive on such date if it sold the loan in the open market. Citibank reports the mark-to-market
values of the underlying loans to Cheltenham Funding.      As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of the TRS was $1,902. The net
change in fair value of the TRS is reflected as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on total return swap on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The change in value of the TRS is reflected in the Company s consolidated statements
of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on total return swap. As of September 30, 2016, Cheltenham Funding had selected 38 underlying loans with a total notional amount of $117,507 and posted $45,000 in cash collateral
held by Citibank (of which only $41,560 was required to be posted), which is reflected in due from counterparty on the consolidated balance sheet.      For purposes of the asset coverage ratio test applicable to the Company as a BDC, the Company treats the outstanding notional amount of the TRS, less the initial amount of any cash collateral required to
be posted by Cheltenham Funding under the TRS, as a senior security for the life of that instrument. The Company may, however, accord different treatment to the TRS in the future in accordance with any applicable new rules or interpretations adopted
by the staff of the SEC.      Further, for purposes of Section 55(a) under the 1940 Act, the Company treats each loan underlying
the TRS as a qualifying asset if the obligor on such loan is an eligible portfolio company and as a non-qualifying asset if the obligor is not an eligible portfolio company. The Company may, however, accord different treatment to the TRS in the
future in accordance with any applicable new rules or interpretations adopted by the staff of the SEC.

    Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies    
  The Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification provisions. The Company s maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown; however, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts. Management of FSIC IV Advisor has reviewed the Company s existing contracts and expects the risk of loss to the Company to be remote.
     The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings and, to the Company s knowledge, no material
legal proceedings are threatened against the Company. From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of the Company s rights under
contracts with its portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect that any such proceedings will have a material effect upon its financial condition or results of
operations.      See Note 4 for a discussion of the Company s commitments to FSIC IV Advisor and its affiliates (including FS
Investments) and Note 6 for a discussion of the Company s unfunded commitments.

(3)  
  The per share data for distributions reflects the actual amount of distributions paid per share during the period.     

(4)  
  The issuance of common stock on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock in the
Company s continuous public offering and pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The issuance of common stock at an offering price, net of selling commissions, that is greater than the net asset value per share results in
an increase in net asset value per share.         

(5)  
  The per share impact of the Company s repurchases of common shares was a reduction to net asset value of less than $0.01 per share during each period.

(6)  
  The total return for the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016 was calculated based on the change in net asset value
during the period, including the impact of distributions reinvested in accordance with the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The total return does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in
connection with the sale of shares of the Company s common stock. The total return includes the effect of the issuance of shares at a net offering price that is greater than net asset value per share, which causes an increase in net asset value
per share. The historical calculation of total return in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return, which may be greater or less than the return shown in the table due to a number of factors,
including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of the Company s expenses, variations in and
the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not
be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. The total return calculation set forth above represents the total return on the Company s investment portfolio during the period and does not represent an actual return to
stockholders.         

(7)  
  The total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) for the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016 was
calculated by taking the net asset value per share as of the end of the period, adding the cash distributions per share which were declared during the period and dividing the total by the net asset value per share at the beginning of the period. The
total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) does not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of the Company s common shares. The total return (without
assuming reinvestment of distributions) includes the effect of the issuance of shares at a net offering price that is greater than net asset value per share, which causes an increase in net asset value per share. The historical calculation of total
return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions) in the table should not be considered a representation of the Company s future total return (without assuming reinvestment of distributions), which may be greater or less than the return
shown in the table due to a number of factors, including the Company s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet its investment criteria, the interest rates payable on the debt securities the Company acquires, the level of
the Company s expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which the Company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these
factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. The total return calculation set forth above represents the total return on the Company s investment portfolio during the
period and does not represent an actual return to stockholders.

future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in our operating areas.      
  We have based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to us on the
date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Stockholders are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to stockholders or through reports that we may file in the future with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
and current reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.       Overview       We were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on February 25, 2015 and formally commenced investment operations on January 6, 2016 upon raising the minimum
offering requirement from sales of shares of our Class T common stock in our continuous public offering to persons who were not affiliated with us or FSIC IV Advisor. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and intends to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Prior to satisfying the minimum
offering requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization.      Our investment activities are
managed by FSIC IV Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. Under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we have agreed to pay FSIC IV Advisor an annual base management fee based
on the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. FSIC IV Advisor has engaged GDFM to act as our investment sub-adviser. GDFM assists FSIC IV Advisor in identifying investment opportunities and makes
investment recommendations for approval by FSIC IV Advisor according to guidelines set by FSIC IV Advisor.      Our investment
objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We have identified and intend to focus on the following investment categories, which we believe will allow us to generate an attractive total return
with an acceptable level of risk.       Direct Originations : We intend to leverage our relationship with GDFM and its global
sourcing and origination platform, including its industry relationships, to directly source investment opportunities. Such investments are originated or structured for us or made by us and are not generally available to the broader market. These
investments may include both debt and equity components, although we do not generally make equity investments independent of having an existing credit relationship. We believe directly originated investments may offer higher returns and more
favorable protections than broadly syndicated transactions.       Opportunistic : We intend to seek to capitalize on market
price inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds and other securities where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than deemed warranted by our fundamental analysis. We believe that market price inefficiencies may occur due to,
among other things, general dislocations in the markets, a misunderstanding by the market of a particular company or an industry being out of favor with the broader investment community. We seek to allocate capital to these securities that have been
misunderstood or mispriced by the market and where we believe there is an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. Such opportunities may include event driven investments, anchor orders and CLOs.   
  In the case of event driven investments, we intend to take advantage of dislocations that arise in the markets due to an impending event
and where the market s apparent expectation of value differs substantially from our   
         36   

Table of Contents  

fundamental analysis. Such events may include a looming debt maturity or default, a merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization, an adverse regulatory or legal ruling, or a material
contract expiration, any of which may significantly improve or impair a company s financial position. Compared to other investment strategies, event driven investing depends more heavily on our ability to successfully predict the outcome of an
individual event rather than on underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, successful event driven strategies may offer both substantial diversification benefits and the ability to generate performance in uncertain market environments.
     We may also invest in certain opportunities that are originated and then syndicated by a commercial or investment bank, but
where we provide a capital commitment significantly above the average syndicate participant, i.e., an anchor order. In these types of investments, we may receive fees, preferential pricing or other benefits not available to other lenders in return
for our significant capital commitment. Our decision to provide an anchor order to a syndicated transaction is predicated on a rigorous credit analysis, our familiarity with a particular company, industry or financial sponsor, and the broader
investment experiences of FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM.      In addition, our relationship with GSO Capital Partners LP, the parent of
GDFM and one of the largest CLO managers in the world, allows us to opportunistically invest in CLOs. CLOs are a form of securitization where the cash flow from a pooled basket of syndicated loans is used to support distribution payments made to
different tranches of securities. While collectively CLOs represent nearly fifty percent of the broadly syndicated loan universe, investing in individual CLO tranches requires a high degree of investor sophistication due to their structural
complexity and the illiquid nature of their securities.       Broadly Syndicated/Other : Although our primary focus is to
invest in directly originated transactions and opportunistic investments, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our
directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we typically receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage
the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that maximizes the levered return potential of our portfolio.   
  Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured loans and second lien secured loans of private middle market U.S.
companies and, to a lesser extent, subordinated loans of private U.S. companies. Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be comprised of subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may
invest. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the  over-the-counter  market or directly from our target companies as
primary market or directly originated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase or otherwise acquire minority
interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock or other equity or the cash value of common stock or other equity, in our target
companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm. In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be comprised of corporate
bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. FSIC IV Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or
decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments. Prior to raising sufficient capital, we may make smaller investments than we expect to make once we raise sufficient capital due to
liquidity constraints. Once we raise sufficient capital, we expect that our investments will generally range between $5 million and $150 million each, although investments may vary proportionately with the size of our capital base and will
ultimately be made at the discretion of FSIC IV Advisor, subject to oversight by our board of directors.   
         37

   The senior secured loans, second lien secured loans and senior secured bonds in which we
will invest generally have stated terms of three to seven years and subordinated debt investments that we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and seven
years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security in our portfolio. Our debt investments may be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below
investment grade (rated lower than  Baa3  by Moody s or lower than  BBB-  by S P). We also invest in non-rated debt securities.       Revenues       The principal measure of our financial performance is net
increase in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on total return swap, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net
unrealized appreciation or depreciation on total return swap.      Net investment income is the difference between our income from
interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost.
Net realized gain or loss on total return swap is the net monthly settlement payments received on the TRS. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Net unrealized
appreciation or depreciation on total return swap is the net change in the fair value of the TRS.      We principally generate
revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance,
consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized as earned. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or
other securities we hold.       Expenses       Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, interest expense from our
financing arrangement and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate FSIC IV Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our
investments. FSIC IV Advisor is responsible for compensating our investment sub-adviser.      We reimburse FSIC IV Advisor for
expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FSIC IV Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services
to us on behalf of FSIC IV Advisor. Such services include the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations and other administrative services. FSIC IV Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance
of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition,
FSIC IV Advisor assists us in calculating the net asset value for each share class, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our
expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.      In addition, we have
contracted with State Street Bank and Trust Company to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review

by FSIC IV Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with
respect to RIC compliance.       Expense Reimbursement       Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse us for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of our distributions to stockholders will
be paid from offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments we may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other distributions to us that are treated for tax purposes as a return of
capital, a portion of our distributions to stockholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital to the extent that we may use such dividends or other distribution proceeds to fund our distributions to stockholders. Under those
circumstances, FS Investments will not reimburse us for the portion of such distributions to stockholders that represent a return of capital, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to
stockholders.      Under the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments will reimburse us for expenses in an amount equal to
the difference between our cumulative distributions paid to our stockholders in each quarter, less the sum of our net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and
common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in each quarter.      Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, we have a conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by FS Investments under such agreement if (and only to the extent
that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of our net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions
paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the cumulative distributions paid by us to our stockholders
during such quarter; provided, however, that (i) we will only reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter to the extent that the payment of such reimbursement (together with
any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause  other operating expenses  (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support payments received by us during such fiscal year) to exceed the lesser
of (A) 1.75% of our average net assets attributable to shares of our common stock for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such payments into account and (B) the percentage of our average net assets attributable to shares of our
common stock represented by  other operating expenses  during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment
which relates to an expense support payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year) and (ii) we will not reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments for any calendar quarter if the annualized rate
of regular cash distributions declared by us at the time of such reimbursement payment is less than the annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by us at the time FS Investments made the expense support payment to which such
reimbursement payment relates. We are not obligated to pay interest on the reimbursements we are required to make to FS Investments under the expense reimbursement agreement.  Other operating expenses  means our total  operating
expenses  (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, distribution fees, organization and offering costs, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses.  Operating
expenses  means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for investment companies.   
  We or FS Investments may terminate the expense reimbursement agreement at any time. FS Investments has indicated that it expects to
continue such reimbursements until it deems that we have achieved economies of scale sufficient to ensure that we bear a reasonable level of expenses in relation to our income. The specific amount of expenses reimbursed by FS Investments, if any,
will be determined at the end of each quarter.   
         39

   Upon termination of the expense reimbursement agreement by FS Investments, FS Investments
will be required to fund any amounts accrued thereunder as of the date of termination. Similarly, our conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the expense reimbursement agreement shall survive the termination of
such agreement by either party.      During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30,
2016, we accrued $666 for expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay. These reimbursements were funded, in part, through the offset of management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor. During the period from January 6, 2016
(Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, we received $366 in cash reimbursements from FS Investments and offset $300 in management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor under the investment advisory and administrative services
agreement against reimbursements due from FS Investments. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any reimbursements due from FS Investments.      As discussed above, under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in the future. During the period from January 6, 2016
(Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, we did not accrue any expense recoupments payable to FS Investments.   
  The following table reflects the expense reimbursement payment due from FS Investments to us as of September 30, 2016 that may become
subject to repayment by us to FS Investments:       

(1)  
  The annualized rate of distributions per share is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount as of the end of the applicable period
(which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of such date without compounding), divided by our public offering price per share as of such date.     
  FS Investments is controlled by our chairman, president and chief executive officer, Michael C. Forman, and FS Investments co-founder,
David J. Adelman. There can be no assurance that the expense reimbursement agreement will remain in effect or that FS Investments will reimburse any portion of our expenses in future quarters.   
   Portfolio Investment Activity for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and for the Period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations)
through September 30, 2016       During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016,
we made investments in portfolio companies totaling $123,560. During the same period, we sold investments for proceeds of $69,960 and received principal repayments of $3,112. As of September 30, 2016, our investment portfolio, with a total fair
value of $52,225 (56% in first lien senior secured loans, 21% in second lien senior secured loans, 22% in subordinated debt and 1% in equity and other investments), consisted of interests in 16 portfolio companies. The portfolio companies that
comprised our portfolio as of such date had an average annual EBITDA of approximately $172.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, the debt investments in our portfolio were purchased at a weighted average price of 96.3% of par and our estimated gross
portfolio yield (which represents the expected annualized yield to be generated by us on our investment portfolio based on the composition of our portfolio as of such date), prior to leverage, was 9.3% based upon the amortized cost of our
investments.

   Based on our regular weekly cash distribution amount of $0.012463 per share as of September
30, 2016 and our public offering price of $11.10 per share as of such date, the annualized distribution rate to stockholders as of September 30, 2016 was 5.84%. The annualized distribution rate to stockholders is expressed as a percentage equal to
the projected annualized distribution amount per share divided by our public offering price per share as of September 30, 2016. Our annualized distribution rate to stockholders may include income, realized capital gains and a return of
investors  capital.      Our estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than a stockholder s yield on an investment
in shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us. In addition, our estimated gross portfolio yield disclosed above does not consider the effect of any selling
commissions or charges that may have been incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our estimated gross portfolio yield and annualized distribution rate to stockholders do not represent actual investment returns to
stockholders, are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates set forth above. See the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015

   As of September 30, 2016, we did not  control  and were not an  affiliated
person  of any of our portfolio companies, each as defined in the 1940 Act. In general, under the 1940 Act, we would be presumed to  control  a portfolio company if we owned more than 25% of its voting securities or we had the power
to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company, and would be an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if we owned 5% or more of its voting securities.   
  Our investment portfolio may contain loans and other unfunded arrangements that are in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit
facilities, delayed draw credit facilities or other investments, pursuant to which we may be required to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. As of September 30, 2016,
we had two unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $1,375. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. For additional details regarding our unfunded debt
investments, see our unaudited consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016.       Portfolio Asset Quality    
  In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, FSIC IV Advisor uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor
the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. FSIC IV Advisor uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:   

Investment       Rating    
      
     Summary Description     

1   
      
  Investment exceeding expectations and/or capital gain expected.   
 
    2   
      
  Performing investment generally executing in accordance with the portfolio company s business plan full return of principal and interest expected.   
 
    3   
      
  Performing investment requiring closer monitoring.   
 
    4   
      
  Underperforming investment some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment.   
 
    5   
      
  Underperforming investment with expected loss of interest and some principal.   
    The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at
fair value as of September 30, 2016:       
    The amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period
resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in
investment values.       Results of Operations       We commenced investment operations on January 6, 2016, when we raised in excess of $1,000 from persons who were not affiliated with us or FSIC IV Advisor. Prior to satisfying the minimum offering
  
         44

requirement, we had no operations except for matters relating to our organization. As a result, no comparisons with the comparable 2015 periods have been included.   
   Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and for the Period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through
September 30, 2016        Revenues       We generated investment income of $1,061 and $1,386 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, respectively,
in the form of interest earned on senior secured loans (first and second lien) and subordinated debt securities in our portfolio. Such revenues represent $1,000 and $1,296 of cash income earned as well as $61 and $90 in non-cash portions relating to
accretion of discount and PIK interest for such periods, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized.   
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) to September 30, 2016,
we generated $896 and $1,192, respectively, of interest income, which represented 84.4% and 86.0%, respectively, of total investment income. The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments
multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases and the proportion of directly originated
investments in our portfolio increases.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016
(Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, we generated $165 and $194, respectively, of fee income, which represented 15.6% and 14.0%, respectively, of total investment income. Such fee income is transaction based, and typically
consists of prepayment fees, structuring fees, amendment and consent fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of prepayments and other events at
existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees.       Expenses       Our operating expenses were $1,700 and $3,492 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, respectively. Our
operating expenses for such periods include base management fees attributed to FSIC IV Advisor of $520 and $888, respectively. Our operating expenses for such periods also include administrative services expenses attributed to FSIC IV Advisor of $60
and $180, respectively.      FSIC IV Advisor is eligible to receive incentive fees based on our performance. During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued a capital gains incentive fee of $582 based on the performance of our portfolio. During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, we accrued a capital gains
incentive fee of $800 based on the performance of our portfolio, of which $593 was based on unrealized gains and $207 was based on realized gains. No such fees are actually payable by us with respect to unrealized gains unless and until those gains
are actually realized. See   Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fee  for additional information about how the incentive fees are calculated.       
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30,
2016, fees and expenses incurred with our fund administrator, which provides various accounting and administrative services to us, totaled $13 and $23, respectively, and fees and expenses incurred with our stock transfer agent totaled $47 and $82,
respectively. Fees for our board of directors for such periods were $71 and $117, respectively.   
         45   

Table of Contents  

   Our other general and administrative expenses totaled $121 and $568 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, respectively, and consisted of the following:       
    We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our average
net assets because of the anticipated growth in the size of our asset base.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016
and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, the ratio of our total operating expenses to our average net assets was 1.87% and 6.75%, respectively. During such periods, the ratio of our net expenses to
our average net assets, which includes $0 and $666, respectively, of expense reimbursements from FS Investments, was 1.87% and 5.46%, respectively. During such periods, the ratio of our total operating expenses to average net assets included $582
and $800, respectively, related to accruals for our capital gains incentive fees, and $286 and $517, respectively, related to offering costs. Without such expenses, the ratio of our total operating expenses to average net assets for such periods
would have been 0.91% and 4.20%, respectively. Incentive fees and offering costs may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance.   
   Expense Reimbursement    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30,
2016, we accrued $0 and $666, respectively, for expense reimbursements that FS Investments has agreed to pay. It is intended that these reimbursements will be funded, in part, through the offset of management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor.
Under the expense reimbursement agreement, amounts reimbursed to us by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by us in the future. During the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, we received
$366 in cash reimbursements from FS Investments and offset $300 in management fees payable by us to FSIC IV Advisor under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement against reimbursements due from FS Investments. As of September
30, 2016, we did not have any reimbursements due from FS Investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, we did not accrue any expense
recoupments payable to FS Investments. See   Overview Expense Reimbursement  for a discussion of the expense reimbursement agreement.       Net Investment Income (Loss)       Our net investment income (loss) totaled
$(639) ($(0.07) per share) and $(1,440) ($(0.29) per share), for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, respectively.   
   Net Realized Gains or Losses       We sold investments and received principal repayments of $36,557 and $2,060, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, from which we realized a net gain of $277. We sold investments
and   
         46   

Table of Contents  

received principal repayments of $69,960 and $3,112, respectively, during the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, from which we realized a net
gain of $466. During such periods, we earned $1,660 and $2,395, respectively, from periodic net settlement payments on our TRS, which are reflected as realized gains.       Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Total Return Swap       For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
investments totaled $672 and $1,095, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our TRS was $1,662 and $1,902, respectively, for such periods.       Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations       For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from January 6, 2016 (Commencement of Operations) through September 30, 2016, the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations was $3,632 ($0.42 per share) and $4,418 ($0.88 per
share), respectively.       Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources        Overview       As of September 30, 2016, we had $22,102 in cash, which we held
in a custodial account, and $45,000 in cash held as collateral by Citibank under the terms of the TRS. As of September 30, 2016, we also had broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that could be sold to create additional
liquidity. As of September 30, 2016, we had two unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of $1,375. We maintain sufficient cash on hand and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.   
  We currently generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of the continuous public offering of shares of our Class T common stock and
the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan and from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our
returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FSIC IV Advisor, but in no event will leverage employed exceed 50% of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. See   Financing
Arrangement.       Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from the net proceeds
from our continuous public offering, from the issuance of shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan, from fees, interest earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments, primarily
in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our intention to be taxed as a RIC.
      Continuous Public Offering and Distribution Reinvestment Plan       We are engaged in a continuous public offering of our common stock. We accept subscriptions on a continuous basis and issue shares at weekly closings at prices that must be above our net asset value per
share.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 10,389,506 shares of Class T common stock for gross
proceeds of $112,635 at an average price per share of $10.84. The gross proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include reinvested stockholder distributions of $1,469 for which we issued 137,034 shares of Class T common
stock. The upfront selling commissions related to the sale of our Class T common stock were $2,242 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
         47   

Table of Contents  

   Since commencing our continuous public offering and through November 1, 2016, we have issued
11,429,689 shares of Class T common stock for gross proceeds of $124,209, including Class T common stock issued under our distribution reinvestment plan and $8,964 in gross proceeds raised from the principal of FSIC IV Advisor, certain members
of our board of directors and other individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM. As of November 1, 2016, we had raised total gross proceeds of $124,409, including $200 of seed capital contributed by the principal of FSIC
IV Advisor in February 2015.      We have submitted to the SEC an application for an exemptive order to permit us to offer
additional classes of common stock. If an exemptive order satisfactory to us is granted prior to January 6, 2017, a year from the date we met the minimum offering requirement, we intend to offer additional classes of our common stock with each class
having a different upfront sales load and fee and expense structure. If an exemptive order satisfactory to us is not granted prior to January 6, 2017, we may close the offering of Class T shares (other than shares issued under our distribution
reinvestment plan) and would not issue any additional share classes. We are currently considering alternatives that would allow us to continue the offering after January 6, 2017.       Share Repurchase Program       To provide our stockholders with limited
liquidity, we intend to conduct quarterly tender offers pursuant to our share repurchase program. The first such tender offer commenced in May 2016, and the repurchase occurred in connection with our July 6, 2016 weekly closing.   
  The following table provides information concerning our repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase
program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:       
    On October 5, 2016, we repurchased 9,217 shares of common stock (representing 100% of the shares of
common stock tendered for repurchase and 0.09% of the shares outstanding as of such date) at $10.8558 per share for aggregate consideration totaling $100. For additional information regarding our share repurchase program, see Note 3 to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements included herein.       Financing Arrangement    
  We borrow funds to make investments to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional
investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our
stockholders. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred stock.      The following table presents summary information
with respect to our outstanding financing arrangement as of September 30, 2016:

  The TRS may be terminated by Cheltenham Funding at any time, subject to payment of an early termination fee if prior to January 19, 2017, or by Citibank on or after
January 19, 2017, in each case, in whole or in part, upon prior written notice to the other party.        For
additional information regarding our financing arrangement, see Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein.   
   RIC Status and Distributions       We intend to elect, and to qualify annually, to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any
ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. In order to qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90% of our investment
company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of a tax year or the due
date of the tax return for such tax year, including extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make
sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our RIC tax status each tax year. We will also generally be subject to nondeductible federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a
timely manner to our stockholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income,
which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses or  capital gain net income  (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income
and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to
stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. stockholders, on December 31 of the
calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. If we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing
so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.      Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we currently intend to declare regular cash distributions on a weekly basis and pay such distributions on a
monthly basis. We will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each stockholder s distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept such stockholder s
subscription for shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. The timing and amount of any future
distributions to stockholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors.   
  During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the
proceeds from our continuous public offering of our common stock. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment
rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FSIC IV Advisor. Each
year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders. If FS Investments had not reimbursed certain of our expenses, 28% of the aggregate amount of distributions paid during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 would have been funded from offering proceeds or borrowings.   
         49

   We intend to continue to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets
legally available for distribution, unless stockholders elect to receive their cash distributions in additional shares of our common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain
taxable to a U.S. stockholder.      The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we declared and paid on our
common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:       
    On September 28, 2016, our board of directors determined to increase the amount of the regular weekly
cash distributions payable to stockholders of record from $0.012463 per share to $0.012808 per share for the regular weekly cash distributions for October 2016 through December 2016 that were declared on August 4, 2016. On November 7, 2016, our
board of directors declared regular weekly cash distributions for January 2017 through March 2017 in the amount of $0.012808 per share. These distributions have been or will be paid monthly to Class T stockholders of record as of weekly record dates
previously determined by our board of directors.      We have adopted an  opt in  distribution reinvestment plan for our
stockholders. As a result, if we make a cash distribution, our stockholders will receive the distribution in cash unless they specifically  opt in  to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in
additional shares of our common stock. However, certain state authorities or regulators may impose restrictions from time to time that may prevent or limit a stockholder s ability to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan.
     Under the distribution reinvestment plan, cash distributions to participating stockholders are reinvested in additional
shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to the net offering price per share in effect as of the date of issuance. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal,
state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders who elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.
Stockholders receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution in the amount of the fair market value of our shares of common stock.   
  We may fund our cash distributions to stockholders from any sources of funds legally available to us, including offering proceeds,
borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments
in portfolio companies and expense reimbursements from FS Investments. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make distributions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions
at a specific rate or at all.      Pursuant to the expense reimbursement agreement, FS Investments has agreed to reimburse us for
expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of our distributions to stockholders will be paid from our offering proceeds or borrowings. For a period of time following commencement of our continuous public offering, which time
period may be significant, substantial portions of our distributions have been, and may in the future, be funded through the reimbursement of certain expenses by FS Investments and its affiliates, including through the waiver of certain investment
advisory fees by FSIC IV Advisor, that are subject to repayment by us within three years. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory fees are not based on our investment performance, and can only be sustained
if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or FS Investments and its affiliates continue to make such   
         50   

Table of Contents  

reimbursements or waivers of such fees. Our future repayments of amounts reimbursed or waived by FS Investments or its affiliates will reduce the distributions that stockholders would otherwise
receive in the future. FS Investments and its affiliates, including FSIC IV Advisor, have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods.

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 93.5% of our gross investment income was attributable to cash income earned, 5.2% was attributable to non-cash
accretion of discount and 1.3% was attributed to PIK interest.        Our net investment income on a tax basis for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,415. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $690 of undistributed net investment income and realized gains on a tax basis.      See Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our distributions, including a reconciliation of our GAAP-basis net investment income to
our tax-basis net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Critical Accounting Policies    
  Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of
management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial
statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing
the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to
materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. As we execute our
operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below.       Valuation of Portfolio Investments       We determine the net asset value of our
investment portfolio each quarter. Securities are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, FSIC IV Advisor   
         51   

Table of Contents  

provides our board of directors with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent
portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party valuation services.   
  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC
Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier
fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar
securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to
develop its own assumptions.      With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake
a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:       

our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FSIC IV Advisor s management team reviewing and documenting valuations of each portfolio company
or investment, which valuations may be obtained from an independent third-party valuation service, if applicable;          

FSIC IV Advisor s management team then provides the valuation committee with the preliminary valuations for each portfolio company or investment;

preliminary valuations are then discussed with the valuation committee;      

the valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations and FSIC IV Advisor s management team, together with our independent third-party
valuation services, if applicable, supplement the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee;          

following its review, the valuation committee will recommend that our board of directors approve our fair valuations; and      

our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each such investment in our portfolio in good faith based on various
statistical and other factors, including the input and recommendation of FSIC IV Advisor, the valuation committee and any independent third-party valuation services, if applicable.      
  Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements
refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, our board of directors may use any approved
independent third-party pricing or valuation services. However, our board of directors is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information
obtained from FSIC IV Advisor or any approved independent third-party valuation or pricing service that our board of directors deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FSIC IV
Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may consider when determining the fair value of our investments.   
  Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest
rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we may incorporate these factors into discounted cash
flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that may be   
         52   

Table of Contents  

considered include the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of
collateral securing our debt investments.      For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value
of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used.   
  Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market will be valued at fair value. Our board of
directors, in its determination of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income or revenue. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio
company or our actual investment position. For example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items.   
  FSIC IV Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may also
consider private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. FSIC
IV Advisor s management team, any approved independent third-party valuation services and our board of directors may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, and may apply discounts or
premiums, where and as appropriate, due to the higher (or lower) financial risk and/or the smaller size of portfolio companies relative to comparable firms, as well as such other factors as our board of directors, in consultation with FSIC IV
Advisor s management team and any approved independent third-party valuation services, if applicable, may consider relevant in assessing fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations
are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security.   
  When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security,
the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. Our board of directors subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities
received at their fair value.      The fair values of our investments are determined in good faith by our board of directors. Our
board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process. Our board of directors has delegated
day-to-day responsibility for implementing our valuation policy to FSIC IV Advisor s management team, and has authorized FSIC IV Advisor s management team to utilize independent third-party valuation and pricing services that have been
approved by our board of directors. The valuation committee is responsible for overseeing FSIC IV Advisor s implementation of the valuation process.      Our investments as of September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of debt investments that were traded on a private over-the-counter market for institutional investors. Four senior secured loan investments,
for which broker quotes were not available, were valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing
interest rates for like investments, expected cash flows, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the investment. All of our equity/other investments were also valued by an independent valuation firm, which determined the
fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value
or liquidation value. Except as described above, we valued our other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent third-party
pricing service and screened for validity by such service.   
         53

   We value the TRS in accordance with the TRS Agreement. Pursuant to the TRS Agreement, the
value of the TRS is based on the increase or decrease in the value of the loans underlying the TRS, together with accrued interest income, interest expense and certain other expenses incurred under the TRS. The loans underlying the TRS are valued by
Citibank. Citibank bases its valuation on the indicative bid prices provided by an independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that market participants may be willing to pay. These valuations are sent to us for
review and testing. Our valuation committee and board of directors review and approve the value of the TRS, as well as the value of the loans underlying the TRS, on a quarterly basis as part of their quarterly determination of net asset value. To
the extent our valuation committee or board of directors has any questions or concerns regarding the valuation of the loans underlying the TRS, such valuation is discussed or challenged pursuant to the terms of the TRS Agreement. See Note 8 to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on the TRS.      We periodically benchmark
the bid and ask prices we receive from the third-party pricing services and/or dealers, as applicable, against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of our
management in purchasing and selling these investments, we believe that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. However, because of the private nature of this marketplace (meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported), we
believe that these valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. We may also use other methods, including the use of an independent valuation firm, to determine fair value for securities for which we cannot obtain
prevailing bid and ask prices through third-party pricing services or independent dealers, or where our board of directors otherwise determines that the use of such other methods is appropriate. We periodically benchmark the valuations provided by
the independent valuation firms against the actual prices at which we purchase and sell our investments. The valuation committee and our board of directors reviewed and approved the valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in
a manner consistent with our valuation policy.       Revenue Recognition    
  Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to
collect such amounts. We record dividend income on the ex-dividend date. We do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income. Our policy is to place investments
on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that interest income will be collected. We consider many factors relevant to an investment when placing it on or removing it from non-accrual status including, but not limited to, the delinquency
status of the investment, economic and business conditions, the overall financial condition of the underlying investment, the value of the underlying collateral, bankruptcy status, if any, and any other facts or circumstances relevant to the
investment. If there is reasonable doubt that we will receive any previously accrued interest, then the interest income will be written-off. Payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending
upon the collectability of the remaining principal and interest. Non-accrual investments may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are likely to remain current based on our judgment.   
  Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and we amortize such amounts as interest income over
the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees and original issue discount are recorded as interest income. Structuring and other non-recurring upfront fees are recorded
as fee income when earned. We record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when we receive such amounts.       Net Realized
Gains or Losses, Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses on Foreign Currency       Gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or
sale and the   
         54   

Table of Contents  

amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. Net change in unrealized gains or losses on
foreign currency reflects the change in the value of receivables or accruals during the reporting period due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.       Capital Gains Incentive Fee       Pursuant to the terms of the investment
advisory and administrative services agreement, the incentive fee on capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee will equal 20.0% of our incentive fee
capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the
aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.   
  While the investment advisory and administrative services agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains
in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an AICPA Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related
accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to FSIC IV Advisor if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though FSIC IV Advisor is not entitled
to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.      Based on an
interpretation of the applicable language in the Advisers Act by the staff of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC, we  look through  our TRS in calculating the capital gains incentive fee. Under this  look through 
methodology, the portion of the net settlement payments received by us pursuant to the TRS which would have represented net investment income to us had we held the loans underlying the TRS directly is treated as net investment income subject to the
subordinated incentive fee on income payable to FSIC IV Advisor pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, rather than as realized capital gains in accordance with GAAP, and any unrealized depreciation on individual
loans underlying the TRS further reduces the capital gains incentive fee payable to FSIC IV Advisor with respect to realized gains. See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the TRS.
      Subordinated Income Incentive Fee       Pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC IV Advisor may also be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive fee on income. The subordinated incentive fee on income,
which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of our  pre-incentive fee net investment income  for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital,
equal to 1.875% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.5%. For purposes of this fee,  adjusted capital  means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of our common stock (including proceeds from our distribution
reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program. As a result, FSIC IV Advisor will not earn this part of the incentive fee for any quarter until our pre-incentive fee net investment income
for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Once our pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FSIC IV Advisor will be entitled to a  catch-up  fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee
net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.34375%, or 9.375% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FSIC IV Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of
pre-incentive fee net investment income.

    Organization Costs       Organization costs include, among other things, the cost of incorporating, including the cost of legal services and other fees pertaining to our organization. These costs are expensed as incurred as we
raise proceeds in our continuous public offering. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed $0 and $317, respectively, of organization costs as we raised proceeds in our continuous public offering. During the period
from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to December 31, 2015, we incurred organization costs of $317 which were paid on our behalf by FS Investments. See also   Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment Adviser
and Dealer Manager.        Offering Costs       Offering costs primarily include, among other things, marketing expenses and printing, legal and due diligence fees and other costs pertaining to our continuous public offering of shares of our common
stock, including the preparation of our Registration Statement on Form N-2 and salaries and direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor s personnel, employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in such activities. We will defer and amortize such
costs as an expense over twelve months as we raise proceeds in our continuous public offering. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed $286 and $517, respectively, of offering costs as we raised proceeds in our
continuous public offering, which commenced on January 6, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to December 31, 2015, we incurred offering costs of $2,017 and $3,403,
respectively, which were paid on our behalf by FS Investments. See also   Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager.    
  Under the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement, upon satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement,
FSIC IV Advisor became entitled to receive up to 0.75% of gross proceeds raised in our continuous public offering until all organization and offering costs funded by FSIC IV Advisor and its affiliates (including FS Investments) have been recovered.
      Uncertainty in Income Taxes       We evaluate our tax positions to determine if the tax positions taken meet the minimum recognition threshold in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be
taken for the purposes of measuring and recognizing tax benefits or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Recognition of a tax benefit or liability with respect to an uncertain tax position is required only when the position is
 more likely than not  to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax liabilities as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not incur any interest or penalties.       Contractual Obligations    
  We have entered into an agreement with FSIC IV Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for
investment advisory services under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets and (b) an incentive fee based on our
performance. FSIC IV Advisor, and, to the extent it provides such services, GDFM, are reimbursed for administrative expenses and/or organization and offering costs incurred on our behalf, as applicable. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated
financial statements included herein and   Related Party Transactions Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager  for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under this
agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices.
      Recently Issued Accounting Standards       None.       Related Party Transactions        Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager       Pursuant to the
investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC IV Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. We commenced accruing fees
under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement on January 6, 2016, upon commencement of our investment operations. We also reimburse FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM for expenses necessary to perform services related to our
administration and operations, including FSIC IV Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to us on behalf of FSIC IV Advisor. Pursuant to the
investment advisory and administrative services agreement, we also reimburse FSIC IV Advisor and its affiliates for expenses necessary to perform services related to our organization and continuous public offering.   
  Pursuant to the investment sub-advisory agreement, GDFM will receive 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FSIC IV Advisor
under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement with respect to each year.      FS Investments funded certain
of our organization and offering costs in the amounts of $2,017 and $3,720, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to December 31, 2015. Under the investment advisory
and administrative services agreement, there was no liability on our part for the organization or offering costs funded by FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliates (including FS Investments) until we satisfied the minimum offering requirement on January 6,
2016. Since commencing our continuous public offering and through September 30, 2016, we have paid total reimbursements of $834 to FSIC IV Advisor and its affiliates for organization and offering costs funded by them.   
  The dealer manager for our continuous public offering is FS Investment Solutions, which is one of our affiliates. Under the dealer
manager agreement, FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive upfront selling commissions in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in our continuous public offering, all or a portion of which may be re-allowed to selected
broker-dealers and financial representatives. The dealer-manager re-allowed the upfront sales commissions it was entitled to receive during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We will also be obligated to pay the dealer manager an annual
distribution fee which will accrue daily, beginning on February 27, 2017, and will be paid on a monthly basis. The dealer manager is entitled to re-allow all or a portion of the annual distribution fee to selected broker dealers and financial
representatives.

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $300 in base management fees were applied to offset the liability of FS Investments under the expense reimbursement
agreement (see   Overview Expense Reimbursement ) and $68 in net base management fees were paid to FSIC IV Advisor. As of September 30, 2016, $520 in base management fees were payable to FSIC IV Advisor.     

(2)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $800 based on the performance of our portfolio, of which $593 was based on
unrealized gains and $207 was based on realized gains. No capital gains incentive fees are actually payable by us with respect to unrealized gains unless and until those gains are actually realized. We did not pay any capital gains incentive fees to
FSIC IV Advisor during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See   Critical Accounting Policies Capital Gains Incentive Fees  for a discussion of the methodology employed by us in calculating the capital gains incentive fees.

(3)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $142 of the accrued administrative services expenses related to the allocation of costs of administrative personnel for
services rendered to us by FSIC IV Advisor and the remainder related to other reimbursable expenses. We paid $65 in administrative services expenses to FSIC IV Advisor during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     

(4)  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we expensed offering costs of $517, which related to reimbursements to FSIC IV Advisor for offering costs incurred on
our behalf, including marketing expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor s personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing our shares of common stock.

SEC, our expense reimbursement arrangement with FS Investments and FS Benefit Trust s purchases of our shares of Class T common stock.   
   Recent Developments    
  During the period from October 1, 2016 to November 1, 2016, we issued 1,040,183 shares of Class T common stock for gross proceeds of
$11,574 at an average price per share of $11.13.

Item 3.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.      

(in thousands)         We are
subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, 77.5% of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates, 21.5% paid fixed interest rates and the remainder (1.0%)
consisted of non-income producing equity or other investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any
fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent
that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on
income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to FSIC IV Advisor with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income.   
  Pursuant to the terms of the TRS between Cheltenham Funding and Citibank, Cheltenham Funding pays fees to Citibank at a floating rate
equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.60% or 1.50% per annum, as applicable, on the utilized notional amount of the loans subject to the TRS in exchange for the right to receive the economic benefit of a pool of loans having a maximum notional amount of
$125,000.      The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest
income, assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangement in effect as of September 30, 2016:   

(1)  
  Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. Includes the net effect of the change in interest rates on the unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on the TRS. Pursuant to the TRS, Cheltenham Funding receives from Citibank all interest payable in respect of the loans included in the TRS and pays to Citibank interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.60% per
annum on the utilized notional amount of the loans subject to the TRS. As of September 30, 2016, all of the loans underlying the TRS (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates.     
  We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate
risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from
changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not engage in interest rate hedging
activities.      In addition, we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation. See  Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Valuation of Portfolio Investments.

Item 4.   
   Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2016.      Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations.       Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting       During the third quarter of 2016, there was no change in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 31.1   
  CERTIFICATION     I, Michael C. Forman,
certify that:      

1. 
 I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of FS Investment Corporation IV;        

2. 
 Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;        

3. 
 Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;        

4. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:        

a. 
 Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;        

b. 
 Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;        

c. 
 Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of
the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and        

d. 
 Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter
in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and    

5. 
 The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the
registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):        

a. 
 All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
