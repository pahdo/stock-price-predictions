  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Achaogen, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiary, the "Company") is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company passionately committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel antibacterial drugs to treat multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. The Company is developing plazomicin, its lead product candidate, for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ("CRE"). The Company s Phase 3 study of plazomicin in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections ("cUTI") and acute pyelonephritis ("AP"), entitled EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI), is expected to serve as a single pivotal study supporting a new drug application ("NDA") for plazomicin in the United States. In addition, the Company's Phase 3 study of plazomicin, entitled CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae), which is a resistant pathogen-specific trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with certain infections due to CRE, is intended to provide important and meaningful supportive data to be submitted with the plazomicin NDA.   
  The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2002 and commenced operations in 2004. Since commencing operations in 2004, the Company has devoted substantially all of its resources to identifying and developing its product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company s annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial information. The results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  On June 3, 2016, the Company sold   7,999,996   shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase   1,999,999   shares of its common stock pursuant to Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") for aggregate gross proceeds of   $25.4 million   and aggregate net proceeds of   $25.1 million  , after deducting the issuance costs, in connection with a private placement financing transaction (the "Private Placement"). The warrants have an exercise price of   $3.66   per share and are exercisable up to   five   years from the date of issuance. 
  On April 7, 2015, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, declared effective by the SEC on April 21, 2015, covering the offering of up to   $150.0 million   of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and/or units. This Registration Statement included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to   $30.0 million   of shares of our common stock from time to time in an "at-the-market" ("ATM") equity offering pursuant to a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had sold   1,105,549   shares pursuant to its ATM equity offering program at a weighted-average price of   $4.82   per share for aggregate offering proceeds of   $5.3 million   and aggregate net proceeds of   $5.1 million  , after deducting the sales commissions and offering expenses.  
  In March 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering ( IPO ) of shares of its common stock, pursuant to which the Company issued   6,900,000   shares of common stock, which includes   900,000   shares issued pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to its underwriters, and received net proceeds of approximately   $73.9 million  , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. In connection with the completion of the Company s IPO, all  

Table of Contents  

shares of convertible preferred stock converted into   10,386,894   shares of common stock and all of the Company s convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock. 
  The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations every year since its inception.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately   $61.1 million     and an accumulated deficit of approximately     $217.5 million  .     Management expects to continue to incur additional substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of the Company's research and development activities, and the amounts of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held at September 30, 2016 are sufficient to fund our current planned operations at least through the beginning of the second quarter of 2017 without securing additional funding sources.  Management is currently evaluating different options for the raising of additional funds through equity or debt financing arrangements, government contracts and/or third party collaboration funding, however, there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available at terms acceptable to the Company or at all.  If the Company is unable to raise additional funding to meet its working capital needs, it will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of its research programs and/or limit or cease its operations. 
  The lack of financial resources to fund projected negative cash flows and the resultant need to raise substantial additional funding in the near term in order to sustain operations raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Use of Estimates 
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to clinical trial accruals, fair value of liabilities, common stock and stock-based awards and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, contracts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. Based upon the borrowing rates (which is a Level 2 input) currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the Company believes the carrying amount of the loan payable approximates its fair value. The warrant and derivative liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value recorded in the Company's statements of operations. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits, cash, commercial paper and investments in money market funds. 
  Short-term Investments 
  Short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturities greater than three months, but less than one year from the date of acquisition, and are classified as available for sale. Short-term investments are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The amortized cost of debt  

Table of Contents  

securities reflects amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts to date, which are included in interest income. 
  The Company reviews all of its marketable securities on a regular basis to evaluate whether any security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. 
  Restricted Cash 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had restricted cash of   $377,000   and   $127,000  . The restricted cash, which consists of money market accounts with one of the Company s financial institutions, serves as collateral for the letters of credit provided as security deposits under the Company s facility leases. As of September 30, 2016,   $127,000   of restricted cash is classified as current assets and relates to the current facility lease that expires on   April 14, 2017  .  
  Warrant Liability 
  On June 3, 2016, the Company issued warrants to purchase   1,999,999   shares of its common stock in connection with the Private Placement. Each warrant has an exercise price of   $3.66   per share and is exercisable for   five   years from the date of issuance. The Company accounts for these warrants as a liability instrument measured at estimated fair value. The initial fair value of the warrants was determined using a calibration model that involved using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model ("Black-Scholes"), which requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected share price volatility, underlying price per share of the Company's common stock and remaining term of the warrants. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, using Black-Scholes, with any changes in the fair value of the outstanding warrants recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Segment Reporting 
  Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company has   one   operating segment. 
  Customer Concentration 
  For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s revenue had been generated solely from funding pursuant to U.S. government contracts, and accordingly all contracts receivable relate to funding from U.S. government contracts. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in checking and money market accounts at one financial institution with balances that generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the financial institution is financially sound, and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to this financial institution. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies and institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents or issuing the debt securities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had not experienced any credit losses in such accounts or investments. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company recognizes revenue when: (i) evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) fees are fixed or determinable, (iii) services have been delivered, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company currently generates revenue entirely from government contracts. Government contracts are agreements that provide the Company with payments for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually-defined period. Revenue from government contracts is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred and the related services are rendered, provided that the applicable conditions under the government contracts have been met.  Costs of contract revenue are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. 
  Funds received from third parties under contract arrangements are recorded as revenue if the Company is deemed to be the principal participant in the contract arrangements because the activities under the contracts are part of the Company s development programs. If the Company is not the principal participant, the funds from contracts are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense. Contract funds received are not refundable and are recognized when the related qualified  

Table of Contents  

research and development costs are incurred and when there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be received. Funds billed and received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. 
  Research and Development Costs 
  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses; laboratory supplies; consulting costs; external contract research and development expenses; and allocated overhead, including rent, equipment depreciation and utilities, and relate to both Company-sponsored programs as well as costs incurred pursuant to collaboration agreements and government contracts.  
  The Company estimates preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on its behalf. In accruing service fees, the Company estimates the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, the Company will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the receipt of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered. 
  Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and other current assets and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   (Topic 205-40),   Going Concern  . This ASU introduces an explicit requirement for management to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management must assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date. Disclosures are required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes   (Topic 740)   - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . This guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes in a classified balance sheet to require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent and is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is applicable to the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate it will have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases,   which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. This ASU will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging   (Topic 815) -   Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.    This ASU clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts.  An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence.  This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are effective, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently assessing the potential effects of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   (Topic 718) -   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)  ,   which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)  , Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers by one year the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim periods within those periods). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606),   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which clarifies how to identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation and how to apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606),   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)  , Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   which addresses certain issues on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. These ASUs will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company has not selected a transition method and is currently assessing the potential effects of this ASU on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Net Loss Per Share 
  Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. For purposes of this calculation, preferred stock, stock options, restricted stock units and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. 
  For the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, all potentially dilutive securities outstanding have been excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding because such securities have an antidilutive impact due to losses reported. Below are listed the potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2016 have a weighted-average exercise price of   $3.78  . 
   
  3. Fair Value Measurements 
  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. The carrying amount of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, contracts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows: 
  Level 1  : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2  : Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3  : Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company s Level 2 valuations of marketable securities are generally derived from independent pricing services based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, with prices adjusted for yield and number of days to maturity, or based on industry models using data inputs, such as interest rates and prices that can be directly observed or corroborated in active markets. 
  In certain cases, where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 liabilities that are measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis consist of a derivative liability in connection with loan payable and a warrant liability in connection with the Private Placement. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31 2015, financial assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis and classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as described above were as follows (in thousands):

All available-for-sale securities held as of September 30, 2016 had maturities less than one year from the date of acquisition. There were no sales of available-for-sale securities in any of the periods presented. The carrying value of corporate debt obligations that were in unrealized loss positions totaled   $13.3 million   as of September 30, 2016. The Company has determined that (i) it does not have the intent to sell any of these investments, and (ii) it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such corporate debt obligations and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016. 
  Pursuant to the loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. (see Note 7), the Company entered into a Success Fee Agreement under which the Company agreed to pay   $1.0 million   in cash (the "Success Fee") if the Company obtains approval to market plazomicin from the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"). If such approval is obtained, the Success Fee shall be due the later of (i) August 5, 2019 or (ii) the date such FDA approval is obtained. The fair value of the Success Fee, approximately   $375,000   at December 31, 2015, is recorded as a derivative liability and included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability as of September 30, 2016 increased by   $38,000   to   $413,000   from December 31, 2015, as a result of the time value of money, which is presented as change in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.  
  The fair value of the derivative liability was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, and is classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy since the Company s valuation utilized significant unobservable inputs. Specifically, the key assumptions included in the calculation of the estimated fair value of the derivative instrument include: i) the Company s estimates of both the probability and timing of a potential   $1.0 million   payment to Solar Capital Ltd. upon FDA approval to market plazomicin, and ii) a discount rate of   13%   which was derived from the Company's estimated cost of debt. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability is most sensitive to the probability of FDA approval. Should the probability of FDA approval change by   5%  , the fair value of the derivative liability as of September 30, 2016 would change by approximately   $32,000  . For the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, there was no change to the key assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated fair value. Any changes in the estimated fair values are presented as changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Pursuant to the Private Placement (see Note 2), the Company issued warrants to purchase   1,999,999   shares of common stock at an exercise price of   $3.66  . The Company classified these warrants as a liability measured at fair value using Black-

Scholes. Under certain entity conditions, the holder of a warrant may require the Company to settle the warrant in cash at its estimated fair value using Black-Scholes. On the closing date of the Private Placement, June 3, 2016, the   $2.6 million   initial estimated fair value of the warrants was recorded as a warrant liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the warrants was approximately   $5.4 million  . The change in the estimated fair value is primarily due to the increase in the Company's stock price and is included in changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  The fair value of the warrant liability is classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy since the Company s valuation utilized significant unobservable inputs, including the risk-free interest rate, expected share price volatility, underlying price per share of the Company's common stock and remaining term of the warrants. The estimated fair values of the warrants were determined using Black-Scholes with the following assumptions, during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016: 

The expected volatility is based on the Company's expected volatility. The expected term is based on the remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is obtained from the yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities for a period equal to the expected term of the warrants. The dividend yield is   zero   because the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. Should the share price change by   5%  , the fair value of the warrant liability as of September 30, 2016 would change by approximately   $394,000  . 
  Changes in the fair value of recurring measurements included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are presented as changes in warrant and derivative liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations and were as follows for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

  Ionis Pharmaceuticals 
  In January 2006, the Company entered into a license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Ionis ). Ionis granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide license with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses related to the research and development of aminoglycoside products. As an up-front fee, the Company issued   97,402   shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a fair value of   $15.40   per share. This license fee of   $1,500,000   was recorded as research and development expense in 2006. In further consideration of this license, and in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to make milestone payments with respect to development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, and to pay a percentage of revenue received from sublicensees (if any). All such milestone and sublicense revenue payments may total, in the aggregate, up to but no more than   $19,500,000   for the first product and   $9,750,000   following the second product commercialized under the agreement with Ionis.

  7. Borrowings 
  Solar Capital Ltd. Loan Agreement 
  On August 5, 2015, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Solar Capital Ltd. (the  Lender ) pursuant to which the Lender agreed to make available to the Company term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $25.0 million   with a maturity date of August 5, 2019. An initial   $15.0 million   term loan was funded at closing on August 5, 2015, and a second   $10.0 million   term loan was funded on June 20, 2016. Borrowings under the term loans bear interest per annum at   6.99%   plus the greater of   1%   or the one-month LIBOR. The Company is currently required to make interest-only payments on the term loans through August 2017, and beginning on September 1, 2017 the Company is required to make monthly payments of interest plus equal monthly payments of principal over a term of   24   months. The Loan Agreement requires collateral by a security interest in all of the Company s assets except intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge) and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, and also includes standard events of default, including payment defaults. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional   4%   may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the Lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. There were no financial covenants attached to the loan. The Loan Agreement included a closing fee of   $250,000   which was paid at closing, and the Company is obligated to pay a fee equal to   8%   of the term loans funded upon the earliest to occur of the maturity date, the acceleration of the term loans or the voluntary prepayment of the term loans. The cost of these fees is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective-interest method. The Company may voluntarily prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding term loans. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary events of default that entitle the Lender to cause the Company s indebtedness under the Loan Agreement to become immediately due and payable.  
  On August 5, 2015, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a Success Fee Agreement with the Lender under which the Company agreed to pay the Lender   $1.0 million   if the Company obtains FDA approval to market plazomicin. If such approval is obtained, the Success Fee shall be due the later of (i) August 5, 2019 or (ii) the date such FDA approval is obtained. The fair value of the Success Fee at the date of issuance of approximately   $356,000   was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective-interest method.

The warrants have an exercise price of   $3.66   and are exercisable up to   five   years from the date of issuance. The Company's Chief Operating Officer, a related party, participated in the Private Placement by purchasing   141,453   shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase   35,363   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $0.5 million  . Issuance costs of   $0.3 million   were offset against equity as a reduction from gross proceeds. 
  At the close of the Private Placement, the estimated fair values of the common stock and warrants issued were   $22.9 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively. At September 30, 2016, using Black-Scholes, the Company estimated the fair value of the warrant liability to be   $5.4 million   and recorded a charge of   $1.5 million   and   $2.8 million  , for the increase in the liability, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  Equity Incentive Plans 
  2014 Plan 
  In February 2014, the Company s stockholders approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "2014 Plan"), which became effective as of March 11, 2014. Under the 2014 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options ("ISOs"), nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and other stock-based awards for the purchase of that number of shares of common stock. Effective, January 1, 2016, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an evergreen increase of   735,808   shares that may be granted in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan. As of September 30, 2016,   626,991   shares were available for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.  

Table of Contents  

Under the 2014 Plan, the terms of stock award agreements, including vesting requirements, are determined by the board of directors, subject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. Options granted by the Company typically vest over a   four   year period and the exercise price may not be less than fair market value on the date of grant. Certain of the options are subject to acceleration of vesting in the event of certain change of control transactions. Options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than   10 years   from the date of grant. 
  2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan 
  In December 2014, the Company adopted a 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (the "Inducement Plan"). The Inducement Plan is designed to comply with the inducement exemption contained in Nasdaq s Rule 5635(c)(4), which provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, RSUs, restricted stock awards, performance awards, dividend equivalents, deferred stock awards, deferred stock units, stock payment and stock appreciation rights to a person not previously an employee or director of the Company, or following a bona fide period of non-employment, as an inducement material to the individual s entering into employment with the Company.  As of September 30, 2016, a total of   1,150,000   shares of common stock have been authorized under the Inducement Plan, including the additional   500,000   shares that became available resulting from an amendment adopted by the board of directors as of March 17, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016,   197,592   shares were available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan. 
  2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  In February 2014, the Company s stockholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ), which became effective as of March 11, 2014. Effective, January 1, 2016, the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an evergreen increase of   183,952   shares that may be granted in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. As of September 30, 2016,   141,527   shares of common stock have been issued to employees participating in the ESPP, and   366,950   shares are available for issuance under the ESPP.  
  Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Plan 
  The Company s Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan"), provided for the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants at the discretion of the board of directors. The Company granted options under its 2003 Plan until January 2014 and it was terminated as to future awards in March 2014, although it continues to govern the terms of options that remain outstanding under the 2003 Plan. 
  Options granted under the 2003 Plan expire no later than   10 years   from the date of grant. Options granted under the 2003 Plan vest over periods determined by the board of directors, generally over   four years  .  
  The 2003 Plan allows for early exercise of certain options prior to vesting. Upon termination of employment, the unvested shares are subject to repurchase at the original exercise price. Stock options granted or modified after March 21, 2002, that are subsequently exercised for cash prior to vesting, are not deemed to be issued until those shares vest. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 there were   no   shares subject to repurchase relating to the early exercise of options. 
  In connection with the board of directors and stockholders approval of the 2014 Plan, all remaining shares available for future awards under the 2003 Plan were transferred to the 2014 Plan, and the 2003 Plan was terminated as to future awards. As of September 30, 2016, a total of   889,755   shares of common stock are subject to options outstanding under the 2003 plan, which shares will become available under the 2014 Plan to the extent the options are forfeited or lapse unexercised.

The following table summarizes stock option activity under the stock plans, excluding the ESPP, and related information:    

Stock-based compensation expense recognized for stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations was as follows (in thousands):  

As of September 30, 2016, approximately   $6,979,000   of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.87 years  . 
  The estimated grant date fair value of employee stock options with time-based vesting terms was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, based on the following assumptions:  

Stock Options Granted to Non-Employees 
  During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted to a non-employee an option to purchase   15,000   shares of common stock. The Company did not grant stock options to non-employees during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The Company recorded non-employees stock-based compensation expense of approximately   $6,000   and   zero   for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $6,000   and   zero   for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company measures the estimated fair value of the award for each period until the award is fully vested. The fair value of options granted to non-employees during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 was estimated using Black-Scholes with the following assumptions:

Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees 
  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted RSUs to employees to receive   324,650   shares of common stock under the Company's stock plans with a weighted-average estimated grant-date fair value of   $3.86   per share. RSUs generally vest annually over a   4  -year service period and vesting is contingent on continued service. As of September 30, 2016, there were unrecognized compensation costs of   $2,877,000   related to outstanding RSUs, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.92 years  . 
  A summary of RSU activity is as follows: 

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees that Contain Performance Conditions 
  During the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of   129,000   and   340,250   shares of common stock and   6,750   and   56,925   RSUs that vest upon the achievement of market-based common stock price targets. The fair values of these options and RSUs were estimated at the grant date using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The Monte-Carlo simulation model requires the use of a range of assumptions. The risk-free interest rate range was   1.37%   to   1.76%  , expected volatility rate was   70%   and the dividend rate was   0%  . The expected life assumption is not used in Monte-Carlo simulation model, but the output of the model indicated an expected time to vest of   2.5   to   6.0   years. The associated stock-based compensation expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the implicit service period (expected time to vest) derived from that simulation model. The Company did not issue any performance based options to purchase common stock, or RSUs during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015. 
   
  9. Commitments 
  Nonrefundable advance payments 
  In July 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with its pharmaceutical contract manufacturing organization that obligates it to make a total of   $1.5 million   of nonrefundable advance payments for the reservation of facilities and resources, plus procurement of long-lead raw materials, to produce plazomicin for regulatory commercial validation.  Such advance payments are initially capitalized as prepaid and other current assets and are being recognized as research and development expenses as goods are delivered and services are performed.  The Company assesses such prepaid and other current assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or may not provide future economic benefits. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had recorded   $0.8 million   as prepaid and other current assets related to this agreement.  Through September 30, 2016, the Company has recognized   $0.7 million   as research and development expenses. 
  Facilities Lease Obligation 

Table of Contents  

The Company leases its principal executive offices in South San Francisco under a non-cancelable lease agreement that expires on April 14, 2017. In August 2016, the Company entered into a non-cancelable agreement (the "Lease") to lease approximately   47,000   square feet of office, laboratory and research and development space for the Company's new principal executive offices. The Lease is set to commence in March 2017, after the substantial completion of certain improvements ("Tenant Improvements") required under the Lease, and set to expire in August 2027 ("Lease Term"). The Lease contains expansion options and an option to extend the Lease Term for an additional   5 years  . Base rent for the first year of the Lease Term is approximately   $2.7 million  , with an increase in annual base rent of approximately   3.5%   in each subsequent year of the Lease Term. The Lease also provides for rent abatement of approximately   $1.8 million   for the first year of the Lease Term.  
  The Company is entitled to a one-time improvement allowance of   $5.7 million   for the Tenant Improvements (the "Allowance"). The Landlord disburses the Allowance for the Tenant Improvement on behalf of the Company. In the event that the Company withdraws from the Lease prior to the commencement of the Lease, the Company will be required to reimburse the Landlord for expenditures incurred related to the Tenant Improvements. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded approximately   $107,000   within construction-in-progress under property, plant and equipment, net and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to costs incurred under the Allowance. At its election, the Company is also entitled to an additional improvements allowance of   $0.9 million   ("Additional Allowance"). In the event the Company elects to use the Additional Allowance, the base rent will be increased as calculated in the Lease. Further, the Company had a deposit of   $250,000   included in long-term restricted cash as of September 30, 2016, restricted from withdrawal and held in a money market account with one of the Company s financial institutions in the form of collateral for a letter of credit held as security for the Lease. 
  Future minimum lease payments under the operating leases as of September 30, 2016 are as follows (in thousands): 

The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease period. Rent expense was   $145,000   and   $150,000   for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $435,000   and   $381,000   for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  Overview 
  We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company passionately committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel antibacterials to treat multi-drug resistant ("MDR") gram-negative infections. We are developing plazomicin, our lead product candidate, for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ( CRE ). In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified CRE as  nightmare bacteria  and an immediate public health threat that requires  urgent and aggressive action.  
  Our development plan for plazomicin includes two Phase 3 clinical trials. The first study, a Phase 3 trial of plazomicin for the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract infections ( cUTI ) and acute pyelonephritis ( AP ), entitled EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI), is expected to serve as a single pivotal study supporting a new drug application ( NDA ) for plazomicin in the United States. The Phase 3 EPIC trial is a randomized, double blind, active controlled study in patients with cUTI and AP and allows broad enrollment of patients with gram-negative infections.  We have reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") that this non-inferiority trial comparing plazomicin to meropenem with a 15% non-inferiority margin and a corresponding sample size of approximately 530 patients, is acceptable.  The first patient was enrolled in the Phase 3 EPIC trial in January 2016 and enrollment was closed in August 2016 with 609 patients.  We expect top-line results for our Phase 3 EPIC trial by the end of 2016 and expect to submit an NDA for plazomicin in the second half of 2017, with a planned commercial launch of plazomicin in the U.S. in 2018, if our NDA is approved. We also plan to submit a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for plazomicin in 2018. 
  The Phase 3 EPIC trial enrolled a broad range of patients with cUTI or AP, including patients with infections due to MDR gram-negative pathogens. If successful, this study will provide clinical evidence of non-inferiority to meropenem, a carbapenem antibiotic considered to be a last line of defense in patients with serious infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, including fluoroquinolone resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase ("ESBL") producing isolates. We believe that favorable efficacy data from this trial will provide the basis for FDA approval and will permit plazomicin to be used as a treatment for MDR gram-negative pathogens, including CRE and ESBL-producing pathogens. This study will also provide important safety data regarding plazomicin in patients with various co-morbidities, including those with varying degrees of renal function. 
  The second ongoing study, our Phase 3 CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) trial is a resistant pathogen-specific trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with infections due to CRE. We believe our Phase 3 CARE trial will provide important data about plazomicin's potential in treating patients with CRE infections, where there are limited treatment options currently available.  The Phase 3 CARE trial is funded in part with a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA"), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
  We ended enrollment in the CARE study in August 2016 and expect to announce top-line data results from our Phase 3 CARE study by the end of 2016. We plan to submit the Phase 3 CARE study results as supportive data with the plazomicin NDA based on our Phase 3 EPIC trial and to submit the results to a peer-reviewed journal and for presentation at a medical meeting in 2017.  Based on physician market research, we believe the Phase 3 CARE study will provide important and

meaningful data regarding the efficacy, safety, microbiology, and dosing, as well as important health economic data, to better inform use of plazomicin in the treatment of patients with CRE infections. 
  In 2012, the FDA granted fast track designation for the development and regulatory review of plazomicin to treat serious and life-threatening CRE infections. In 2014, plazomicin received Qualified Infectious Disease Product ("QIDP") designation from the FDA. The QIDP designation was created by the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now ("GAIN") Act, which was part of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act and provides certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and an additional five years of market exclusivity.  Our plazomicin program is funded in part with a contract from BARDA for up to   $123.8 million  . We have global commercialization rights to plazomicin, which has patent protection in the United States extending through 2031. Plazomicin is the first clinical candidate from our gram-negative antibiotic discovery engine, and we have other programs in early and late preclinical stages focused on other MDR gram-negative infections. 
  Since commencing operations in 2004, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to identifying and developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these functions. In addition to plazomicin, our research team is focused on discovering medicines with novel mechanisms of action for serious infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, including MDR   Pseudomonas aeruginosa   and MDR   Acinetobacter baumannii.   We are taking a multifaceted approach to identify new antibacterial agents through our research. In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Crystal Biosciences, Inc. to identify and generate therapeutic antibodies against multiple novel targets. Our goal is to file an investigational new drug application ( IND ) from our research programs in 2017. 
  Since our inception, we have financed our operations with the proceeds of our initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock, proceeds from sales of our common stock through our at-the-market ("ATM") equity offering program, funding under our contracts with government agencies, private placements of our equity securities and certain debt-related financing arrangements. Currently, our plazomicin program is funded in part with a contract from BARDA. Our other programs are currently funded primarily with company funds, although we also received a contract for $4.4 million in 2015 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ("NIAID"), with additional funding of up to $0.6 million available if all options are exercised. Historically, our preclinical programs have received funding support from organizations in addition to the NIH and NIAID, such as the U.S. Department of Defense and The Wellcome Trust, a global charitable foundation. We intend to continue to seek further collaborations with government agencies, non-profit foundations, and other research and development funding organizations to support our discovery efforts and advance the product candidates in our pipeline. 
  On March 17, 2014, we completed our IPO of common stock. We sold 6,900,000 shares of our common stock, which included 900,000 shares issued as a result of the underwriters exercising their over-allotment option in full. We received cash proceeds of approximately $73.9 million from the IPO, net of underwriting commissions and related expenses. 
  On April 7, 2015, we entered into the Sales Agreement (the  Sales Agreement ) with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $30.0 million from time to time through an ATM equity offering program under which Cowen acts as sales agent. As of September 30, 2016, we had sold   1,105,549   shares under the Sales Agreement at an average price of   $4.82   per share and we received aggregate cash proceeds of   $5.1 million  , after deducting the sales commissions and offering expenses. 
  On August 5, 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd., pursuant to which Solar Capital Ltd. agreed to make available to us term loans with an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, $15.0 million of which was provided to us on August 5, 2015 and   $10.0 million   of which was provided to us on June 20, 2016. 
  On May 26, 2016, BARDA exercised an additional option ("Option 3") under its existing contract, and we were awarded an additional   $20.0 million   in contract funding. Option 3 also includes a no-cost extension of the period of performance for Option 1 to September 20, 2016, under the contract to support our Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin. The funding from Option 3 is focused on the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of plazomicin, the EPIC study, in cUTI. This brings the total committed funding under the contract to   $123.8 million  . 
  On June 3, 2016, we sold   7,999,996   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase   1,999,999   shares of common stock pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement ( Purchase Agreement ) for aggregate gross proceeds of   $25.4 million   and aggregate net proceeds of   $25.1 million  , after deducting the issuance costs, in a private placement financing transaction (the "Private Placement"). The warrants have an exercise price of   $3.66   and are exercisable up to five years from the date of issuance. 
  We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since the commencement of our operations. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and associated general and administrative costs. We expect to incur substantial losses from operations in the foreseeable future

as we advance plazomicin and other product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval, and prepare for, if approved, commercialization. Management believes that, based on its current operating plans, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with the committed funds from the BARDA contract, are estimated to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements to fund our current planned operations at least through the beginning of the second quarter of 2017.  Still, we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.  See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  and Note 1 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and to our consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional information describing the circumstances that lead to the inclusion of this explanatory paragraph. 
  Financial Overview 
  Contract Revenue 
  We have derived all of our revenue to date from funding provided under U.S. government contracts in connection with the development of our product candidates. Our product candidates are still in clinical and preclinical development and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Other than this contract revenue from government funding, we do not expect to derive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products, which we do not expect will occur before 2018, if at all, or until such time that we potentially enter into collaboration agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of such product candidates. 
  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)  . We have received funding for our lead product candidate, plazomicin, under a contract with BARDA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical evaluation of, and regulatory filings for, plazomicin as a countermeasure for disease caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biothreats. Our BARDA contract provides for payments to us based on direct costs incurred and allowances for overhead, plus a fee, where applicable. The total committed funding under our BARDA contract is   $123.8 million  , including   $20.0 million   for Option 3, exercised by BARDA on May 26, 2016. The exercised option relates to the support of our Phase 3 EPIC study and the preparation and submission of a NDA to the FDA. 
  For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total revenue recognized under the BARDA contract was   $15.4 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively, and   $29.2 million   and   $13.5 million  , respectively, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Through September 30, 2016, a total of   $106.3 million   under the BARDA contract was recorded as revenue, with   $17.5 million   remaining available from the funding currently committed under the contract. 
  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).    In July 2014, the Company was awarded a one-year, $407,000 grant by NIAID to conduct discovery research on novel antibiotics targeting gram-negative bacteria. The contract was subsequently modified to extend through July 31, 2016. 
    
  In July 2015, the Company was awarded a contract by NIAID for $1.5 million committed through September 30, 2016, with total funding of up to $4.5 million available if all options are exercised under the contract.  In January 2016, an additional committed funding of $0.5 million was added to the awarded funding and the total potential funding was increased to $5.0 million.  In April 2016, NIAID modified the contract to exercise an option which increased the total contract committed funding to $4.4 million through February 2018, with total potential funding remaining at $5.0 million if the remaining option is exercised. 
    
  For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total revenue recognized under the NIAID contracts was   $615,000   and   $693,000  , respectively, and   $1,828,000   and   $775,000  , respectively, for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
  Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)  . In November 2012, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA ), a division of the U.S. Department of Defense, terminated for convenience a contract with us to develop novel antibacterials for the treatment of biodefense pathogens. In connection with the termination, we sought payment for additional expenses we had incurred. Effective April 30, 2015, we reached a settlement of our claim with DTRA. The net settlement of   $7.1 million  , together with sums previously received, constitutes complete and final settlement of the contract.

Research and Development Expenses 
  Research and development ("R D") expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research, discovery and preclinical studies of potential new drug compounds, plus product development efforts related to clinical trials and materials manufacturing processes. R D costs are expensed as incurred and include the following:    
             
    expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical activities; 
                
    employee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and consulting fees; 
                
    third-party supplier expenses including the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial and other materials; and 
                
    facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, amortization or depreciation of leasehold improvements, equipment and laboratory supplies and other expenses. 
     Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.  
  We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for the foreseeable future related to our R D activities as we continue research programs and the development of our product candidates. Further, we have incurred substantial research and development costs associated with our plazomicin program as our Phase 3 EPIC and CARE trials have completed patient enrollment. We expect to continue to incur substantial R D expenses in the future as we continue to support plazomicin development, including preparations to submit an NDA for plazomicin to the FDA.  
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in R D. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in future periods, reflecting an expanding infrastructure in preparation for commercialization of plazomicin, if approved. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
  Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we adopted the accounting policy related to the warrant liabilities as discussed below, in addition to the critical accounting policies described under   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Warrant Liability 
  In June 2016, we issued warrants to purchase 2.0 million shares of common stock in connection with the Private Placement. The fair value of the warrants is classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the warrants contain certain material terms which require us to settle the warrants, in a case of certain change of control transactions, for cash equal to the estimated fair value, determined by the Black-Scholes Pricing Model ( Black Scholes ).  
  The initial fair value of the warrants was determined using a calibration model that involved using Black-Scholes, which requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected share price volatility, underlying price per share of our  

Table of Contents  

common stock and remaining term of the warrants. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, using Black-Scholes, with any changes in the fair value of the outstanding warrants included in  change in warrant and derivative liabilities  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Comparison of the Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Contract Revenue 
  Contract revenue in each period related solely to funding pursuant to our government contracts. Contract revenue increased   $11.5 million   to   $16.0 million   in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $4.5 million   in the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development services performed under our BARDA contract.  
  Research and Development Expenses 
  R D expenses increased   $10.5 million   to   $20.5 million   in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $10.0 million   in the comparable period in 2015. This was primarily due to increases of $7.5 million in the external expenses related to our plazomicin program, mainly attributable to the Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin, $1.0 million in consulting and non-clinical costs for research programs other than plazomicin and $2.1 million in personnel and overhead related costs as headcount increased in our research and development organization since 2015. 
  We record R D expenses by program where directly identifiable. In the table below, we have allocated indirect R D costs based on time charged directly to programs by R D employees. Indirect R D costs include employee benefit expenses, employee time not charged directly to a program, laboratory supplies and expenses, and allocated facility expenses. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $1.5 million   to   $4.5 million   for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $3.0 million   for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $0.8 million in personnel and facility related costs and an increase of $0.7 million in costs supporting the development, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of plazomicin. 

Table of Contents  

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense increased   $0.4 million   to   $0.7 million   for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $0.3 million   for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was a result of an additional $10.0 million of borrowings under the Solar Capital loan agreement in June 2016. 
  Change in Warrant and Derivative Liabilities 
  Change in warrant and derivative liabilities increased   $1.5 million   for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   zero   for the comparable period in 2015. The increase is primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability, which increased mainly due to the change in our stock price. 
  Comparison of the Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Contract Revenue 
  Contract revenue in each period related solely to funding pursuant to our government contracts. Contract revenue increased   $9.6 million   to   $31.0 million   in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $21.4 million   in the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development services performed under our BARDA and NIAID contracts. 
  Research and Development Expenses 
  R D expenses increased   $28.1 million   to   $56.1 million   in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $28.0 million   in the comparable period in 2015. This was primarily due to increases of $19.2 million in the external expenses related to our plazomicin program, mainly attributable to the Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin, $3.9 million in consulting and non-clinical costs for research programs other than plazomicin, including a signing fee under a collaboration and license agreement for our early research program, and $5.0 million in personnel and overhead related costs as headcount increased in our research and development organization since 2015. 
  We record R D expenses by program where directly identifiable. In the table below, we have allocated indirect R D costs based on time charged directly to programs by R D employees. Indirect R D costs include employee benefit expenses, employee time not charged directly to a program, laboratory supplies and expenses, and allocated facility expenses.

General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $3.1 million   to   $12.2 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $9.1 million   for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.5 million in personnel and facility related costs, an increase of $0.9 million in consulting and professional fees, and an increase of $0.7 million in costs supporting the development, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of plazomicin 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense increased   $1.3 million   to   $1.6 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   $0.3 million   for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was the result of $15.0 million of borrowings in August 2015 and an additional $10.0 million of borrowings in June 2016, under the Solar Capital loan agreement. 
  Change in Warrant and Derivative Liabilities 
  Change in warrant and derivative liabilities increased   $2.9 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from   zero   for the comparable period in 2015. The increase is primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability, which increased mainly due to the change in our stock price. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $35.0 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to the research and development of our product candidates. Our net loss from operations in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 of   $41.5 million   was partially offset by non-cash charges of   $2.9 million   for the revaluation of the warrant and derivative liabilities,   $0.3 million   for depreciation and amortization,   $0.3 million   for amortization of premium on short-term investments,   $0.5 million   for non-cash interest expense,   $2.7 million   for stock-based compensation, and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of   $0.2 million  . The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in contract receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets, as a result of costs for our ongoing Phase 3 EPIC trial and the timing of our payments. 
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $9.6 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to the research and development of our product candidates. Our net loss from operations in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 of   $15.8 million   was partially offset by non-cash charges of $0.3 million for depreciation and amortization, $0.3 million for amortization of premium on short-term investments and $2.3 million for stock-based compensation and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of $3.1 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities of $3.1 million was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of costs related to preparing for our Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin and the timing of our payments. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $18.2 million   and   $8.7 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The net cash provided by investing activities during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is primarily a result of maturities in excess of purchases of short-term investments of   $18.9 million   and   $9.1  

Table of Contents  

million  , respectively.  Other uses of cash in both periods resulted from purchases of property, plant and equipment to facilitate our increased R D activities. 
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $38.3 million   and   $17.1 million   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 includes $25.1 million for the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock from the Private Placement,   $10.0 million   from the term loan provided by Solar Capital Ltd. in June 2016, $3.0 million through "at the market" offerings in which Cowen and Company, LLC acted as sales agent, and   $0.2 million   from issuance of common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans. The net cash provided by financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 were from net proceeds from borrowings of $14.6 million, the issuance of common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans of $1.2 million and the sale of our common stock of $1.3 million through "at the market" offerings in which Cowen and Company, LLC acted as sales agent. 
  Plan of Operations and Future Funding Requirements 
  We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for research, development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Specifically, we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our clinical development of plazomicin. Management believes that, based on its current operating plans, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with the committed funds from the BARDA contract, are estimated to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements to fund our current planned operations at least through the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. 
  On August 5, 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd., pursuant to which Solar Capital Ltd. agreed to make available to us term loans with an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, $15.0 million of which was provided to us on August 5, 2015 and   $10.0 million   of which was provided to us on June 20, 2016. In addition, we are permitted to make interest-only payments through August 2017, followed by 24 equal monthly payments of principal plus interest through the scheduled maturity date of August 2019. 
  On April 7, 2015, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-203282), declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on April 21, 2015 (the "Shelf Registration Statement"), covering the offering of up to $150 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and units. The Shelf Registration Statement included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $30.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time in "at the market" offerings pursuant to a Common Stock Sales Agreement entered into with Cowen and Company, LLC (the "Sales Agreement") on April 7, 2015. Through September 2016, we sold   1,105,549   shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement, at a weighted-average price of approximately   $4.82   per share for aggregate gross proceeds of   $5.3 million   and net proceeds of   $5.1 million  , after deducting the sales commissions and offering expenses. As of September 30, 2016, approximately   $144.7 million   in securities remained unissued under the Shelf Registration Statement, including up to   $24.7 million   of common stock available to be sold under the Sales Agreement, subject to certain conditions specified therein. 
  On May 26, 2016, we were awarded an additional   $20.0 million   from Option 3 of the BARDA Contract to support the Phase 3 EPIC trial of plazomicin, which includes a no-cost extension of the period of performance for Option 1 to September 20, 2016. 
  On June 3, 2016, we closed a Private Placement and received aggregate gross proceeds of   $25.4 million   and aggregate net proceeds of   $25.1 million  , after deducting the issuance costs, from the sale of   7,999,996   shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase   1,999,999   shares of its common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of   $3.66   and are exercisable up to five years from the date of issuance. 
  We do not expect that our current capital resources will be sufficient to enable us to seek marketing approval for plazomicin or commercially launch plazomicin. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including for obtaining marketing approval for plazomicin. We may obtain additional financing through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, a credit facility, government contracts and/or strategic collaborations. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to obtain debt financing may be limited by covenants we have made under our loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. and our pledge to Solar Capital Ltd. of substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property, as collateral. The negative pledge in favor of Solar Capital Ltd. with respect to our intellectual property under the loan and security agreement could further limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to raise

capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. The amount and timing of our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, including:  
              
    the size, timing and type of the nonclinical and clinical studies that we decide to pursue in the development of our product candidates, including plazomicin; 
                 
    the type, number, costs and results of the product candidate development programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; 
                 
    the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities; 
                
    the costs associated with developing a plazomicin IVD assay to support therapeutic drug monitoring; 
                 
    the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, including the preparation of a NDA for plazomicin, and any supplemental applications thereto; 
                 
    our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; 
                 
    the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;  
                
    the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; 
                 
    the resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates; 
                 
    the scope, progress, expansion, and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; 
                 
    our ability to enter into additional government contracts, or other collaborative agreements, to support the development of our product candidates and development efforts; and 
                 
    the costs associated with being a public company.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    Risk Factors. 

Risks Related to Our Business and Capital Requirements  
  We have a limited operating history, have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.  
  We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products and have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations in 2004. All of our product candidates are in development, and none has been approved for sale. In the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we derived all of our revenue from government contracts for research and development. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $27.1 million and $20.2 million, respectively. Our net losses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $41.5 million   and   $15.8 million  , respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of   $217.5 million  .  
  We expect to continue incurring significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our Phase 3 EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI) trial of our lead product candidate, plazomicin, in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections ("cUTI"), our Phase 3 CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) trial of plazomicin in the treatment of infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ("CRE"), seek marketing approval for plazomicin, and continue the development of our other product candidates. Our expenses will also increase substantially if and as we:  
             
    conduct additional clinical trials for our product candidates;  

Table of Contents  

continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;  
                 
    establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;  
                 
    establish a manufacturing and supply chain sufficient for commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;  
                 
    maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;  
                 
    hire additional clinical, scientific and commercial personnel;  
                 
    add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as operating as a public reporting company; and  
                
    acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.  
     If our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, do not gain regulatory approval, or do not achieve market acceptance following regulatory approval and commercialization, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders  equity and working capital. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, if ever, we will become profitable.  
  We are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, plazomicin, which is in Phase 3 clinical development. If we are unable to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize plazomicin, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.  
  We currently have no products approved for sale, and since 2007, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of plazomicin. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and, ultimately, successfully commercialize plazomicin.  In early January 2016, we dosed our first patient in our Phase 3 EPIC trial, which we expect to serve as a single pivotal study supporting a new drug application ( NDA ) for plazomicin in the United States. In September 2014, we dosed our first patients in our Phase 3 CARE trial, and we stopped enrollment in the Phase 3 CARE study when we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 EPIC study in August 2016. We have not previously completed a clinical trial of plazomicin in patients with CRE infections, and we have no direct clinical evidence that plazomicin is effective in treating CRE infections in humans. Our Phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy of plazomicin compared with levofloxacin in patients with cUTI. Our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize plazomicin effectively will depend on several factors, including the following:  
             
    successful completion of our registration trial for plazomicin in our Phase 3 EPIC trial and our Phase 3 CARE trial, which will depend substantially upon the satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;  
                
    receipt of marketing approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;  
                
    receiving the product labeling that enables the successful promotion of plazomicin; 
                 
    establishing commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements;  
                 
    establishing a commercial infrastructure;  
                
    identifying and successfully establishing one or more collaborations to commercialize plazomicin;  
                
    acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;  
                 
    establishing market share while competing with other therapies;  
                 
    successfully executing our pricing and reimbursement strategy;  
                 
    a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the product following regulatory approval; and  

Table of Contents  

qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the product.  
     In addition, our product development and commercialization program includes the development of an   in vitro   diagnostic ( IVD ) assay which must be developed and would need to successfully complete a clinical performance study and be approved or cleared for marketing by the FDA and certain other foreign regulatory agencies, and then be commercialized concurrently with plazomicin in the associated markets. If we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for plazomicin or an IVD assay in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays to successfully develop and commercialize plazomicin, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 
  Our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2015. In June 2016, we received aggregate gross proceeds of $25.4 million in a private placement of equity securities and a $10.0 million term loan from Solar Capital. However, our only current source of revenue is for services performed for the research and development of our product candidates under government contracts, and we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until, and unless, we receive regulatory approval of and successfully commercialize plazomicin. Accordingly, our ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations or significantly curtail our operations to conserve our capital resources. Further, the perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations, or necessitate that we obtain financing on terms that are more favorable to investors, and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. 
  We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts. 
  Developing biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is an expensive and highly uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses to increase substantially as we continue the clinical development of our lead product candidate, plazomicin, seek marketing approval for plazomicin and continue the development of our other product candidates. If we obtain marketing approval of plazomicin, we also expect to incur significant sales, marketing, manufacturing and supply expenses. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had working capital of   $59.5 million   and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of   $61.1 million  . Management believes that, based on its current operating plans, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, combined with the committed funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) contract, is estimated to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements to fund our current planned operations at least through the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. In addition, other factors may arise causing us to need additional capital resources sooner than anticipated. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations, including for obtaining marketing approval for plazomicin. 
  We may obtain additional financing through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, a credit facility, government contracts and/or strategic collaborations. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to obtain debt financing may be limited by covenants we have made under our loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd. and our pledge to Solar Capital Ltd. of substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property, as collateral. The negative pledge in favor of Solar Capital Ltd. with respect to our intellectual property under the loan and security agreement could further limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. The amount and timing of our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
             
    the size, timing and type of the nonclinical and clinical studies that we decide to pursue in the development of our product candidates, including plazomicin; 
                
    the type, number, costs and results of the product candidate development programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; 
                
    the rate of progress and cost of our Phase 3 trials, any other clinical trials we may commence, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities; 

Table of Contents  

the costs associated with developing a plazomicin IVD assay to support therapeutic drug monitoring; 
                
    the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, including the preparation of a NDA for plazomicin, and any supplemental applications thereto; 
                
    our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; 
                
    the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation; 
                
    the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; 
                
    the resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates; 
                
    the scope, progress, expansion, and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; 
                
    our ability to enter into additional government contracts, or other collaborative agreements, to support the development of our product candidates and development efforts; and 
                
    the costs associated with being a public company. 
     Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies. We currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. 
  If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others technologies or clinical product candidates or programs that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. 
  Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes that may lead to delayed timelines and increased cost, and may prevent us from being able to complete clinical trials.  
  Clinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete, and its outcome and timeline is inherently uncertain. The results of preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in nonclinical and clinical studies for plazomicin do not ensure that our Phase 3 trials will demonstrate similar results or provide data supportive of similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. 
  The first patient in our Phase 3 EPIC trial for plazomicin was enrolled in early January 2016 and patient enrollment was completed in August 2016. We expect top-line results for our Phase 3 EPIC trial by the end of 2016 and expect to submit an NDA for plazomicin in the second half of 2017, with a planned commercial launch of plazomicin in the U.S. in 2018, if our NDA is approved. We also plan to submit a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") for plazomicin in 2018. 
  The first patient in our Phase 3 CARE trial for plazomicin was enrolled in September 2014. We ended enrollment in the CARE study in August 2016 and expect to announce top-line data results by the end of 2016, and to submit the study results as supportive data with the plazomicin NDA based on our Phase 3 EPIC trial.  We also plan to submit the results to a peer-reviewed journal and for presentation at medical meetings in 2016 and 2017.  Based on physician market research, we believe the Phase 3 CARE study will provide important and meaningful data regarding the efficacy, safety, microbiology, and dosing, as well as important health economic data, to better inform use of plazomicin in the treatment of patients with CRE infections. 
  We cannot be certain that our future clinical trials for plazomicin, or other product candidates, will progress as expected, not need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all, or support continued clinical development of the associated product candidate. 
  Clinical trials can be delayed, aborted or fail for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure:  
             
    to obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial in the countries where the trial is to be conducted; 

Table of Contents  

to successfully initiate a clinical trial, enroll patients, and complete clinical trial activities in foreign countries; 
                 
    to recruit and enroll suitable patients to participate in a trial; 
                 
    to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations ( CROs ), clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;  
                
    to obtain institutional review board ( IRB ) approval at each site;    
                
    to have patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;  
                 
    of clinical sites to adhere to trial protocols or continue to participate in a trial;  
                 
    to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;  
                 
    to address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;  
                 
    to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; 
                
    to manufacture sufficient quantities of product supply for use in clinical trials; or 
                
    to ensure clinical trial sites comply with Good Clinical Practice ("GCP") guidelines. 
     Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, slow down or halt our product development and approval processes, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing if needed. Patient enrollment in clinical trials is a function of many factors, including: the nature of clinical trial protocols, existence of competing protocols or treatments (if any), the size and longevity of the target patient population, proximity of patients to clinical sites and eligibility criteria for the clinical trials. Although we will continue to look for opportunities for faster regulatory approval of plazomicin or our other product candidates, we cannot guarantee that additional opportunities will arise, that the FDA or other regulatory authorities will agree with any additional proposals we make or that such additional proposals, even if approved, will be successful.  
  We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us upon recommendation of the data monitoring committee for such trial, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.  
  If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from the sale of any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval processes, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. 
  Our Phase 3 EPIC trial for plazomicin is subject to a number of specific risks that may affect the timeline and outcome of the trial, including the use of a new comparator drug and our lack of experience with clinical trials in certain foreign countries. 
  Our Phase 3 EPIC trial for plazomicin is subject to a number of specific risks arising from our clinical program and the design of the trial. For example, in our Phase 3 EPIC trial, plazomicin will be compared to meropenem. Although we have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrating that plazomicin was as effective as a comparator drug in treating cUTI, the results of our completed Phase 2 cUTI trial were based on a comparison to levofloxacin in treating cUTI, not meropenem. This use of a different comparator may cause our Phase 3 EPIC trial results to be unsuccessful or less favorable than anticipated, particularly if meropenem is more effective than levofloxacin in treating patients with cUTI.    
  Comparisons to results from other reported clinical trials, including our completed Phase 2 cUTI clinical trial, can assist in evaluating the potential efficacy of plazomicin; however, there are many factors that affect the outcome for patients in clinical trials, some of which are not apparent in published reports, and results from different trials often cannot be reliably

compared. Therefore, there is no assurance that the results of our Phase 3 EPIC trial for plazomicin will demonstrate safety and efficacy comparable to the results of trials conducted to date or will be sufficient to attain FDA approval.  
  Any failure to meet our endpoints in the Phase 3 EPIC trial or adequately address safety concerns would jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize plazomicin on schedule, or at all, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. 
  Our Phase 3 CARE trial for plazomicin is subject to a number of specific risks that may affect the outcome of the trial, including the lack of a prior clinical trial in patients with CRE infections.  
  Our Phase 3 CARE trial for plazomicin is subject to a number of specific risks arising from our clinical program and the design of the trial. We have not conducted a clinical trial of plazomicin in patients with CRE infections or with bloodstream infections or pneumonia, who are the subjects of our Phase 3 CARE trial, and we have no direct clinical evidence that plazomicin is effective in treating CRE infections in humans. Our Phase 2 trial demonstrated that plazomicin was as effective as the comparator drug in treating cUTI arising from non-CRE bacteria. Although we believe that plazomicin will be effective in treating CRE infections in humans based upon our nonclinical   in vitro   and   in vivo   animal model study results, together with our Phase 2 trial results, these results are not necessarily predictive of the results in humans and we cannot guarantee that plazomicin will demonstrate the expected efficacy in our Phase 3 CARE trial in patients. We also cannot guarantee that the data from our Phase 3 CARE trial will support the projections made from our pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models we developed from our nonclinical and clinical plazomicin studies. 
  Our Phase 3 CARE trial also involves dosing of patients with plazomicin for longer durations (7 14 days) than in our Phase 1 and 2 trials at the comparable dosage (up to five days), which may lead to additional or more severe adverse events than were reported in our Phase 1 and 2 trials, including as a result of toxicity in the kidneys, inner ear, or hypotension. 
  Even if successful, the revisions to our Phase 3 CARE trial protocol no longer allow it to be powered to demonstrate a superiority outcome and the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities as well as physicians and other third parties may not consider the data from our Phase 3 CARE trial to be supportive of plazomicin s potential to address serious bacterial infections caused by CRE.  
  Cohort 1 of our Phase 3 CARE trial was originally planned and the size estimated based on a superiority design.  We have recently decided to reduce the planned enrollment of our Phase 3 CARE trial.  With this reduced sample size, the study will not be powered to demonstrate superiority but we still expect the same trend in improvement with the plazomicin-based regimen compared to the comparator arm. We may be unable to demonstrate a clear trend in favor of plazomicin as the "mortality plus" and other endpoints will depend to a significant degree on the accuracy of our assumptions about the rates of mortality and a number of significant disease-related complications in the comparator and plazomicin arms of our Phase 3 CARE trial.  Although we believe we have been conservative in our assumptions, if, for example, patients in the comparator arm of our trial have significantly lower rates of mortality, or rates of applicable disease-related complications, than we expect, we may find that our trial is unfeasible or may have to enroll more patients at additional cost and delay. Our ability to claim certain of the market and label benefits that a successful superiority trial would have provided, will be reduced by pursuing a reduced target enrollment in our Phase 3 CARE trial. Further, the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities as well as physicians and other third parties may not consider the data from our Phase 3 CARE trial to be supportive of plazomicin s potential to address serious bacterial infections caused by CRE. 
  Failure to successfully develop, validate and obtain regulatory clearance or approval of a plazomicin IVD assay could harm our development and commercialization strategy for plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by CRE.  
  An important element of our development and commercialization strategy for plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by CRE is the development of an IVD assay to support the Therapeutic Drug Management ("TDM") of patients dosed with plazomicin; the plazomicin IVD assay is intended to measure levels of plazomicin in the blood so patients can receive safe and efficacious doses of plazomicin. In collaboration with ARK Diagnostics, Inc. ( ARK ), we co-developed such an assay for use in our Phase 3 CARE study and we intend to co-develop and commercialize an assay for use with plazomicin, if approved.  
  IVD assays are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and therefore require separate regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The development of a new IVD assay for a novel therapeutic such as plazomicin can be complex from an operational and regulatory perspective because of the need for both the drug and the diagnostic to receive regulatory clearance or approval. The regulatory pathway for the IVD will depend on the determination of a need for the assay demonstrated by our Phase 3 clinical studies.  Should the plazomicin assay  

Table of Contents  

be classified as a companion diagnostic, or the regulatory clearance or approval process for our IVD assay is delayed, it could impact our ability to successfully commercialize plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by CRE. 
  It may be necessary to resolve issues such as selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of a plazomicin assay during the development and regulatory approval process. We also expect to develop an assay for use on additional analyzers beyond the current Roche Modular P. We or our other current or future collaboration partners may encounter difficulties in developing, obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for, and manufacturing of, an assay with appropriate quality standards, similar to those we face with respect to our drug product candidates themselves. Failure to overcome these hurdles could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for or to obtain market acceptance for and to commercialize an IVD assay or plazomicin.  
  If we fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of plazomicin or any other product candidate that we develop to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of plazomicin or such other product candidate. This would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.  
  We are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote, or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or in other countries without obtaining approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, such as the EMA, and we may never receive such approvals. To gain approval to market a drug product, we must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product for the intended indication to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authority.  
  We have not previously submitted an NDA to the FDA, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that plazomicin will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, plazomicin may not receive regulatory approval even if it is successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approval for plazomicin, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market plazomicin, our revenue from this approval will be dependent, in part, upon our or a commercial partner s ability to obtain regulatory approval of an IVD assay to be used with plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by CRE, as well as upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights.  
  The FDA or any foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit, or deny approval of plazomicin for many reasons, including:  
             
    our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency that plazomicin is safe and effective for the requested indication;  
                
    the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s disagreement with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;  
                
    our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of plazomicin outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;  
                
    the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s requirement for additional preclinical or clinical studies;  
                 
    the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of plazomicin;  
                 
    the FDA s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; 
                 
    the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; or 
                 
    failure to adequately demonstrate study conduct oversight, ensure data integrity, and that clinical study sites complied with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, such that we do not pass pre-approval inspections by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. 
     Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA or foreign regulatory filing for plazomicin, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials which may be required after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve plazomicin for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA,  

Table of Contents  

or applicable foreign regulatory agency, may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of plazomicin. For example, we anticipate the NDA for plazomicin will initially be based on our Phase 3 EPIC trial and that, if approved, we anticipate the U.S. label will indicate that plazomicin is for use in patients with infections that have limited or no alternative antibiotic treatment options.  In addition, we believe that the label will include   in vitro   data against antibiotic resistant pathogens in the microbiology section of the drug label.  However, the FDA may approve a label that omits this   in vitro   data or that limits plazomicin to a more limited indication or narrower patient population, which may harm our ability to successfully commercialize plazomicin, if approved. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of plazomicin and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects. Any other product candidate we advanced to the marketing approval stage would also be subject to the risks delineated above.  
  Serious adverse events or other unexpected properties of plazomicin or any other product candidate may be identified during development or after approval that could delay, prevent or cause the withdrawal of regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval.  
  Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could result in a more restrictive label, the imposition of distribution or use restrictions or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If plazomicin or any of our other product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.  
  To date, plazomicin has generally been well tolerated in clinical trials conducted in healthy subjects, subjects with renal impairment, and in patients with cUTI, and there have been no reports of serious adverse events related to plazomicin in our completed clinical trials. However, our Phase 3 EPIC trial and our Phase 3 CARE trial for plazomicin call for more extended dosing (up to 7 days for our Phase 3 EPIC trial and 7 14 days for our Phase 3 CARE trial) than our Phase 1 and 2 trials at the comparable dosage (up to five days), which may lead to additional or more severe adverse events than were reported in our Phase 1 and 2 trials. Toxicity in the kidneys and inner ear are the most significant identified risks for plazomicin, which are well-known risks for the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics. Hypotension is also a potential risk for plazomicin.  
  Undesirable side effects or other unexpected adverse events or properties of plazomicin or any of our other product candidates could arise or become known either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed. If such an event occurs during development, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, plazomicin or our other product candidates. If such an event occurs after plazomicin or such other product candidates are approved, a number of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including:  
              
    regulatory authorities may withdraw the approval of such product;  
                 
    regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions;  
                 
    regulatory authorities may require one or more post-market studies;  
                 
    we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;  
                 
    we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and  
                 
    our reputation may suffer.     
     Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.  
  We cannot predict to what extent bacteria may develop resistance to plazomicin or how resistance could spread, which could affect the revenue potential for plazomicin.  
  We are developing plazomicin to treat multi-drug resistant ("MDR") infections. The bacteria responsible for these infections evolve quickly and readily transfer their resistance mechanisms within and between species. Furthermore, some resistance to plazomicin already exists and we cannot predict how the prevalence of bacterial resistance to plazomicin will change over time.  

Table of Contents  

As with some other commercially available aminoglycosides, plazomicin is not active against organisms expressing a resistance mechanism known as ribosomal methyltransferase. Although occurrence of this resistance mechanism among CRE varies regionally and is currently rare in the United States, there have been isolated cases of infections by bacteria carrying ribosomal methyltransferase in the United States. We cannot predict whether ribosomal methyltransferase will become widespread in regions where we intend to market plazomicin if it is approved. The growth of MDR infections in community settings or in countries with poor public health infrastructures, or the potential use of plazomicin outside of controlled hospital settings, could contribute to the rise of plazomicin resistance. If resistance to plazomicin becomes prevalent, our ability to generate revenue from plazomicin could suffer.  
  We may become dependent on ARK or an alternative collaboration partner to commercialize an IVD assay.  
  Should we enter into an agreement with ARK or an alternative collaboration partner for the development and commercialization of a plazomicin IVD assay, we would be dependent on ARK or such collaboration partner with respect to such manufacturing and supply and with respect to commercialization in the United States and the EU. This would reduce our control over these activities but would not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards with respect to plazomicin.  
  We or ARK, or an alternative collaboration partner we may work with, may encounter difficulties in developing an assay for commercial application in one or more countries, including issues in relation to automation, selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of such assay. If ARK or any such alternative collaborator does not perform its contractual duties or obligations, experiences work stoppages, does not meet expected deadlines, terminates its agreements with us or needs to be replaced, or if they otherwise do not meet our expectations for development, manufacture or commercialization of the assay, we may need to enter into new arrangements with one or more alternative third parties for development, manufacture or commercialization of the assay or an alternative assay. We may not be able to do so on commercially reasonably terms, or within the terms of the commercialization agreement without amending such terms, or at all, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations related to plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by CRE.  
  If we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.  
  Although a substantial amount of our efforts is focused, and will continue to be focused, on our Phase 3 trials and potential approval of our lead product candidate, plazomicin, a key element of our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize a portfolio of therapeutics to treat MDR bacterial infections. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and are exploring, and intend to explore in the future, strategic partnerships for the development of new products. Other than plazomicin, all of our other potential product candidates remain in the discovery and preclinical stages.     
  Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:  
             
    the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;  
                
    we may be unable to successfully modify candidate compounds to be active in gram-negative bacteria or defeat bacterial resistance mechanisms or identify viable product candidates in our screening campaigns;  
                
    competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;  
                 
    product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third party patents or other exclusive rights;  
                 
    a product candidate may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;  
                
    a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;  
                 
    a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors; and  
                 
    the development of bacterial resistance to potential product candidates may render them ineffective against target infections.

We withdrew ACHN-975, one of the product candidates from our LpxC inhibitor development program, from clinical trials due to inflammation at the infusion site in some of our Phase 1 subjects and withdrew the Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for this compound in May 2014. We are actively assessing alternative backup compounds in order to identify candidates that preclinical lab tests will show are effective and likely to exhibit a superior clinical safety profile. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful. If we identify viable product candidates, we would have to submit a new IND application for any compound we seek to advance to clinical trials. 
  If we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional product candidates, our potential for growth may be impaired.  
  Even if a product candidate does obtain regulatory approval it may never achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, hospitals, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity may be smaller than we estimate.  
  Even if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals, and are able to launch plazomicin or any other product candidate commercially, the product candidate may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals (including pharmacy directors) and third-party payors and, ultimately, may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance and market opportunity of any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:  
              
    the efficacy and safety of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials;  
                 
    relative convenience and ease of administration;  
                
    the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;  
                 
    the potential and perceived advantages and disadvantages of the product candidates, including cost and clinical benefit relative to alternative treatments;  
                 
    the willingness of physicians to prescribe the product;  
                
    the willingness of hospital pharmacy directors to purchase our products for their formularies;  
                
    acceptance by physicians, operators of hospitals and treatment facilities and parties responsible for reimbursement of the product;  
                 
    the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;  
                 
    the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;  
                
    the strength of our marketing and distribution support;  
                 
    limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product s approved labeling or an approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;  
                 
    whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;  
                 
    the approval of other new products for the same indications;  
                 
    the timing of market introduction of the approved product as well as competitive products;  
                
    adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;  
                
    the emergence of bacterial resistance to the product candidate; and  
                 
    the rate at which resistance to other drugs in the target infections grow.  
     Any failure by plazomicin or any other product candidate that obtains regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our business prospects.  
  The availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products is uncertain, and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors could impede our ability to market any future products we may develop and could limit our ability to generate revenue.  

Table of Contents  

There is significant uncertainty related to the third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved medical products. The commercial success of our future products in both domestic and international markets depends on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available for our future products. Governmental payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to manage their healthcare expenditures by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and biologics and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate reimbursement for our future products. These payors may not view our future products as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers or may not be sufficient to allow our future products to be marketed on a competitive basis.  
  Third-party payors are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and coverage and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit or delay coverage and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated revenue from the sale of our product candidates. If we decrease the prices for our product candidates because of competitive pressures or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.  
  In addition, to the extent that our product candidates will be used in a hospital inpatient setting, hospitals often receive fixed reimbursement for all of a patient s care, including the cost of our drug products and IVD assay, based on the patient s diagnosis. For example, Medicare reimbursement for hospital inpatient stays is generally made under a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as the Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups. Our patients  access to adequate coverage and reimbursement by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our future products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.  
  We are developing our lead product candidate plazomicin for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE, which constitute a growing but relatively small patient population. Antibiotics have historically been marketed towards broad patient populations at relatively low prices. Based on the high unmet medical need in the treatment of these infections and the high costs of treating antibiotic resistant infections, we are targeting value-based pricing for plazomicin. If hospitals or governmental or other third-party payors do not view the benefits of plazomicin as worth the cost, we will be unable to achieve our pricing and reimbursement objectives and our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.  
  We rely on third parties to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.  
  We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials on our product candidates in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and the applicable legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as current good clinical practices ( cGCPs ), for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. If we or any of our third party contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, we are required to report certain financial interests of our third party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds and meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data from those clinical trials conducted by principal investigators who previously served or currently serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation in connection with such services. Our clinical trials must also generally be conducted with products produced under current good manufacturing practice ( cGMP ) regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.  
  Many of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If the third parties conducting our preclinical studies or our clinical trials do not perform their  

Table of Contents  

contractual duties or obligations or comply with regulatory requirements we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be costly, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, or to commercialize such product candidate being tested in such studies or trials. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third party contractors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.  
  We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply plazomicin and other product candidates for us, as well as certain raw materials used in the production thereof. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately we may be required to incur significant delays and costs to find new suppliers or manufacturers.  
  We currently have limited experience in, and we do not own facilities for, manufacturing our product candidates, including plazomicin. We rely upon third-party manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply our product candidates and certain raw materials used in the production thereof. Some of our key components for the production of plazomicin have a limited number of suppliers. In particular, sisomicin, the aminoglycoside precursor for plazomicin, is supplied by a single manufacturer in China for which we do not have a commercial supply agreement.  
  The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacture of our drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.  
  We do not have commercial supply agreements with our suppliers. In the event that we and our suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide clinical and commercial supply needs, we would not be able to manufacture our product or candidates until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, which could also delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, our product candidates.  
  Our third party suppliers may not be able to meet our supply needs or timelines and this may negatively affect our business. A majority of the manufacturing process is operated internationally, and therefore may be subject to similar risks of the sort described by the risk factor entitled    A variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business  .      
  The failure of third-party manufacturers or suppliers to perform adequately or the termination of our arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.  
  A variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.  
  Certain of our existing suppliers are located outside of the United States, including our sole source supplier for sisomicin, a key raw material for the production of plazomicin, which is located in China, and for which we do not have a commercial supply agreement. Additionally, if plazomicin is approved for commercialization outside the United States, we will likely seek to enter into agreements with third parties to market plazomicin outside the United States. We are, or we expect that we will be, subject to additional risks related to these international business relationships, including:  
              
    different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;  
                 
    differing U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;  
                
    reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries;  
                 
    unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;  
                 
    different reimbursement systems;  
                
    economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;  

Table of Contents  

compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;  
                 
    foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;  
                 
    potential liability resulting from development work conducted by these third parties; and  
                 
    business interruptions resulting from geopolitical events, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters. 
     We may be subject to costly product liability claims related to our clinical trials and product candidates and, if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.  
  Because we conduct clinical trials with human patients, we face the risk that the use of our product candidates may result in adverse side effects to patients in our clinical trials. We face even greater risks upon any commercialization of our product candidates. Although we have product liability insurance, which covers our clinical trials for up to $5 million, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer, and we will be required to increase our product liability insurance coverage for our advanced clinical trials that we plan to initiate. We do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage. Where we have provided indemnities in favor of third parties under our agreements with them, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our product candidates or products causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:  
             
    withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, investigators, patients or trial sites;      
                
    the inability to commercialize our product candidates;  
                
    decreased demand for our product candidates;  
                 
    regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;  
                 
    loss of revenue;  
                
    substantial costs of litigation;  
                 
    liabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves;  
                 
    an increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all;  
                 
    the diversion of management s attention from our business; and  
                 
    damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products.  
     Product liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.  
  If we fail to establish an effective distribution process, which includes utilizing cold-chain logistics for plazomicin and the associated IVD assay, our business may be adversely affected.  
  We do not currently have the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products to patients. We intend to contract with a third-party logistics company to warehouse these products and distribute them, and we will require plazomicin and the associated IVD assay to be maintained at a controlled temperature for some of the distribution chain. Failure to secure contracts with a logistics company could negatively impact the distribution of plazomicin or the IVD assay. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of plazomicin and the associated IVD assay will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.  

Table of Contents  

In addition, the use of third party distributors, including with respect to cold-chain logistics for plazomicin and the associated IVD assay, involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that distributors or pharmacies will:  
             
    not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using plazomicin or the IVD assay, or complaints regarding them;  
                
    not effectively sell or support plazomicin or the associated IVD assay with sufficient cold storage;  
                
    reduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support plazomicin or the IVD assay;  
                 
    not devote the resources necessary to sell plazomicin or the IVD assay in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;  
                 
    be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or  
                 
    cease operations.  
     Plazomicin is still undergoing evaluation for, and we expect our IVD assay will have, a room temperature shelf life. Currently cold-chain logistics is required and if we do not effectively maintain our cold-chain supply logistics, then we may experience an unusual number of product returns or out of date product. Any such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business.  
  We currently have limited sales and marketing and distribution staff. If we are unable to develop an adequate sales and marketing and distribution capability on our own or through third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our future products.  
  We currently have limited sales, marketing and distribution staff and no history in this capacity. To achieve commercial success for any approved product candidate, we must either develop an adequate sales, marketing and distribution organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If we rely on third parties for selling, marketing and distributing our approved products, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially within our control, and our product revenue may be lower than if we directly sold or marketed our products. If we are unable to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute product candidates for which we have received regulatory approval on acceptable terms or at all, we will need to market these products ourselves. This is likely to be expensive and logistically difficult, as it would require us to build our own sales, marketing and distribution capacity. We have no historical operations in this area, and if such efforts were necessary, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our future products. If we are not successful in commercializing our future products, either on our own or through third parties, any future product revenue will be materially and adversely affected, which would harm our business.  
  We face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.  
  The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to plazomicin and other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of MDR infections. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, safer or less costly than plazomicin or any other product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.  
  There are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of MDR infections that we would expect would compete with plazomicin, including Avycaz   TM    (ceftazadime/avibactam), which is marketed by Allergan plc in the United States and marketed by Pfizer outside the United States, tigecycline, which is marketed by Pfizer as Tygacil , other aminoglycosides that are generically available (such as gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin), and polymixins that are generically available (colistin and polymixin B). Many of the available therapies are well-established and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. If plazomicin is approved, it may be priced at a premium over other competitive products. This may limit plazomicin s adoption for MDR gram-negative infections.  
  There are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development by third parties to treat MDR gram-negative infections. Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing eravacycline for complicated urinary and intra-abdominal infections,  

Table of Contents  

as well as pneumonia. The Medicines Company is developing Carbavance  for cUTI and various infection types due to CRE. Merck   Co., Inc. is developing imipenem/relebactam for complicated urinary and intra-abdominal infections, and potentially for pneumonia. Zavante Therapeutics, Inc. is developing ZTI-01 for cUTI.  Shionogi is developing cefiderocol for carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens. We may also eventually face competition from products in earlier development stage. If our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than us, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.  
  In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was passed, which included the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act (the  GAIN Act ). The GAIN Act provides incentives for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products, including adding five years to the otherwise applicable regulatory exclusivity period. We requested and the FDA granted qualified infectious disease product designation for plazomicin for the treatment of hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, cUTIs, and catheter-related bloodstream infections on December 14, 2014. The incentives provided under the GAIN Act, along with government contract funding and other incentives for antibiotic research, may result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics.  
  Many of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.  
  Finally, the success of any product that is successfully commercialized will depend in large part on our ability to prevent competitors from launching a generic version that would compete with such product. If such competitors are able to establish that our patents are invalid or not infringed by the generic version of our product, they may be able to launch a generic product prior to the expected expiration of our relevant patents, and any generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.  
  We may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to our product candidates, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter our development and commercialization plans.  
  We may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. For example, we currently intend to identify one or more strategic partners for the commercialization of plazomicin, and we may also attempt to find one or more strategic partners for the development or commercialization of one or more of our other product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time-consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships for our product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.  
  Any delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop or commercialize our product candidates could negatively impact the development or commercialization of our product candidates in geographic regions where we do not have development and commercialization infrastructure. Absent a collaboration partner, we would need to undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our product candidates or bring them to market and our business may be materially and adversely affected.  
  We may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.  
  Even if we are successful in entering into a collaboration with respect to the development or commercialization of one or more product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:  
              
    collaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;  
                
    collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;  

Table of Contents  

collaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates if the collaborators view our product candidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;  
                
    disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time-consuming, distracting and expensive;  
                
    collaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;  
                
    collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;  
                 
    the collaborations may not result in us achieving revenue to justify such transactions; and  
                 
    collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate.  
     As a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates.  
  Our operating activities may be restricted as a result of covenants related to the indebtedness under our loan agreement and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
  On August 5, 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Solar Capital Ltd., pursuant to which Solar Capital Ltd. agreed to make available to us term loans with an aggregate principal amount of up to $25 million, $15 million of which was provided to us on August 5, 2015 and $10 million of which was provided to us on June 20, 2016. Until we have repaid such indebtedness, the loan and security agreement subjects us to various customary covenants, including requirements as to financial reporting and insurance, and restrictions on our ability to dispose of our business or property, to change our line of business, to liquidate or dissolve, to enter into any change in control transaction, to merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, to incur additional indebtedness, to incur liens on our property, to pay any dividends or other distributions on capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock, to redeem capital stock, to enter into licensing agreements, to engage in transactions with affiliates, or to encumber our intellectual property. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions on our ability to operate our business. 
  Additionally, we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the loan facility if an event of default occurs under the loan and security agreement. Under the loan and security agreement, an event of default will occur if, among other things, we fail to make payments under the loan and security agreement; we breach any of our covenants under the loan and security agreement, subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches; the Lender determines that a material adverse change has occurred; we or our assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings; we are unable to pay our debts as they become due; or we default on contracts with third parties which would permit the holder of indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or that could have a material adverse change on us. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default occurs. In this case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Solar Capital Ltd. could also exercise its rights as collateral agent to take possession of and to dispose of the collateral securing the term loans, which collateral includes substantially all of our property (excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge). Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events. 
  We may need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.  
  As of September 30, 2016, we had 96 employees. We will need to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and commercialize plazomicin or other product candidates. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our business strategy requires that we:  
             
    manage all our Phase 3 trials, which are being conducted at multiple trial sites, and manage any other clinical trials;  
                
    manage our internal discovery and development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors, government agencies, any future collaborators and other third parties;  

Table of Contents  

continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and  
                
    identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees.  
     If we are unable to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources to the extent required to manage our development and commercialization activities, our business will be materially adversely affected.  
  We are highly dependent on the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Kenneth J. Hillan, M.B., Ch.B. and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.  
  We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Hillan. If we are not able to retain Dr. Hillan or are not able to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow. Although we have executed employment agreements with each member of our current executive management team, including Dr. Hillan, we may not be able to retain their services as expected. In addition to the competition for personnel, the San Francisco Bay Area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living. Although we historically have not had any material difficulty attracting qualified experienced personnel to our company, we could in the future have such difficulties and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts.  
  In addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours.  
  If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. 
  Recent changes in our executive leadership and any similar changes in the future may serve as a significant distraction for our management and employees. 
  Since the beginning of 2015, there have been a number of changes to our executive leadership team. In July 2016, we hired our Chief Financial Officer, Tobin Schilke. In October 2015, we hired our Chief Operating Officer, Blake Wise. Such changes, or any other future changes in our executive leadership, may disrupt our operations as we adjust to the reallocation of responsibilities and assimilate new leadership and, potentially, differing perspectives on our strategic direction. If the transition in executive leadership is not smooth, the resulting disruption could negatively affect our operations and impede our ability to execute our strategic plan.  
  Our business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.  
  Our third-party manufacturers  activities and our own activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our pharmaceutical product candidates, test samples and reagents, biological materials and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and/or interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.  
  Our internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.  
  Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or disruption from computer viruses, software bugs, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication, equipment and electrical failures. While we have not, to our  

Table of Contents  

knowledge, experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure or theft of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, the further development of our product candidates could be delayed or our competitive position could be compromised.     
  Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.  
  We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (1) FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.  
  We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.  
  Prior to our initial public offering ("IPO") in March 2014, we had not been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or any securities exchange relating to public companies. We continue to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, the expenses associated with being a public company could be material, particularly after we cease to be an  emerging growth company.  Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies require considerable time and attention of management. In addition, the changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis.  
  In addition, certain types of insurance, including directors  and officers  liability insurance are more expensive as a public company. Being a public company could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.  
  If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.  
  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We will be evaluating our internal controls systems to allow management to report on, and eventually our independent auditors will attest to, the effectiveness of the operation of our internal controls. We will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and eventual auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The  

Table of Contents  

aforementioned auditor attestation requirements will not apply to us until we are no longer considered an  emerging growth company.   
  We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation action or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price. Deficient internal controls could also cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our stock price.  
  Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.  
  We have designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  
  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the acts of some individuals, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  
  We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.  
  Our corporate headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.  
  If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our information technology systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
  Furthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are geographically concentrated and operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
  Risks Related to Our U.S. Government Contracts  
  Our use of government funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of product candidates developed under those government-funded programs. 
  Our development of plazomicin as a countermeasure for diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biothreats is currently being funded in significant part through a contract with BARDA. We are also receiving funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ("NIAID") for one of our pre-clinical programs and we in the past received funding for other programs from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency ("DTRA") and from NIAID. Contracts funded by the U.S. government and its agencies, including our contract with BARDA, include provisions that reflect the government s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:  
             
    terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;  
                 
    reduce or modify the government s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;  
                 
    claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;  

Table of Contents  

audit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;  
                 
    suspend the contractor from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;  
                 
    impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;  
                 
    suspend or debar the contractor from doing future business with the government;  
                 
    control and potentially prohibit the export of products; and  
                 
    pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act ( FCA ), the False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements.  
     We may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using or allowing others to use certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally obtains the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.  
  In addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:  
             
    specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts;  
                 
    mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;  
                 
    public disclosures of certain contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and  
                 
    mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, anti-human-trafficking, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.  
     If we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential contract or FCA liability and to termination of our contracts.  
  We are dependent on our BARDA contract to fund portions of our Phase 3 CARE trial and Phase 3 EPIC trial. If we do not receive all of the funds under this contract, we may be forced to suspend or terminate either or both of these programs or obtain alternative sources of funding. 
  We expect a significant portion of the funding for our Phase 3 CARE trial and Phase 3 EPIC trial will continue to come from our BARDA contract. BARDA may terminate our contract at any time for convenience and there can be no assurances that this contract will not be terminated. Changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and de-prioritized emphasis on supporting the development of antibacterial products such as plazomicin. Although we are currently using a portion of the net proceeds from our IPO and other debt and equity offerings to fund our plazomicin development program, any reduction or delay in BARDA funding may force us to suspend or terminate the program or seek alternative funding, which may not be available on non-dilutive terms, terms favorable to us or at all.  
  U.S. government agencies have special contracting requirements that give them the ability to unilaterally control our contracts.  
  U.S. government contracts typically contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally:  
             
    audit and object to our BARDA contract-related costs and fees, and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees;  
                
    suspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending our existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;  
                
    cancel, terminate or suspend our contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;  

Table of Contents  

terminate our contracts if in the government s interest, including if funds become unavailable to the applicable governmental agency;  
                 
    reduce the scope and value of our contract; and  
                
    change certain terms and conditions in our contract.  
     The U.S. government will be able to terminate any of its contracts with us, either for convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with or to achieve the milestones set forth in the contract schedules and terms. Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination. Except for the amount of services received by the government, termination-for-default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source.  
  The U.S. government s determination to award a future contract or contract option may be challenged by an interested party, such as another bidder, at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (the  GAO ), or in federal court. If such a challenge is successful, our BARDA contract or any future contract we may be awarded may be terminated.  
  The laws and regulations governing the procurement of goods and services by the U.S. government provide procedures by which other bidders and interested parties may challenge the award of a government contract. If we are awarded a government contract, such challenges or protests could be filed even if there are not any valid legal grounds on which to base the protest. If any such protests are filed, the government agency may decide to suspend our performance under the contract while such protests are being considered by the GAO or the applicable federal court, thus potentially delaying delivery of payment. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable funds to defend any potential award. If a protest is successful, the government may be ordered to terminate any one or more of our contracts and reselect bids. The government agencies with which we have contracts could even be directed to award a potential contract to one of the other bidders.  
  Our business is subject to audit by the U.S. government, including under our contracts with BARDA and NIAID, and a negative outcome in an audit could adversely affect our business.  
  U.S. government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the "DCAA") routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.  
  The DHHS and the DCAA also review the adequacy of, and a contractor s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be paid, while such costs already paid must be refunded. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including:  
             
    termination of contracts;  
                 
    forfeiture of profits;  
                
    suspension of payments;  
                 
    fines; and  
                
    suspension or prohibition from conducting business with the U.S. government.  
     In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could cause our stock price to decrease.  
  Laws and regulations affecting government contracts make it more expensive and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.  
  We must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which can make it more difficult for us to retain our rights under our BARDA contract. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with government agencies. Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:  
              
    the Federal Acquisition Regulations ( FAR ) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;  

Table of Contents  

business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and include other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  
                 
    export and import control laws and regulations; and  
                
    laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.  
     Any changes in applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to maintain our existing BARDA contract and obtain new contracts, which could limit our ability to conduct our business and materially adversely affect our results of operations.     
  Risks Related to Intellectual Property  
  If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely affected.  
  We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. In particular, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates. However, we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.  
  Further, the patentability of inventions, and the validity, enforceability and scope of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involve complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. As a result, patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries for many reasons. For example, there is no assurance that we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications in respect of the inventions claimed in our patent applications. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. We may also be unaware of certain prior art relating to our patent applications and patents, which could prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, or result in an issued patent being invalidated. Even if patents have issued, or do successfully issue, from patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, license or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market any of our product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. Changes to the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could also diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection.  
  Furthermore, certain of the patents that we license from the University of Washington ("UW") are co-owned by Novartis AG. The exclusivity of our license from UW is therefore subject to Novartis  rights to use the licensed patents and technology for its own purposes, and to grant licenses to others to do so. We therefore rely primarily on our owned patent rights to provide patent protection for our LpxC inhibitor compounds. However, none of these owned patent rights have yet issued in the United States, and if these fail to result in issued patents, our competitive position could be adversely affected.  
  If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.  
  In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on confidential proprietary information, including trade secrets, and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and  

Table of Contents  

other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Further, the laws of some foreign countries, including China, where we currently source raw materials for plazomicin, do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  
  If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.  
  There is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology or product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ). Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.  
  If we are found to infringe a third party s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys  fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.  
  We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.  
  Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors, or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims that we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the other party in such infringement proceeding from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent.  

Table of Contents  

Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party, or could cause us to lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, if any license is offered at all. Litigation or other proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may also become involved in disputes with others regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights. For example, we jointly develop intellectual property with certain parties, and disagreements may therefore arise as to the ownership of the intellectual property developed pursuant to these relationships. If we are unable to resolve these disputes, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights.  
  We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.  
  Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.  
  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.  
  Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, including China, where we currently source raw materials for plazomicin. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.  
  If we breach any of the agreements under which we license the use, development and commercialization rights to our product candidates from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.  
  While the primary patent family covering plazomicin is Achaogen-owned, our development and commercialization of plazomicin is subject to our license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly known as Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and a portion of the patent portfolio for our LpxC inhibitor program is in-licensed from UW. Under our existing license agreements, we are subject to various obligations, including diligence obligations with respect to development and commercialization activities, payment obligations for achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales, as well as other material obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, our licensing collaborators may have the right to terminate the applicable license in whole or in part. The loss of our license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. could materially adversely affect our ability to proceed with the development or potential commercialization of plazomicin as currently planned, while the loss of our license agreement with UW could materially adversely affect our ability to proceed with any development or potential commercialization of our LpxC inhibitor program.

The risks described elsewhere pertaining to our patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure by us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, we do not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and may not have sufficient ability to consult and input into the patent prosecution and maintenance process with respect to such patents, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents.  
  Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.  
  The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:  
             
    others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;  
                
    we or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application that we own or license;  
                
    we or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention;  
                
    others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;  
                
    pending patent applications that we own or license may not lead to issued patents;  
                 
    issued patents that we own or license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;  
                 
    our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;  
                
    we may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and  
                 
    the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.  
     Should any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.  
  Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.  
  Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to use our technologies and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.     
  Provisions in our U.S. government contracts, including our contract with BARDA, may affect our intellectual property rights.  
  Certain of our activities have been funded, and may in the future be funded, by the U.S. government, including our contract with BARDA. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including the right to a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise  march-in  rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government, U.S. government funding  

Table of Contents  

must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications, and our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products in the United States.  
  Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.  
  On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the  Leahy-Smith Act ) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has promulgated regulations and developed procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not come into effect until March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  
  We may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former or other employers.  
  Many of our employees and consultants, including our senior management, have been employed or retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees or consultants have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee s or consultant s former or other employer. We are not aware of any material threatened or pending claims related to these matters, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.  
  If we do not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.  
  Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one or more of our U.S. patents covering our approved product(s) or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.  
  If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.     
  Risks Related to Government Regulation  
  The regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining, or cause delays in obtaining, approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates, which will materially impair our ability to generate revenue.  
  The design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, selling, import, export, advertising, promotion, and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, principally by the FDA, and foreign regulatory authorities, with regulations differing from country to country. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. Neither we nor any future collaboration partner is permitted to market plazomicin or any other product candidate in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA.  
  We have not submitted an application or obtained marketing approval for plazomicin or any other product candidate anywhere in the world. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish to  

Table of Contents  

the FDA s satisfaction the product candidate s safety and efficacy for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product candidate. Obtaining regulatory approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:  
              
    warning letters;  
                
    civil and criminal penalties;  
                 
    injunctions;  
                
    withdrawal of approved products;  
                 
    product seizure or detention;  
                
    product recalls;  
                 
    total or partial suspension of production; and  
                
    refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.  
     Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our product candidates in the United States or abroad, we and any applicable collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical trial or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical trials. Additionally, data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our studies and trials less favorably than we do. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for a product candidate is promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering any product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of such product candidates and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of such product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that plazomicin or any other product candidate that we develop is not effective, or is only moderately effective, or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profile or other characteristics that preclude marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. In addition, any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. 
  The regulatory approval process is expensive and may take several years to complete. The FDA and foreign regulatory entities have substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:  
             
    product candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;  
                 
    FDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;  
                
    the FDA may request additional analyses, reports, data and studies;  
                
    the FDA may ask questions regarding, or adopt different interpretations of, data and results;  
                 
    the FDA might not approve our or our third-party manufacturer s processes or facilities; or  
                 
    the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.  
     Although we have received FDA fast-track designation for our development of plazomicin to treat serious CRE infections, we cannot guarantee that we will experience a faster review or approval process compared to conventional FDA

procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast-track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.  
  If any of our product candidates fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, or if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed.  
  Even if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to restrictions, withdrawal from the market, or penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if approved.  
  Once regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Manufacturers of our products and manufacturers  facilities are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. If we, any future collaboration partner or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the collaboration partner, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.  
  The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. The FDA also imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers  communications regarding off-label use and if we do not restrict the marketing of our products only to their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:  
             
    warning letters or untitled letters;  
                 
    mandated modifications to promotional materials or the required provision of corrective information to healthcare practitioners;  
                 
    restrictions imposed on the product or its manufacturers or manufacturing processes;  
                 
    restrictions imposed on the labeling or marketing of the product;  
                 
    restrictions imposed on product distribution or use;  
                
    requirements for post-marketing clinical trials;  
                
    suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;  
                
    suspension of or withdrawal of regulatory approval;  
                 
    voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;  
                 
    refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications filed by us;  

Table of Contents  

restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;  
                 
    seizure or detention of our products;  
                
    refusal to permit the import or export of our products;  
                 
    required entry into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines (including restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue), reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;  
                
    civil or criminal penalties; or  
                 
    injunctions.  
     Widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the imposition by the FDA of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies ( REMS ) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, because of the serious public health risks of high profile adverse safety events with certain products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly REMS programs.  
  The regulatory requirements and policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted for which we may also be required to comply. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. If we or any future collaboration partner are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or such collaboration partner, as applicable, will not be permitted to market our future products and our business will suffer.  
  Failure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our product candidates internationally.  
  We may seek a distribution and marketing collaborator for plazomicin or other product candidates commercialized outside of the United States. In order to market our product candidates in the European Economic Area (the  EEA ), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or our collaboration partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization ( MA ). There are two types of marketing authorizations:  
              
    the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as for drugs produced through certain specified biotechnological processes (such as recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells, and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods), advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.  
                 
    national MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.  
     Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.     
  We have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing. In addition, the time required to obtain approval from foreign regulatory authorities may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and  

Table of Contents  

approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on our ability to obtain approval in other countries. The foreign regulatory approval process generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may or may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.  
  Our product development program for plazomicin is dependent, in part, upon our or a commercial partner s ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of an IVD assay to be used with plazomicin.  
  Our product development program for plazomicin includes the development of an IVD assay, which must itself successfully complete a clinical performance study conducted concurrently with and utilizing patient samples from the Phase 3 CARE trial of plazomicin, be approved or cleared for marketing by the FDA and certain other foreign regulatory agencies, and then be commercialized concurrently with plazomicin in the associated markets.  
  Before marketing or selling a new medical device, we or our commercial partner must obtain either clearance from the FDA under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA") or approval of a pre-market approval ( PMA ) application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is  substantially equivalent  to a device legally on the market, known as a  predicate  device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Both the 510(k) and PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and require the payment of significant fees, unless an exemption applies. The FDA s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but may take longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is costlier and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes at least one year or longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. We do not know at present whether the 510(k) clearance process will be available for our IVD   assay  . If not, we will need to undertake a costlier and uncertain PMA process.  
  If the FDA requires us or our commercial partner to go through the PMA process, the introduction of our IVD and plazomicin could be delayed or canceled.  
  In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of the IVD assay or impact our ability to modify the IVD assay on a timely basis after it has been approved or cleared. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our IVD assay could prevent us from generating revenue from plazomicin and the IVD assay and adversely affect our business operations and financial results. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products.  
  Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The foreign regulatory approval or certification process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval. If we fail to receive necessary approvals or certifications to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, foreign regulatory requirements have become increasingly stringent in recent years, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign regulatory authorities in the future. Penalties for a company s noncompliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company s business license and criminal sanctions. In addition, the costs associated with compliance with any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us. 
  Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates  commercial success.  
  In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which is intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, the President signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"). It contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal  

Table of Contents  

healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The ACA, among other things:  
              
    imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell  branded prescription drugs   
                 
    increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;  
                 
    imposes a 2.3% medical device excise tax that manufacturers and importers will be required to pay on their sales of certain medical devices;  
                 
    requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;  
                 
    addresses new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extension products;  
                
    requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and  
                 
    mandates a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states.  
     Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.  
  We are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.  
  Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients  rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:  
             
    the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;  
                
    the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;  
                
    federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;  
                
    the federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals,  

Table of Contents  

and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;  
             
    the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and  
                
    state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.  
     Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the recently enacted ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.  
  Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal and other related expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.  
  Risks Related to Our Common Stock  
  The price of our common stock may be volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid.  
  There was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO in March 2014, the trading volume of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market has been limited since then, and there can be no assurance that an active and liquid trading market for our common stock will be sustained. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of or sustain an active trading market on The NASDAQ Global Market or otherwise or how liquid that market might become. If an active public market is not sustained, it may be difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of common stock at prices that are attractive to them, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products, product candidates or technologies by using our shares of common stock as consideration. Stockholders may also be unable to sell their shares of common stock at prices that are attractive to them due to volatility in the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:  
             
    announcements relating to our current development program for plazomicin, including any periodic updates relating to timing of top-line data for our Phase 3 EPIC trial and our Phase 3 CARE trial, adverse events, site initiation, and timing of release of interim analyses and final trial results or revisions, modifications to our clinical development plan for plazomicin, including changes to enrollment protocols or additional clinical trials;  
                
    results from, or any delays in, clinical trial programs relating to our product candidates, including our Phase 3 trials;  
                
    delays in commercializing or obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates;  
                
    any need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need to conduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates;  

Table of Contents  

capital fundraising or other financing activities that contain onerous or unfavorable terms; 
                
    manufacturing issues related to our product candidates for clinical trials or future products for commercialization;  
                
    commercial success and market acceptance of our product candidates following regulatory approval;  
                
    undesirable side effects caused by product candidates after they have entered the market;  
                
    spread of bacterial resistance to our product candidates;  
                
    ability to discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;  
                
    announcements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development or commercialization of our product candidates, or the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;  
                
    announcements relating to the receipt, modification or termination of government contracts or grants, or the timing of payments we may receive under these arrangements;  
                
    success of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products;  
                
    strategic transactions undertaken by us;  
                
    additions or departures of key personnel;  
                
    product liability claims related to our clinical trials or product candidates;  
                
    prevailing economic conditions;  
                
    business disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters;  
                
    disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;  
                
    FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;  
                
    healthcare reform measures in the United States or other countries;  
                
    sales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;  
                
    future sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;  
                
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; and  
                
    the issuance of new or changed securities analysts  reports or recommendations regarding us. 
     In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.  
  Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.  
  As of September 30, 2016 our executive officers, directors, and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 10% of our outstanding voting stock.  Accordingly, these stockholders may continue to have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors  perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.

We are an  emerging growth company  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.  
  We are an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.  
  In addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An  emerging growth company  can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to  opt out  of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.  
  Raising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 
  To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted.  For example, on April 7, 2015, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-203282), (the "Shelf Registration Statement"), covering the offering of up to $150 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts and units. The Shelf Registration Statement included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $30.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time in "at the market" offerings pursuant to a Common Stock Sales Agreement entered into with Cowen and Company, LLC (the "Sales Agreement") on April 7, 2015. Through September 30, 2016, we have sold   1,105,549   shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement, at a weighted-average price of approximately   $4.82   per share for aggregate gross proceeds of   $5.3 million  . As of September 30, 2016, approximately   $144.7 million   in securities remained unissued under the Shelf Registration Statement, including up to   $24.7 million   of common stock available to be sold under the Sales Agreement, subject to certain conditions specified therein. 
  In June 2016, the Company issued   7,999,996   shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase   1,999,999   shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of   $25.4 million   in connection with the Private Placement. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other restrictions, limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. 
  Future sales by our existing holders of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.  
  If our existing stockholders or holders of our options or warrants sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. As of September 30, 2016, we have outstanding a total of 27,451,400 shares of common stock.  
  In addition, based on the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under our Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") or subject to outstanding awards or available for issuance under our 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (our "2014 Plan"), our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (our "Inducement Plan") and our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (our "ESPP"), in each case, as of September 30, 2016,   5,169,097   shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding awards, outstanding but subject to vesting, or reserved for future issuance under our 2003 Plan, 2014 Plan, Inducement Plan or ESPP will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules. We have filed registration statements permitting shares of common stock issued in the future pursuant to the 2003 Plan, 2014 Plan, Inducement Plan or ESPP to be freely resold by plan participants in the public market and, for shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates, subject to compliance with Rule 144. The 2014 Plan and ESPP also contain a provision for the annual increase of the number of shares reserved for issuance under such plan, which shares we also intend to register in the future as such annual increases occurs. If the shares we may issue from time to time  

Table of Contents  

under the 2003 Plan, 2014 Plan, the Inducement Plan or ESPP are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, by the award recipient in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.  
  As of November 3, 2016, certain holders of 1,746,461 shares of our common stock and warrants exercisable for 30,024 shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares purchased by affiliates. Sales of such shares could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.  
  Provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for you to change management.  
  Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:  
             
    a classified board of directors so that not all directors are elected at one time;  
                
    a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;  
                
    no cumulative voting in the election of directors;  
                
    the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;  
                
    a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or, in the absence of a chief executive officer, the president;  
                
    an advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations;  
                
    directors may not be removed without cause and may only be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock with the power to vote in the election of directors;  
                
    the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and  
                
    a requirement of approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our capital stock with the power to vote to amend any bylaws by stockholder action, or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation.  
     In addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% or more of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will specify that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies  certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.  
  Provisions in our charter and other provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  
  We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future; as a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.  

Table of Contents  

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.  
  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
  The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

(a) Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities 
  None. 
  (b) Use of Proceeds 
  On March 17, 2014, we closed our IPO and issued 6,900,000 shares of our common stock at an initial offering price of $12.00 per share. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-193559), which was declared effective by the SEC on March 11, 2014, and a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-194494), which was effective immediately upon filing on March 11, 2014. No additional shares were registered. The joint book-running managers for the IPO were Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC. The aggregate offering price to the public for the shares sold in the IPO was $82.8 million. We received net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $73.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $5.8 million and expenses of approximately $3.1 million payable by us. None of the expenses associated with the IPO were paid to directors, officers, persons owning 10% or more of any class of equity securities, or to their associates, or to our affiliates. 
  In June 2014, we repaid our loans with Oxford and Silicon Valley Bank. None of such payments were direct or indirect payments to any of our directors or officers or their associates, to persons owning 10% or more of our capital stock, or to any of our affiliates. 
  Other than as described above, there have been no material changes in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant fails to give Landlord written notice of any such latent defects described in clause (B) hereinabove within six (6) months after the Lease Commencement Date, then the correction of any such latent defects shall, subject to Landlord's repair obligations in Section 7.2 hereof (and to the extent such correction is a responsibility of Tenant pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof), be Tenant's responsibility at Tenant's sole cost and expense.  Pursuant to Civil Code Section 1938, Landlord states that, as of the date hereof, the Premises has not undergone inspection by a Certified Access Specialist ("  CASp  ") to determine whether the Premises meet all applicable construction-related accessibility standards under California Civil Code Section 55.53.  Tenant also acknowledges that, except as otherwise  expressly set forth in this Lease, neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any representation or warranty with respect to the Premises, the Building, or the Project or their condition, or with respect to the suitability thereof for the conduct of Tenant's business (including, but not limited to, any zoning/conditional use permit requirements which shall be Tenant's responsibility and Tenant's failure to obtain any such zoning/use permits (if any are required) shall not affect Tenant's obligations under this Lease).  Except as otherwise provided above and in the Tenant Work Letter, the taking of possession of the Premises by Tenant shall conclusively establish that the Premises (including the Tenant Improvements therein), the Building and the Project were at such time complete and in good, sanitary and satisfactory condition and without any obligation on Landlord's part to make any alterations, upgrades or improvements thereto. 

1.3      Rentable Square Feet  .  The parties agree that the rentable square feet of the Premises is as set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.2 of the Summary, and shall not be changed except in connection with a change in the physical size of the Premises, the Building or the Project.  The rentable square feet of Building is subject to verification from time to time by Landlord's planner/designer and such verification shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.3.  If Landlord's planner/designer determines that the Building rentable square footage amount shall be different from those set forth in this Lease, all amounts, percentages and figures appearing or referred to in this Lease based upon such adjusted incorrect rentable square footage contained therein (including, without limitation, Tenant's Share) shall be revised accordingly and an amendment to this Lease shall be signed by the parties to reflect such modification; provided, however, that unless there is a physical change in the size of the Building, Tenant's Share shall not be increased on account of such remeasurement. 
  1.4      Right of First Refusal  .  Commencing as of the date hereof and continuing until the last day of the sixtieth (60   th   ) month anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date ("  Right of First Refusal Period  "), Tenant shall have an ongoing (subject to the terms hereof) right of first refusal with respect to (i) space contiguous to the Fourth Floor Premises, and (ii) the entire space located on the fifth (5   th   ) floor of the Building (collectively, the "  First Refusal Space  ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) the lease term for Tenant's lease of the First Refusal Space pursuant to Tenant's exercise of such first refusal right of Tenant shall commence only following the expiration or earlier termination of a lease pertaining to the First Refusal Space, either existing on the date of this Lease, or entered into following Tenant's waiver of its Right of First Refusal (collectively "  Superior Leases  "), including any renewal or extension of any such leases pursuant to a renewal option contained therein upon execution and (ii) such first refusal right shall be subordinate and secondary to all rights of expansion, first refusal, first offer or similar rights granted to the tenant of any Superior Lease (collectively, "  ROFR Superior Rights  ").  Tenant's right of first refusal shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.4.  Landlord acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date hereof, there are no ROFR Superior Rights encumbering the First Refusal Space. 
  1.4.1      Procedure for Refusal  .  Landlord shall notify Tenant (the "  First Refusal Notice  ") when Landlord receives a bona fide offer from a prospective third party tenant that Landlord is willing to accept for the First Refusal Space and/or when Landlord intends to submit a bona fide counteroffer which Landlord would be willing to accept (in each case where no holder of a ROFR Superior Right desires to lease such space).  The economic terms and conditions of Tenant's lease of such First Refusal Space shall be as provided in Landlord's First Refusal Notice ("  First Refusal Economic Terms  "). 
  1.4.2      Procedure for Acceptance  .  If Tenant wishes to exercise Tenant's right of first refusal with respect to the space described in the First Refusal Notice, then within five (5) business days (in the event the First Refusal Notice pertains to space on the fourth (4   th   ) floor) or three (3) business days (in the event the First Refusal Notice pertains to space on the fifth (5   th   ) floor) after delivery of the First Refusal Notice to Tenant ("  Election Date  "), Tenant shall deliver an unconditional, irrevocable notice to Landlord of Tenant's exercise of its right of first refusal with respect to the entire space described in the First Refusal Notice and on the First Refusal Economic Terms contained therein.  If Tenant does not exercise its right of first refusal within the applicable time period (on all of the First Refusal Economic Terms), then Landlord shall be free to lease the space described in the First Refusal Notice to anyone to whom Landlord desires on any terms Landlord desires and Tenant's right of first refusal with respect to the space described in the First Refusal Space shall, notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, automatically terminate and this Section 1.4 shall be deemed null and void and of no further force or effect.  If Tenant does not exercise its right of first refusal within the applicable time period (on all of the First Refusal Economic Terms), then Landlord shall, for a period of six (6) months, be free to lease the space described in the First Refusal Notice to anyone to whom Landlord desires on any terms Landlord desires; provided, however, that if Landlord intends to enter into a lease upon First Refusal Economic Terms which are, in the aggregate, materially more favorable to a prospective tenant than those First Refusal Economic Terms proposed by Landlord in the First Refusal Notice to Tenant, then Landlord shall first deliver written notice to Tenant ("  Second Chance Notice  ") providing Tenant with the opportunity to lease the First Refusal Space on such more favorable First Refusal Economic Terms.  For purposes hereof, First Refusal Economic Terms shall be materially more favorable to a third party if such First Refusal Economic Terms reflect a net effective rental rate (including any rent abatement and Tenant Improvement costs/allowance and any other economic concessions) less than ninety percent (90%) of the net effective rental rate for such First Refusal Space as those proposed by Landlord in the First Refusal Notice to Tenant.  Tenant's failure to elect to lease the First Refusal Space upon such more favorable First Refusal  

Economic Terms by written notice to Landlord within three (3) business days after Tenant's receipt of such Second Chance Notice from Landlord shall be deemed to constitute Tenant's election not to lease such space upon such more favorable First Refusal Economic Terms, in which case Landlord shall be entitled to lease such space to any third (3rd) party on any terms Landlord desires.  Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, in no event shall Landlord be obligated to provide Tenant with a Second Chance Notice if, at the time Landlord would otherwise be obligated to provide such Second Chance Notice to Tenant, the prospective third party tenant has an S P credit rating equal to or greater than "BBB"; provided, however, in the event that Tenant's S P credit rating is "BBB" or better, then the S P credit rating of such prospective third party tenant shall not affect Landlord's obligation to provide Tenant with the Second Chance Notice (and Landlord shall provide such Second Chance Notice to Tenant in the event the First Refusal Economic Terms are materially favorable to such third party tenant than the First Refusal Economic Term offered to Tenant).'  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant must elect to exercise its right of first refusal, if at all, with respect to all of the space comprising the First Refusal Space offered by Landlord to Tenant at any particular time, and Tenant may not elect to lease only a portion thereof or object to any of the First Refusal Economic Terms. 
  1.4.3      Construction of First Refusal Space  .  Tenant shall take the First Refusal Space in its "As-Is" condition (except as otherwise provided in the First Refusal Notice), and Tenant shall be entitled to construct improvements in the First Refusal Space at Tenant's expense, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 8 of this Lease.  
  1.4.4      Lease of First Refusal Space  .  If Tenant timely exercises Tenant's right to lease the First Refusal Space as set forth herein, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment adding such First Refusal Space to this Lease upon the First Refusal Economic Terms set forth in Landlord's First Refusal Notice and upon the same non-economic terms and conditions as applicable to the Premises then leased by Tenant under this Lease.  Tenant shall commence payment of rent for the First Refusal Space and the Lease Term of the First Refusal Space shall commence upon the date as provided in the First Refusal Notice.  The Lease Term for the First Refusal Space shall be as provided in the First Refusal Economic Terms. 
  1.4.5      No Defaults  .  The rights contained in this Section 1.4 shall be personal to the original Tenant executing this Lease and any Affiliate Assignee ("  Original Tenant  ") and any Affiliate Assignee, and may only be exercised by the Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee (and not any other assignee, sublessee or other transferee of the Original Tenant's interest (or Affiliate Assignee's interest) in this Lease) if the Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee (together with any subtenant of a Permitted Transfer) actually occupies at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the entire Premises then leased by Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee as of the date of Tenant's exercise of its right of first refusal.  In addition, at Landlord's option and in addition to Landlord's other remedies set forth in this Lease, at law and/or in equity, Tenant shall not have the right to lease the First Refusal Space as provided in this Section 1.4 if, as of the date of the First Refusal Notice, or, at Landlord's option, as of the scheduled date of delivery of such First Refusal Space to Tenant, Tenant is in default under this Lease beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods or if Tenant has previously been in default beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods under this Lease more than once in the previous twelve (12) months. 
  1.5      Right of First Offer  .  Commencing as of the expiration of the Right of First Refusal Period and continuing throughout the initial Lease Term (not including the Option Term), Tenant shall have an ongoing (subject to the terms hereof) right of first offer to Lease the First Refusal Space (which shall be referred to herein as "  First Offer Space  " for purposes of this Section 1.5).  Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) such first offer right of Tenant shall become effective only following the expiration or earlier termination of any existing lease pertaining to the First Offer Space, including any renewal or extension of such existing or future lease, whether or not such renewal or extension is pursuant to an express written provision in such lease, and regardless of whether any such renewal or extension is consummated pursuant to a lease amendment or a new lease, and (ii) Tenant's first offer right shall be subordinate and secondary to all currently existing rights of expansion, first refusal, first offer or similar rights previously existing as of the date of this Lease and granted to (A) the tenants of any existing leases and (B) any other tenant of the Project (the rights described in items (i) and (ii), above to be known collectively as "  ROFO     Superior Rights  ").  Tenant's right of first offer shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.5.  Landlord acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date hereof, there are no ROFO Superior Rights encumbering the First Offer Space. 

1.5.1      Procedure for Offer  .  Landlord shall notify Tenant (the "  First Offer Notice  ") from time to time when Landlord determines that Landlord shall commence the marketing of any First Offer Space because such space shall become available for lease to third parties, where no holder of a ROFO Superior Right desires to lease such space.  The First Offer Notice shall describe the space so offered to Tenant and shall set forth Landlord's proposed material economic terms and conditions applicable to Tenant's lease of such space (collectively, the "  First Offer     Economic Terms  "), including the proposed term of lease and the proposed rent payable for the First Offer Space.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord's obligation to deliver the First Offer Notice shall not apply during the last twelve (12) months of the initial Term unless Tenant has delivered an Exercise Notice to Landlord pursuant to Rider No. 1. 
  1.5.2      Procedure for Acceptance  .  If Tenant wishes to exercise Tenant's right of first offer with respect to the space described in the First Offer Notice, then within five (5) business days (in the event the First Offer Notice pertains to space on the fourth (4   th   ) floor) or three (3) business days (in the event the First Offer Notice pertains to space on the fifth (5   th   ) floor) after delivery of the First Offer Notice to Tenant, Tenant shall deliver an unconditional irrevocable notice to Landlord of Tenant's exercise of its right of first offer with respect to the entire space described in the First Offer Notice, and the First Offer Economic Terms shall be as set forth in the First Offer Notice.  If Tenant does not unconditionally exercise its right of first offer within the applicable time period, then Landlord shall be free to lease the space described in the First Offer Notice to anyone to whom Landlord desires on any terms Landlord desires and Tenant's right of first offer shall terminate as to the First Offer Space described in the First Offer Notice but shall be deemed reinstated upon the expiration or sooner termination of any lease for such First Offer Space entered into by Landlord and a third party tenant.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant must elect to exercise its right of first offer, if at all, with respect to all of the space offered by Landlord to Tenant at any particular time, and Tenant may not elect to lease only a portion thereof. 
  1.5.3      Construction of First Offer Space  .  Tenant shall take the First Offer Space in its "as-is" condition (except as otherwise provided in the First Offer Economic Terms), and Tenant shall be entitled to construct improvements in the First Offer Space in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of this Lease. 
  1.5.4      Lease of First Offer Space  .  If Tenant timely and properly exercises Tenant's right to lease the First Offer Space as set forth herein, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment adding such First Offer Space to this Lease upon the same non-economic terms and conditions as applicable to the initial Premises, and the economic terms and conditions as provided in this Section 1.5.  Unless otherwise specified in the First Offer Economic Terms, Tenant shall commence payment of rent for the First Offer Space as provided in the First Offer Economic Terms.  The Lease Term for the First Offer Space shall be as provided in the First Offer Economic Terms. 
  1.5.5      No Defaults  .  The rights contained in this Section 1.5 shall be personal to the Original Tenant and any Affiliate Assignee and may only be exercised by the Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee (and not any other assignee or sublessee of the Original Tenant's interest (or Affiliate Assignee's interest) in this Lease) if the Original Tenant (or such Affiliate Assignee) (together with any subtenant of a Permitted Transfer) actually occupies at least seventy-five percent (75%) the entire Premises then leased by Original Tenant or such Affiliate Assignee as of the date of the First Offer Notice.  Tenant shall not have the right to lease First Offer Space as provided in this Section 1.5 if, as of the date of the First Offer Notice, or, at Landlord's option, as of the scheduled date of delivery of such First Offer Space to Tenant, Tenant is in default under this Lease beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods or if Tenant has previously been in default beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods under this Lease more than once in the preceding twelve (12) months. 
   
  ARTICLE 2       LEASE TERM 
  The terms and provisions of this Lease shall be effective as of the date of this Lease except for the provisions of this Lease relating to the payment of Rent.  The term of this Lease (the "  Lease Term  ") shall be as set forth in Section 7.1 of the Summary and shall commence on the date (the "  Lease Commencement Date  ") set forth in Section 7.2 of the Summary (subject, however, to the terms of the Tenant Work Letter), and shall terminate on the date (the "  Lease  

Expiration Date  ") set forth in Section 7.3 of the Summary, unless this Lease is sooner terminated as expressly provided in this Lease.  For purposes of this Lease, the term "  Lease Year  " shall mean each consecutive twelve (12) month period during the Lease Term, provided that the last Lease Year shall end on the Lease Expiration Date.  If Landlord does not deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant Ready for Occupancy on or before the anticipated Lease Commencement Date (as set forth in Section 7.2(ii) of the Summary), Landlord shall not be subject to any liability nor shall the validity of this Lease nor the obligations of Tenant hereunder be affected; provided that if Landlord does not deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant Ready for Occupancy on or before that date ("  Outside Date  ") which is the sixtieth (60   th   ) day following the Target Completion Date (such Target Completion Date is set forth in the Tenant Improvement Schedule attached to the Tenant Work Letter as Exhibit B-2) with such Target Completion Date (and Outside Date) to be subject to extension for any Tenant Delays in accordance with Section 6 of the Work Letter) and any Force Majeure delays (as defined in Section 24.17 hereof), then Tenant shall receive one (1) Free Rent Day (as hereinafter defined) for each day that elapses from and after the Outside Date, up to a  maximum of thirty (30) days, and Tenant shall receive two (2) Free Rent Days for each day that elapses from and after the thirty-first (31   st   ) day following the Outside Date.  A "  Free Rent Day  " means a day for which Tenant has no obligation to pay Base Rent after the Lease Commencement Date.      In addition, in the event that Landlord has not delivered possession of the Premises to Tenant Ready For Occupancy by that date which is seventy-five (75) days after the Outside Date (which shall be deemed extended by the number of days of Tenant Delays or "Force Majeure" delays), then the sole remedy of Tenant shall be the right to deliver a written notice to Landlord (the "  Outside Date Termination Notice  ") electing to terminate this Lease effective upon receipt of the Outside Date Termination Notice by Landlord (the "  Effective Date  ").  The Outside Date Termination Notice must be delivered by Tenant to Landlord, if at all, not later than five (5) business days after the expiration of such seventy-five (75) day period.  Upon termination of the Lease pursuant to this Article 2, Landlord shall return all sums deposited by Tenant (and the L C, if applicable) and the parties shall be relieved of all further obligations under this Lease except for those obligations under this Lease which expressly survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.  If the Lease Commencement Date is a date which is other than the anticipated Lease Commencement Date set forth in Section 7.2(ii) of the Summary, then, following the Lease Commencement Date, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant an amendment to lease in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit C  , attached hereto, setting forth, among other things, the Lease Commencement Date, the Lease Expiration Date and a revised rent schedule in the event Tenant utilizes any Additional Allowance monies, and Tenant shall execute and return such amendment to Landlord within ten (10) business days after Tenant's receipt thereof.  If Tenant fails to execute and return the amendment within such 10-business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved and confirmed the dates set forth therein, provided that such deemed approval shall not relieve Tenant of its obligation to execute and return the amendment.   
   
  ARTICLE 3       BASE RENT 
  Tenant shall pay, without notice or demand, to Landlord at the address set forth in Section 3 of the Summary, or at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing, in currency or a check for currency which, at the time of payment, is legal tender for private or public debts in the United States of America, base rent ("  Base Rent  ") as set forth in Section 8 of the Summary, payable in equal monthly installments as set forth in Section 8 of the Summary in advance on or before the first day of each and every month during the Lease Term, without any setoff or deduction whatsoever.  Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an amount equal to the Base Rent payable by Tenant for the Premises for the first (1   st   ) full month of the Lease Term (  i.e.  , $226,166.40).  If any rental payment date (including the Lease Commencement Date) falls on a day of the month other than the first day of such month or if any rental payment is for a period which is shorter than one month, then the rental for any such fractional month shall be a proportionate amount of a full calendar month's rental based on the proportion that the number of days in such fractional month bears to the number of days in the calendar month during which such fractional month occurs.  All other payments or adjustments required to be made under the terms of this Lease that require proration on a time basis shall be prorated on the same basis. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and so long as Tenant is not then in default under this Lease (beyond the expiration of all applicable notice and cure periods), Landlord hereby agrees (i) to abate  Tenant's obligation to pay one hundred percent (100%) of Tenant's monthly Base Rent for the Fourth Floor Premises for the first twelve (12) full months of the initial Lease Term, and (ii) to abate Tenant's obligation to pay fifty percent (50%)  

of Tenant's monthly Base Rent for the Third Floor Premises for the first twelve (12) full months of the initial Lease Term (collectively the "  Abated Rent  ").  During such abatement period, Tenant shall still be responsible for the payment of all of its other monetary obligations under this Lease.  In the event of a default by Tenant under the terms of this Lease that results in early termination pursuant to the provisions of Article 19 of this Lease, then as a part of the recovery set forth in Article 19 of this Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to the recovery of the unamortized amount of the Abated Rent that was abated under the provisions of this Article 3. 
   
  ARTICLE 4       ADDITIONAL RENT 
  4.1      Additional Rent  .

  (h)    the wages and benefits of any employee who does not devote substantially all of his or her employed time to the Project unless such wages and benefits are prorated to reflect time spent on operating and managing the Project vis-a-vis time spent on matters unrelated to operating and managing the Project; provided, that in no event shall Operating Expenses for purposes of this Lease include wages and/or benefits attributable to personnel above the level of Project or portfolio manager; 
  (i)    overhead and profit increment paid to the Landlord or to subsidiaries or affiliates of the Landlord for services in the Project to the extent the same exceeds the costs of such services rendered by qualified, first-class unaffiliated third parties on a competitive basis; 
  (j)    any compensation paid to clerks, attendants or other persons in commercial concessions operated by the Landlord, provided that any compensation paid to any concierge or parking attendants at the Project shall be includable as an Operating Expense; 
  (k)    rentals and other related expenses incurred in leasing air conditioning systems, elevators or other equipment which if purchased the cost of which would be excluded from Operating Expenses as a capital cost, except equipment not affixed to the Project which is used in providing janitorial or similar services and, further excepting from this exclusion such equipment rented or leased to remedy or ameliorate an emergency condition in the Project; 
  (l)    all costs, items and services for which Tenant or any other tenant or other occupant in the Project directly reimburses Landlord or which Landlord provides selectively to one or more tenants (other than Tenant) without reimbursement;

  (r)    insurance deductibles (as determined on a percentage basis) in excess of generally customary deductible amounts carried by landlords of the comparable buildings in South San Francisco, CA (the parties acknowledging that earthquake deductibles of twenty percent (20%) of replacement value are not in excess of generally customary deductible amounts). 
  4.2.4    "  Systems and Equipment  " shall mean any plant (including any central plant), machinery, transformers, duct work, cable, wires, and other equipment, facilities, and systems designed to supply heat, ventilation, air conditioning and humidity or any other services or utilities, or comprising or serving as any component or portion of the electrical, gas, steam, plumbing, sprinkler, communications, alarm, lab, security, or fire/life safety systems or equipment, or any other mechanical, electrical, electronic, computer or other systems or equipment which serve the Building and/or any other building in the Project in whole or in part. 
  4.2.5    "  Tax Expenses  " shall mean all federal, state, county, or local governmental or municipal taxes, fees, assessments, charges or other impositions of every kind and nature, whether general, special, ordinary or extraordinary, (including, without limitation, real estate taxes, general and special assessments, transit assessments, fees and taxes, child care subsidies, fees and/or assessments, job training subsidies, fees and/or assessments, open space fees and/or assessments, housing subsidies and/or housing fund fees or assessments, public art fees and/or assessments, leasehold taxes or taxes based upon the receipt of rent, including gross receipts or sales taxes applicable to the receipt of rent, personal property taxes imposed upon the fixtures, machinery, equipment, apparatus, systems and equipment, appurtenances, furniture and other personal property used in connection with the Project), which Landlord shall pay during any Expense Year because of or in connection with the ownership, leasing and operation of the Project or Landlord's interest therein.   
  4.2.5.1    Tax Expenses shall include, without limitation: 
  (i)    Any tax on Landlord's rent, right to rent or other income from the Project or as against Landlord's business of leasing any of the Project; 
  (ii)    Any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge in addition to, or in substitution, partially or totally, of any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge previously included within the definition of real property tax, it being acknowledged by Tenant and Landlord that Proposition 13 was adopted by the voters of the State of California in the June 1978 election ("  Proposition 13  ") and that assessments, taxes, fees, levies and charges may be imposed by governmental agencies for such services as fire protection, street, sidewalk and road maintenance, refuse removal and for other governmental services formerly provided without charge to property owners or occupants.  It is  

the intention of Tenant and Landlord that all such new and increased assessments, taxes, fees, levies, and charges and all similar assessments, taxes, fees, levies and charges be included within the definition of Tax Expenses for purposes of this Lease; 
  (iii)    Any assessment, tax, fee, levy, or charge allocable to or measured by the area of the Premises or the rent payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any gross income tax upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operating, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises, or any portion thereof; 
  (iv)    Any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge, upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party, creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises; and 
  (v)    Any reasonable expenses incurred by Landlord in attempting to protest, reduce or minimize Tax Expenses. 
  4.2.5.2    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.2.5, there shall be excluded from Tax Expenses (i) all excess profits taxes, franchise taxes, gift taxes, capital stock taxes, inheritance and succession taxes, estate taxes, federal and state net income taxes, and other taxes to the extent applicable to Landlord's net income (as opposed to rents, receipts or income attributable to operations at the Project), (ii) any items included as (or expressly excluded from) the definition of Operating Expenses, and (iii) any items paid by Tenant under Section 4.4 below. 
  4.2.6    "  Tenant's Share  " shall mean the percentage set forth in Section 9 of the Summary.  Tenant's Share was calculated by dividing the number of rentable square feet of the Premises by the total rentable square feet in the Building (as set forth in Section 9 of the Summary), and stating such amount as a percentage.  Landlord shall have the right from time to time, but only if the physical size of the Building, the Premises and/or the Project has changed, to redetermine the rentable square feet of the Premises and/or Building, and Tenant's Share shall be adjusted to reflect any such redetermination, which redetermination shall be in a manner that fairly and equitably allocates Operating Expenses among tenants of the Project.  If Tenant's Share is adjusted pursuant to the foregoing, as to the Expense Year in which such adjustment occurs, Tenant's Share for such year shall be determined on the basis of the number of days during such Expense Year that each such Tenant's Share was in effect. 
  4.2.7    "  Utilities Costs  " shall mean all actual charges for utilities for the Building and the Project (including utilities for the Other Future Building and additional buildings, if any, added to the Project during the period of time the same are included by Landlord within the Project) which Landlord shall pay during any Expense Year, including, but not limited to, the costs of water, sewer, gas and electricity, and the costs of HVAC and other utilities, including any lab utilities and central plant utilities (but excluding those charges for which tenants directly reimburse Landlord or otherwise pay directly to the utility company) as well as related fees, assessments, measurement meters and devices and surcharges.  Utilities Costs shall be calculated assuming the Building (and, during the period of time when such buildings are included by Landlord within the Project, the Other Future Building and any additional buildings, if any, added to the Project) are at least ninety-five percent (95%) occupied.  If, during all or any part of any Expense Year, Landlord shall not provide any utilities (the cost of which, if provided by Landlord, would be included in Utilities Costs) to a tenant (including Tenant) who has undertaken to provide the same instead of Landlord, Utilities Costs shall be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to the additional Utilities Costs which would reasonably have been incurred during such period by Landlord if Landlord had at its own expense provided such utilities to such tenant.  Utilities Costs shall include any costs of utilities which are allocated to the Project under any declaration, restrictive covenant, or other instrument pertaining to the sharing of costs by the Project or any portion thereof, including any covenants, conditions or restrictions now or hereafter recorded against or affecting the Project.  Upon Tenant's written request, Landlord shall provide Tenant with backup documentation pertaining to Landlord's allocation of Utilities Costs.  Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to allocate Utilities Costs on an equitable basis. 

4.3      Calculation and Payment of Additional Rent  . 
  4.3.1      Payment of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs  .  For each Expense Year ending or commencing within the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the following, which payment shall be made in the manner set forth in Section 4.3.2 below: (i) Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses allocated to the Building pursuant to Section 4.3.4 below; plus (ii) Tenant's Share of Tax Expenses allocated to the Building pursuant to Section 4.3.4 below; plus (iii) Tenant's Share of Utilities Costs allocated to the Building pursuant to Section 4.3.4 below. 
  4.3.2      Statement of Actual Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs and Payment by Tenant  .  Landlord shall endeavor to give to Tenant on or before the first (1   st   ) day of April (or as soon thereafter as is commercially reasonable) following the end of each Expense Year, a statement (the "  Statement  ") which shall state the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs incurred or accrued for such preceding Expense Year that are allocated to the Building pursuant to Section 4.3.4 below, and which shall indicate therein Tenant's Share thereof.  Within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of the Statement for each Expense Year ending during the Lease Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the full amount of the Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs for such Expense Year, less the amounts, if any, paid during such Expense Year as the Estimated Expenses as defined in and pursuant to Section 4.3.3 below.  If any Statement reflects that Tenant has overpaid Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses and/or Tenant's Share of Tax Expenses and/or Tenant's Share of Utilities Costs for such Expense Year, then Landlord shall, at Landlord's option, either (i) remit such overpayment to Tenant within thirty (30) days after such applicable Statement is delivered to Tenant, or (ii) credit such overpayment toward the additional Rent next due and payable to Tenant under this Lease.  The failure of Landlord to timely furnish the Statement for any Expense Year shall not prejudice Landlord from enforcing its rights under this Article 4.  Even though the Lease Term has expired and Tenant has vacated the Premises, if the Statement for the Expense Year in which this Lease terminates reflects that Tenant has overpaid and/or underpaid  Tenant's Share of the Operating Expenses and/or Tenant's Share of Tax Expenses and/or Tenant's Share of Utilities Costs for such Expense Year, then within thirty (30) days after Landlord's delivery of such Statement to Tenant, Landlord shall refund to Tenant any such overpayment, or Tenant shall pay to Landlord any such underpayment, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Tenant shall not be responsible for Tenant's Share of any Operating Expenses attributable to any Expense Year which was first billed to Tenant more than eighteen (18) months after the date (the "  Cutoff Date  ") which is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the applicable Expense Year or (ii) the Lease Expiration Date, except that Tenant shall be responsible for Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses levied by any governmental authority or by any public utility company at any time following the applicable Cutoff Date which are attributable to any Expense Year occurring prior to such Cutoff Date, so long as Landlord delivers to Tenant a bill and supplemental Statement for such amounts within eighteen (18) months following Landlord's receipt of the applicable bill therefor.  The provisions of this Section 4.3.2 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. 
  4.3.3      Statement of Estimated Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs  .  On or before the first (1st) day of January (or as soon thereafter as is commercially reasonable) following the end of each Expense Year, Landlord shall endeavor to give Tenant a yearly expense estimate statement (the "  Estimate Statement  ") which shall set forth Landlord's reasonable estimate (the "  Estimate  ") of  the total amount of Tenant's Share of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs allocated to the Building pursuant to Section 4.3.4 below for the then-current Expense Year shall be, and which shall indicate therein Tenant's Share thereof (the "  Estimated Expenses  ").  The failure of Landlord to timely furnish the Estimate Statement for any Expense Year shall not preclude Landlord from enforcing its rights to collect any Estimated Expenses under this Article 4.  Following Landlord's delivery of the Estimate Statement for the then-current Expense Year, Tenant shall pay, with its next installment of Base Rent due, a fraction of the Estimated Expenses for the then-current Expense Year (reduced by any amounts paid pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 4.3.3).  Such fraction shall have as its numerator the number of months which have elapsed in such current Expense Year to the month of such payment, both months inclusive, and shall have twelve (12) as its denominator.  Until a new Estimate Statement is furnished, Tenant shall pay monthly, with the monthly Base Rent installments, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the total Estimated Expenses set forth in the previous Estimate Statement delivered by Landlord to Tenant. 

4.3.4      Allocation of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs to Building  .  The parties acknowledge that the Building is part of a multi-building commercial project consisting of the Building and such other buildings as Landlord (and/or any other owners of the Project) may elect to construct and include as part of the Project from time to time and any such other buildings (including the Other Future Building) are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as the "  Other Buildings  "), and that certain of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Project (  i.e.   the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs) shall be shared among the Building and/or such Other Buildings (if any), while certain other costs and expenses which are solely attributable to the Building and such Other Buildings, as applicable, shall be allocated directly to the Building and the Other Buildings, respectively.  Accordingly, as set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 above, Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs are determined annually for the Project as a whole, and a portion of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs, which portion shall be determined by Landlord on an equitable basis (which shall take into account whether any tenants of other buildings within the Project consume more services or utilities on a per rentable square foot basis than Tenant does, and make adjustments to prevent an inequitable burden being placed on Tenant as a consequence), shall be allocated to the Building (as opposed to the tenants of the Other Buildings), and such portion so allocated shall be the amount of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs payable with respect to the Building upon which Tenant's Share shall be calculated.  Such portion of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs allocated to the Building shall include all Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs which are attributable solely to the Building, and an equitable portion of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs attributable to the Project as a whole.  As an example of such allocation with respect to Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs, it is anticipated that Landlord (and/or any other owners of the Project) may receive separate tax bills which separately assess the improvements component of Tax Expenses for each building in the Project and/or Landlord may receive separate utilities bills from the utilities companies identifying the Utilities Costs for certain of the utilities costs directly incurred by each such building (as measured by separate meters installed for each such building), and such separately assessed Tax Expenses and separately metered Utilities Costs shall be calculated for and allocated separately to each such applicable building.  In addition, in the event Landlord (and/or any other owners of the Project) elect to subdivide certain common area portions of the Project such as landscaping, public and private streets, driveways, walkways, courtyards, plazas, transportation facilitation areas and/or accessways into a separate parcel or parcels of land (and/or separately convey all or any of such parcels to a common area association to own, operate and/or maintain same), the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs for such common area parcels of land may be aggregated and then reasonably allocated by Landlord to the Building     and such Other Buildings on an equitable basis as Landlord (and/or any applicable covenants, conditions and restrictions for any such common area association) shall provide from time to time. 
  4.4      Taxes and Other Charges for Which Tenant Is Directly Responsible  .  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for all taxes or assessments required to be paid by Landlord (except to the extent included in Tax Expenses by Landlord), excluding state, local and federal personal or corporate income taxes measured by the net income of Landlord from all sources and estate and inheritance taxes, whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto, when: 
  4.4.1    said taxes are measured by or reasonably attributable to the cost or value of Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property located in the Premises, or by the cost or value of any leasehold improvements made in or to the Premises by or for Tenant, to the extent the cost or value of such leasehold improvements exceeds the cost or value of a building standard build-out as determined by Landlord regardless of whether title to such improvements shall be vested in Tenant or Landlord; 
  4.4.2    said taxes are assessed upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion of the Project; or 
  4.4.3    said taxes are assessed upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises. 
  4.5      Late Charges  .  If any installment of Rent or any other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or Landlord's designee by the due date therefor, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, following receipt of a  

written notice, a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due plus any reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's failure to pay Rent and/or other charges when due hereunder, provided, however, that Landlord will waive the imposition of the late charge for the first late payment of rent in any one (1) calendar year.  The late charge shall be deemed Additional Rent and the right to require it shall be in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies hereunder, at law and/or in equity and shall not be construed as liquidated damages or as limiting Landlord's remedies in any manner.  In addition to the late charge described above, any Rent or other amounts owing hereunder which are not paid by the date that they are due shall thereafter bear interest from the date of Landlord's notice to Tenant until paid at a rate (the "  Interest Rate  ") equal to the lesser of (i) the "Prime Rate" or "Reference Rate" announced from time to time by the Bank of America (or such reasonable comparable national banking institution as selected by Landlord in the event Bank of America ceases to exist or publish a Prime Rate or Reference Rate), plus four percent (4%), or (ii) the highest rate permitted by applicable law. 
  4.6    Audit Rights.  Tenant shall have the right, at Tenant's cost, after reasonable notice to Landlord, to have Tenant's authorized employees or agents inspect, at Landlord's main corporate office during normal business hours, Landlord's books, records and supporting documents concerning the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs set forth in any Statement delivered by Landlord to Tenant for a particular Expense Year pursuant to Section 4.3.2 above; provided, however, Tenant shall have no right to conduct such inspection or object to or otherwise dispute the amount of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs set forth in any such Statement, unless Tenant notifies Landlord of such inspection objection and dispute, completes such inspection within six (6) months immediately following Landlord's delivery of a Statement (the "  Review Period  "); provided, further, that notwithstanding any such timely inspection, objection, dispute, and/or audit, and as a condition precedent to Tenant's exercise of its right of inspection, objection, dispute, and/or audit as set forth in this Section 4.6, Tenant shall not be permitted to withhold payment of, and Tenant shall timely pay to Landlord, the full amounts as required by the provisions of this Article 4 in accordance with such Statement.  However, such payment may be made under protest pending the outcome of any audit.  In connection with any such inspection by Tenant, Landlord and Tenant shall reasonably cooperate with each other so that such inspection can be performed pursuant to a mutually acceptable schedule, in an expeditious manner and without undue interference with Landlord's operation and management of the Project.  If after such inspection and/or request for documentation, Tenant disputes the amount of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs set forth in the Statement, Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation, within the Review Period, to cause an independent certified public accountant which is not paid on a contingency basis and which is mutually approved by Landlord and Tenant (the "  Accountant  ") to complete an audit of Landlord's books and records to determine the proper amount of the Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs incurred and amounts payable by Tenant for the Expense Year which is the subject of such Statement.  Such audit by the Accountant shall be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant.  If Landlord and Tenant cannot mutually agree as to the identity of the Accountant within thirty (30) days after Tenant notifies Landlord that Tenant desires an audit to be performed, then the Accountant shall be one of the "Big 4" accounting firms selected by Landlord, which is not paid on a contingency basis and is not, and has not been, otherwise employed or retained by Landlord.  If such audit reveals that Landlord has over-charged Tenant, then within thirty (30) days after the results of such audit are made available to Landlord, Landlord shall reimburse to Tenant the amount of such over-charge.  If the audit reveals that the Tenant was under-charged, then within thirty (30) days after the results of such audit are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall reimburse to Landlord the amount of such under-charge.  Tenant agrees to pay the cost of such audit unless it is subsequently determined that Landlord's original Statement which was the subject of such audit was in error to Tenant's disadvantage by five percent (5%) or more of the total Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs which was the subject of the audit (in which case Landlord shall pay the cost of such audit).  The payment by Tenant of any amounts pursuant to this Article 4 shall not preclude Tenant from questioning the correctness of any Statement provided by Landlord at any time during the Review Period, but the failure of Tenant to object thereto, conduct and complete its inspection and have the Accountant conduct and complete the audit as described above prior to the expiration of the Review Period shall be conclusively deemed Tenant's approval of the Statement in question and the amount of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs shown thereon, subject to Tenant's right to review Statements for the prior twelve (12) months.  In connection with any inspection and/or audit conducted by Tenant pursuant to this Section 4.6, Tenant agrees to keep, and to cause all of Tenant's employees and consultants and the Accountant to keep, all of Landlord's books and records and the audit, and all information pertaining thereto and the results thereof, strictly confidential, and in connection therewith, Tenant shall cause such employees, consultants and the Accountant to execute such reasonable confidentiality agreements as Landlord may require prior to conducting any such inspections and/or audits.

  5.1      Use  .  Tenant may use the Premises for the Permitted Uses described in Section 13 of the Summary, and Tenant shall not use or permit the Premises to be used for any other purpose or purposes whatsoever.  Tenant shall not use, or suffer or permit any person or persons to use, the Premises or any part thereof for any use or purpose contrary to the provisions of   Exhibit D  , attached hereto, or in violation of the laws of the United States of America, the state in which the Project is located, or the ordinances, regulations or requirements of the local municipal or county governing body or other lawful authorities having jurisdiction over the Project.  Tenant shall comply with the Rules and Regulations and all recorded covenants, conditions, and restrictions, and the provisions of all ground or underlying leases, now or hereafter affecting the Project, including but not limited to, (i) that certain Declaration of Reciprocal Easements, Covenants and Restrictions of Centennial Towers, dated as of May 5, 2008, and recorded in the Official Records of San Mateo County, California ("  Official Records  ") on September 18, 2008 as Instrument No. 2008 105136, and (ii) that certain Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Centennial Towers, dated March 27, 2009 and recorded in the Official Records on April 3, 2009, as Instrument No. 2009 038658, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of Centennial Towers, dated as of April 20, 2010, and recorded in the Official Records on May 12, 2010, as Instrument No. 2010 051876 (collectively, the "  CC Rs  "), as the same may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time;   provided   that any such amendments, restatements, supplements or modifications as well as any reciprocal easement agreements which be entered into by and between Landlord and any other owner of the Project, do not materially modify Tenant's rights or obligations hereunder. 
  5.2      Hazardous Materials  . 
  5.2.1      Definitions  :  As used in this Lease, the following terms have the following meanings: 
  (a)    "  Environmental Law  " means any past, present or future federal, state or local statutory or common law, or any regulation, ordinance, code, plan, order, permit, grant, franchise, concession, restriction or agreement issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder, relating to (a) the environment, human health or safety, including, without limitation, emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Materials (as defined below) into the environment (including, without limitation, air, surface water, groundwater or land), or (b) the manufacture, generation, refining, processing, distribution, use, sale, treatment, receipt, storage, disposal, transport, arranging for transport, or handling of Hazardous Materials.

  5.2.2      Tenant's Obligations   Environmental Permits  .  Tenant will (i) obtain and maintain in full force and effect all Environmental Permits that may be required from time to time under any Environmental Laws applicable to Tenant or Tenant's use of the Premises and (ii) be and remain in compliance with all terms and conditions  

of all such Environmental Permits and with all other limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and timetables contained in all Environmental Laws applicable to Tenant or Tenant's use of the Premises. 
  5.2.3      Tenant's Obligations   Hazardous Materials  .  Except as expressly permitted in this Lease, Tenant agrees not to cause or permit any Hazardous Materials to be brought upon, stored, used, handled, generated, released or disposed of on, in, under or about the Premises, or any other portion of the Property by Tenant, its agents, employees, subtenants, assignees, licensees, contractors or invitees (collectively, "  Tenant's Parties  "), without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.  Landlord acknowledges that it is not the intent of this Section 5.2 to prohibit Tenant from operating its business for the Permitted Uses.  Tenant may operate its business according to the custom of Tenant's industry so long as the use or presence of Hazardous Materials is strictly and properly monitored in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws.  As a material inducement to Landlord to allow Tenant to use Hazardous Materials in connection with its business, Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord prior to the Lease Commencement Date a list identifying each type of Hazardous Material to be present at the Premises and setting forth any and all governmental approvals or permits required in connection with the presence of such Hazardous Material at the Premises (the "  Hazardous Materials List  ").  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an updated Hazardous Materials List on or prior to each annual anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date and shall also deliver an updated Hazardous Materials List after any new Hazardous Materials are brought to the Premises.  Tenant shall deliver to Landlord true and correct copies of the following documents (hereinafter referred to as the "  Documents  ") relating to the handling, storage, disposal and emission of Hazardous Materials prior to the Lease Commencement Date or, if unavailable at that time, concurrently with the receipt from or submission to any Governmental Authority:  permits, approvals, reports and correspondence, storage and management plans, notices of violations of applicable Environmental Laws, plans relating to the installation of any storage tanks to be installed in, on, under or about the Premises (provided that installation of storage tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has given Tenant its written consent to do so, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion), and all closure plans or any other documents required by any and all governmental authorities for any storage tanks installed in, on, under or about the Premises for the closure of any such storage tanks.  For each type of Hazardous Material listed, the Documents shall include (t) the chemical name, (u) the material state (e.g., solid, liquid, gas or cryogen), (v) the concentration, (w) the storage amount and storage condition (e.g., in cabinets or not in cabinets), (x) the use amount and use condition (e.g., open use or closed use), (y) the location (e.g., room number or other identification) and (z) if known, the chemical abstract service number.  Tenant shall not be required, however, to provide Landlord with any portion of the Documents containing information of a proprietary nature, which Documents, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous Materials or activities related to Hazardous Materials.  Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant agrees to promptly remove from the Premises, the Building and the Project, at its sole cost and expense, any and all Hazardous Materials, including any equipment or systems containing Hazardous Materials which are installed, brought upon, stored, used, generated or released upon, in, under or about the Premises, the Building and/or the Project or any portion thereof by Tenant or any of Tenant's Parties during the Term of this Lease.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 14, if (a) any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee of Tenant has been required by any prior landlord, lender or governmental authority to take material remedial action in connection with Hazardous Materials contaminating a property if the contamination resulted from such party's action or omission or use of the property in question or (b) any proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee is subject to a material enforcement order issued by any governmental authority in connection with the use, disposal or storage of Hazardous Materials, then it shall not be unreasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any proposed transfer, assignment or subletting (with respect to any such matter involving a proposed transferee, assignee or sublessee). 
  5.2.4      Landlord's Right to Conduct Environmental Assessment  .  At any time during the Lease Term, Landlord shall have the right to conduct an environmental assessment of the Premises (as well as any other areas in, on or about the Project that Landlord reasonably believes may have been affected adversely by Tenant's use of the Premises (collectively, the "  Affected Areas  ") in order to confirm that the Premises and the Affected Areas do not contain any Hazardous Materials in violation of applicable Environmental Laws or under conditions constituting or likely to constitute a Release of Hazardous Materials.  Such environmental assessment shall be a so-called "Phase I" assessment or such other level of investigation which shall be the standard of diligence in the purchase or lease of similar property at the time, together with any additional investigation and report which would customarily follow any discovery contained in such initial Phase I assessment (including, but not limited to, any so-called "Phase II" report).   

Such right to conduct such environmental assessment shall not be exercised more than once per calendar year unless Tenant is in default under this Section 5.2.  If the data from any environmental assessment authorized and undertaken by Landlord pursuant to this Section 5.2 indicates there has been a Release, threatened Release or other conditions with respect to Hazardous Materials on, under or emanating from the Premises and the Affected Areas that may require any investigation and/or active response action, Tenant shall, within ten (10) business days' notice, reimburse Landlord for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the assessment, otherwise such cost and expenses shall be at the sole cost of Landlord and shall not be included within Operating Expenses. 
  5.2.5      Tenant's Obligations to perform Corrective Action  .  If the data from any environmental assessment authorized and undertaken by Landlord pursuant to Section 5.2.4 indicates there has been a Release caused or permitted by Tenant, threatened Release caused or permitted by Tenant or other conditions with respect to Hazardous Materials caused or permitted by Tenant on, under or emanating from the Premises and the Affected Areas that may require any investigation and/or active response action, including without limitation active or passive remediation and monitoring or any combination of these activities ("  Corrective Action  "), Tenant shall immediately undertake Corrective Action with respect to contamination if, and to the extent, required by the governmental authority exercising jurisdiction over the matter.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant shall have no responsibility for any Hazardous Materials present in the Premises or Project as of the Lease Commencement Date or which migrate thereto through air, water or soil through no fault of Tenant or any Tenant's Parties, or are introduced by Landlord, other tenant of the Project, or any third party not under Tenant's control.  Any Corrective Action performed by Tenant will be performed with Landlord's prior written approval and in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws, at Tenant's sole cost and expense and by an environmental consulting firm (reasonably acceptable to Landlord).  Tenant may perform the Corrective Action before or after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, to the extent permitted by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over the Premises, the Building and the Project (provided, however, that any Corrective Action performed after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease shall be subject to the access fee provisions set forth below).  If Tenant undertakes or continues Corrective Action after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Landlord, upon being given forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice, may, in Landlord's sole discretion, elect (without limiting any of the Landlord's other rights and remedies under this Lease, at law and/or in equity), to require an "access fee" be paid in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Monthly Rent in effect for the last month immediately preceding the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease (prorated on the basis of the amount of rentable square footage which Landlord is unable to lease due to Tenant's Corrective Action) for such access to the Premises, the Building and the Project as may be requested by Tenant and its consultant to accomplish the Corrective Action.  Tenant or its consultant may install, inspect, maintain, replace and operate remediation equipment and conduct the Corrective Action as it considers necessary, subject to Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Tenant and Landlord shall, in good faith, cooperate with each other with respect to any Corrective Action after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of Landlord's or any third party's business on the Premises, the Building and the Project.  Landlord may, in its sole discretion, provide access until Tenant delivers evidence reasonably satisfactory to Landlord that Tenant's Corrective Action activities on the Premises and the Affected Areas satisfy applicable Environmental Laws.  It shall be reasonable for Landlord to require Tenant to deliver a "no further action" letter or substantially similar document from the applicable governmental agency, if such letter or equivalent is typically provided in such circumstances.  If Landlord desires to situate a tenant in the Premises, the Building and the Project for a Permitted Use and remediation of the Premises and the Affected Areas is ongoing, Landlord shall be deemed to be unable to use the Premises, the Building and the Project in the way Landlord reasonably desires and Tenant shall be obligated to continue paying the access fee until such time as Environmental Laws would permit Landlord to situate said tenant in the Premises, the Building and/or the Project for the Permitted Used.  Tenant agrees to install, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, screening around its remediation equipment so as to protect the aesthetic appeal of the Premises, the Building and the Project. Tenant also agrees to use reasonable efforts to locate its remediation and/or monitoring equipment, if any (subject to the requirements of Tenant's consultant and governmental agencies with jurisdiction over the Premises, the Building and the Project) in a location which will allow Landlord, to the extent reasonably practicable, the ability to lease the Premises, the Building and the Project to a subsequent user.   
  5.2.6      Tenant's Duty to Notify Landlord Regarding Releases  .  Tenant agrees to promptly notify Landlord of any Release of Hazardous Materials in the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Project which Tenant becomes aware of during the Term of this Lease, whether caused by Tenant or any Tenant Parties.  In the event o 

f any release of Hazardous Materials caused or permitted by Tenant or any of Tenant's Parties, Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, to immediately take all reasonable steps Landlord deems necessary or appropriate to remediate such Release in accordance with Environmental Laws and implement a program to prevent any similar future release to the satisfaction of Landlord and Landlord's mortgagee(s).  Tenant will, upon the request of Landlord at any time during which Landlord has reason to believe that Tenant is not in compliance with this Section 5.2 (and in any event no earlier than sixty (60) days and no later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of this Lease), cause to be performed an environmental audit of the Premises at Tenant's expense by an established environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to Landlord.  In the event the audit provides that Corrective Action is required then Tenant shall immediately perform the same at its sole cost and expense. 
  5.2.7      Tenant's Environmental Indemnity  .  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tenant agrees to promptly indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Landlord and Landlord's members, partners, subpartners, independent contractors, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, "  Landlord Parties  ") from and against any and all claims, damages, judgments, suits, causes of action, losses, liabilities, penalties, fines, expenses and costs (including, without limitation, clean-up, removal, remediation and restoration costs, sums paid in settlement of claims, attorneys' fees, consultant fees and expert fees and court costs) which arise or result from the presence of Hazardous Materials on, in, under or about the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Project and which are caused or permitted by Tenant or any of Tenant's Parties during the Term of this Lease to the extent arising from or caused, directly or indirectly, by (i) the presence in, on, under or about the Premises and the Affected Areas, of any Hazardous Materials introduced by Tenant or any Tenant Parties; (ii) Tenant's or any Tenant Party's actual, proposed or threatened use, treatment, storage, transportation, holding, existence, disposition, manufacturing, control, management, abatement, removal, handling, transfer, generation or Release (past, present or threatened) of Hazardous Materials to, in, on, under, about or from the Premises or Affected Areas; (iii) any past, present or threatened non-compliance or violations of any Environmental Laws in connection with Tenant and/or the Premises and/or the Affected Areas; (iv) personal injury claims; (v) the payment of any environmental liens, or the disposition, recording, or filing or threatened disposition, recording or filing of any environmental lien encumbering or otherwise affecting the Premises and/or the Affected Areas; (vi) diminution in the value of the Premises and/or the Project; (vii) damages for the loss or restriction of use of the Premises and/or the Project, including prospective rent, lost profits and business opportunities; (viii) sums paid in settlement of claims; (ix) reasonable attorneys' fees, consulting fees and expert fees; (x) the cost of any investigation of site conditions; and (xi) the cost of any repair, clean-up or remediation ordered by any governmental or quasi-governmental agency or body or otherwise deemed necessary in Landlord's reasonable judgment.  Tenant's obligations hereunder shall include, without limitation, and whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, all costs of any required or necessary repair, cleanup or detoxification or decontamination of the Premises, the Building and/or the Project, or the preparation and implementation of any closure, remedial action or other required plans in connection therewith required by applicable Environmental Laws.  For purposes of the indemnity provisions in this Section 5.2, any acts or omissions of Tenant and/or Tenant's Parties or others acting for or on behalf of Tenant (whether or not they are negligent, intentional, willful or unlawful) shall be strictly attributable to Tenant.  The provisions of this Section 5.2.7 will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. 
  5.2.8      Intentionally Omitted  .   
  5.2.9      Landlord's Termination Option for Certain Environmental Problems  .  If Hazardous Materials are present at the Premises that are required by Environmental Law to be remediated and Tenant is not responsible therefor pursuant to Section 5.2, Landlord shall remediate such Hazardous Materials and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.   
  5.2.10      Control Areas  .  ''In addition to the Hazmat Storage Space described in Section 24.38 below, Tenant shall have two (2) dedicated control areas on the third (3   rd   ) floor of the Building and the right to use its pro rata share of the control area on the fourth (4   th   ) floor of the Building (collectively, the "  Control Areas  ").  Such Control Areas are more particularly described on   Exhibit I   attached hereto. 
  5.2.11      Landlord's Environmental Indemnity  .  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Landlord agrees to promptly indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Tenant and Tenant's Parties from and against any and all claims, damages, judgments, suits, causes of action, losses, liabilities, penalties, fines, expenses and costs (including,  

without limitation, clean-up, removal, remediation and restoration costs, sums paid in settlement of claims, attorneys' fees, consultant fees and expert fees and court costs) which arise or result from the presence of Hazardous Materials on, in, under or about the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Project caused by Landlord or any of Landlord's Parties during the Term of this Lease; provided, however, that Landlord's indemnity obligations shall not extend to loss of business, loss of profits or other consequential damages which may be suffered by Tenant.  If Hazardous Materials are present at the Premises that are required by Environmental Law to be remediated and Tenant is not responsible therefor pursuant to Section 5.2, Landlord shall remediate such Hazardous Materials. 
  5.3      Odors and Exhaust  .  Landlord and Tenant therefore agree as follows: 
  5.3.1    Tenant shall not cause or permit (or conduct any activities that would cause) any release of any odors or fumes of any kind from the Premises which are detectable to a typical person. 
  5.3.2    Landlord, as part of the Landlord's Work, will ensure that the Building has a ventilation system that is adequate, suitable, and appropriate to vent the Premises in a manner that does not release odors affecting any indoor or outdoor part of the Premises, and Tenant shall vent the Premises through such system.  The placement and configuration of all ventilation exhaust pipes, louvers and other equipment shall be subject to Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.   
  5.3.3    In connection with preparing the Construction Drawings for the Tenant Improvements, the parties shall work together to include odor eliminators and other devices (such as filters, air cleaners, scrubbers and whatever other equipment may reasonably be necessary or appropriate) to remove, eliminate and abate any odors, fumes or other substances in Tenant's exhaust stream that emanate from the Premises in amounts detectable to the typical person.   
  5.3.4    Tenant's responsibility to remove, eliminate and abate odors, fumes and exhaust from the Premises in amounts detectable to the typical person shall continue throughout the Term.

directly to the provider if possible.  If any such utility is not separately metered or submetered to Tenant, Tenant shall pay Tenant's Share of all charges of such utility jointly metered with other premises as Additional Rent or, in the alternative, Landlord may, at its option, monitor the usage of such utilities by Tenant and charge Tenant with the cost of purchasing, installing and monitoring such metering equipment, which cost shall be paid by Tenant as Additional Rent.  To the extent that Tenant uses more than Tenant's Share of any utilities, then Tenant shall pay Landlord Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses to reflect such excess. 
  6.4      Interruption of Use  .  Subject to Section 6.9 below, Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for damages, by abatement of Rent or otherwise, for failure to furnish or delay in furnishing any service (including, but not limited to, any central plant or other lab system, telephone and telecommunication services), or for any diminution in the quality or quantity thereof, when such failure or delay or diminution is occasioned, in whole or in part, by repairs, replacements, or improvements, by any strike, lockout or other labor trouble, by inability to secure electricity, gas, water, or other fuel at the Building or Project after reasonable effort to do so, by any accident or casualty whatsoever, by act or default of Tenant or other parties, or by any other cause beyond Landlord's reasonable control; and such failures or delays or diminution shall never be deemed to constitute an eviction or disturbance of Tenant's use and possession of the Premises or relieve Tenant from paying Rent or performing any of its obligations under this Lease.  Furthermore, Landlord shall not be liable under any circumstances for a loss of, or injury to, property (including scientific research and any intellectual property) or for injury to, or interference with, Tenant's business, including, without limitation, loss of profits, however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to a failure to furnish any of the services or utilities as set forth in this Article 6. 
  6.5      Additional Services  .  Landlord shall also have the exclusive right, but not the obligation, to provide any additional services which may be required by Tenant, including, without limitation, locksmithing and additional repairs and maintenance, provided that Tenant shall pay to Landlord within ten (10) business days after billing and as Additional Rent hereunder, the sum of all reasonable and actual costs incurred by Landlord in connection with providing such additional services, which shall not exceed the amount which would have been charged for such services by a competent unrelated third party in the South San Francisco, CA market. 
  6.6      Janitorial Service  .  Landlord shall not be obligated to provide any janitorial services to the Premises or replace any light bulbs, lamps, starters and ballasts for lighting fixtures within the Premises.  Tenant shall be solely responsible, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, for (i) retaining appropriate vendors to perform all janitorial services, trash removal and other cleaning of the Premises, and (ii) the replacement of all light bulbs, lamps, starters and ballasts for lighting fixtures within the Premises, all as appropriate to maintain the Premises in a first-class manner consistent with the first-class nature of the Building and Project.  Such services to be provided by Tenant shall be performed by contractors and pursuant to service contracts approved by Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and Landlord's failure to respond within ten (10) business days to a request for approval shall, if such failure continues for an additional two (2) business days after Tenant's second request, be deemed approval).  Tenant shall deposit trash as reasonably required in the area designated by Landlord from time to time.  All trash containers must be covered and stored in a manner to prevent the emanation of odors into the Premises or the Project.  Landlord shall have the right to inspect the Premises upon reasonable notice to Tenant (of not less than forty eight (48) hours) and to require Tenant to provide additional cleaning, if necessary.  In the event Tenant shall fail to provide any of the services described in this Section 6.6 to be performed by Tenant within ten (10) business days after notice from Landlord, which notice shall not be required in the event of an emergency, Landlord shall have the right to provide such services and any reasonable and actual costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection therewith shall be deemed Additional Rent due and payable by Tenant upon receipt by Tenant of a written statement of cost from Landlord. 
  6.7      Energy Statements  .  For any utilities serving the Premises for which Tenant is billed directly by such utility provider, Tenant agrees to furnish to Landlord (a) within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt thereof and after Landlord's request any invoices or statements for such utilities, (b) within thirty (30) days after Landlord's request, any other utility usage information reasonably requested by Landlord, and (c) within thirty (30) days after Landlord's request after each calendar year during the Term, an ENERGY STAR  Statement of Performance (or similar comprehensive utility usage report if requested by Landlord) and any other information reasonably requested by Landlord for the immediately preceding year.  Tenant shall retain records of utility usage at the Premises, including invoices and statements from the utility provider, for at least sixty (60) months, or such other period of time as may be required by  

applicable law if requested by Landlord.  Tenant acknowledges that any utility information for the Premises may be shared with third parties, including Landlord's consultants and governmental authorities.  In the event that Tenant fails to comply with this Section, Tenant hereby authorizes Landlord to collect utility usage information directly from the applicable utility providers.   
  6.8      Tenant's Security System  .  Tenant shall be entitled to install, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, a separate security system for the Premises as part of the Tenant Improvements; provided, however, that any such system shall be subject to Landlord's reasonable approval, and any such system must be compatible with the existing systems of the Project.  Tenant's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless as provided in, and subject to, Article 10 below shall also apply to Tenant's use and operation of any such system, and the installation of such system shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease.  At Landlord's option, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove such security system and repair any damage to the Premises resulting from such removal.  Tenant shall at all times provide Landlord with a contact person who can disarm the security system and who is familiar with the functions of the alarm system in the event of a malfunction, and Tenant shall provide Landlord with the alarm codes or other necessary information required to disarm the alarm system in the event Landlord must enter the Premises in the event of an emergency. 
  6.9      Abatement of Rent When Tenant Is Prevented From Using Premises  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, if Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or any portion thereof, for five (5) consecutive business days (the "  Eligibility Period  ") as a result of (i) any repair, maintenance or alteration performed or failed to be performed by Landlord after the Lease Commencement Date, including any Construction (as defined in Section 24.30 below), and required to be performed by Landlord under this Lease, or (ii) any failure to provide to the Premises any of the essential utilities and services required to be provided in Section 6.1 above, or (iii) any failure to provide access to the Premises including Tenant's access to the Parking Areas, then Tenant's obligation to pay Rent shall be abated or reduced, as the case may be, from and after the first (1st) day of the Eligibility Period and continuing until such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable square feet of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable square feet of the Premises.  To the extent Tenant shall be entitled to abatement of rent because of a damage or destruction pursuant to Section 18 or a taking pursuant to Section 19, then the Eligibility Period shall not be applicable.  Landlord will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize unreasonable interference with Tenant's Permitted Use in connection with Landlord's exercise of Landlord's rights under this Article 6, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Tenant not less than ten (10) business days prior written notice of any planned utility or other Building system interruption or systems testing which would require evacuation of the Premises or Building. 
   
  ARTICLE 7       REPAIRS 
  7.1      Tenant's Repairs  .  Subject to Landlord's repair obligations in the Tenant Work Letter, Sections 7.2 and 11.1 below, and otherwise as expressly set forth in this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant's own expense, keep the Premises, including all improvements, fixtures and furnishings therein, in good order, repair and condition at all times during the Lease Term, which repair obligations shall include, without limitation, the obligation to promptly and adequately repair all damage to the Premises and replace or repair all damaged or broken fixtures and appurtenances, together with all portions of the HVAC, electrical, mechanical plumbing, life safety and lab systems from the point that such systems solely serves the Premises and all portions of all fume hoods and other exhaust systems (all such systems collectively being referred to as the "  Premises Systems  "), in a first-class condition; provided, however, that if there is less than two (2) years remaining in the then current Term of this Lease and if there is a capital repair or replacement of a Premises System which costs in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) then Landlord shall effect such repair or placement and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the amortized cost of the same based on the useful life of such Premises System.  Tenant's obligations shall include restorations, replacements or renewals, including capital expenditures for restorations, replacements or renewals which will have an expected life beyond the Term, when necessary to keep the Premises and all improvements thereon or a part thereof and the Premises Systems in first-class order, condition and repair and in compliance with all applicable laws.  Except as expressly set forth in  

this Lease, it is intended by the parties hereto that Landlord shall have no obligation, in any manner whatsoever, to repair or maintain the Premises, the improvements located therein or the equipment therein, or the Premises Systems whether structural or nonstructural, all of which obligations are intended to be the expense of Tenant (whether or not such repairs, maintenance or restoration shall have an expected life extending beyond the Term).  Tenant's maintenance of the Premises Systems shall comply with the manufacturers' recommended operating and maintenance procedures.  Tenant shall enter into and pay for maintenance contracts (in forms satisfactory to Landlord in its commercially reasonable discretion, which may require, without limitation, that any third party contractor provide Landlord with evidence of insurance as required by Landlord) for the Premises Systems in accordance with the manufacturers' recommended operating and maintenance procedures.  Such maintenance contracts shall be with reputable contractors, satisfactory to Landlord in its commercially reasonable discretion, who shall have not less than ten (10) years of experience in maintaining such systems in biotechnical facilities.  Upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall provide maintenance reports from any such contractors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Landlord's option, or if Tenant fails to commence to make such repairs within thirty (30) days of Landlord's demand, or fails to diligently prosecute such repairs to completion, Landlord may, but need not, make such repairs and replacements, and Tenant shall pay Landlord the cost thereof, including a percentage of the cost thereof (to be uniformly established for the Building) sufficient to reimburse Landlord for all overhead, general conditions, fees and other costs or expenses arising from Landlord's involvement with such repairs and replacements forthwith upon being billed for same.  In addition, Landlord reserves the right, upon notice to Tenant, to procure and maintain any or all of such service contracts, and if Landlord so elects, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, upon demand, for the costs thereof.  Within thirty (30) days of Landlord's request, Tenant shall provide to Landlord a copy of the budget for maintenance, repairs and replacements at the Premises for the preceding calendar year, as well as a detailed summary of the amounts actually expended by Tenant during such period for maintenance, repairs and replacements at the Premises. 
  7.2      Landlord's Repairs  .  Anything contained in Section 7.1 above to the contrary notwithstanding, and subject to the Tenant Work Letter, Articles 11 and 12 below, and other express provisions of this Lease, Landlord shall repair and maintain the structural portions of the Building, and the Building Systems serving the Building and not located in the Premises; provided, however, to the extent such maintenance and repairs are caused by the act, neglect, fault of or omission of any duty by Tenant, its agents, servants, employees or invitees, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, the reasonable cost of such maintenance and repairs.  There shall be no abatement of rent and no liability of Landlord by reason of any injury to or interference with Tenant's business arising from the making of any repairs, alterations or improvements in or to any portion of the Project, Building or the Premises or in or to fixtures, appurtenances and equipment therein, provided Landlord uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Tenant's use.  Tenant hereby waives and releases its right to make repairs at Landlord's expense under Sections 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code; or under any similar law, statute, or ordinance now or hereafter in effect. 
   
  ARTICLE 8       ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS 
  8.1      Landlord's Consent to Alterations  .  Except for Cosmetic Alterations (defined below), Tenant may not make any improvements, alterations, additions or changes to the Premises (collectively, the "  Alterations  ") without first procuring the prior written consent of Landlord to such Alterations, which consent shall be requested by Tenant not less than ten (10) business days prior to the commencement thereof, and which consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and Landlord's failure to respond within seven (7) business days to a request for approval shall, if such failure continues for an additional two (2) business days after Tenant' second request, be deemed approval); provided, however, Landlord may withhold its consent in its sole and absolute discretion with respect to any Alterations which may affect the structural components of the Building or the Systems and Equipment or which can be seen from outside the Premises ("  Prohibited Alterations  ").  Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Landlord's prior consent shall not be required with respect to any interior Alterations to the office portion of the Premises which (i) are cosmetic in nature and are not Prohibited Alterations, (ii) cost less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) for any one (1) job, and (iii) do not require a permit of any kind, as long as (A) Tenant delivers to Landlord notice and a copy of any final plans, specifications and working drawings for any such Alterations at least ten (10) days prior to commencement of the work thereof, and (B) the other conditions of this Article 8 are satisfied including, without limitation, conforming to Landlord's rules, regulations and insurance requirements which  

govern contractors.  Tenant shall pay for all overhead, general conditions, fees and other costs and expenses of the Alterations, and shall pay to Landlord a Landlord supervision fee of three percent (3%) of the cost of the Alterations.  The construction of the initial improvements to the Premises shall be governed by the terms of the Tenant Work Letter and not the terms of this Article 8. 
  8.2      Manner of Construction  .  Landlord may impose, as a condition of its consent to all Alterations or repairs of the Premises, such requirements as Landlord in its reasonable discretion may deem desirable, including, but not limited to, the requirement that Tenant utilize for such purposes only contractors, materials, mechanics and materialmen approved by Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (and Landlord's failure to respond within seven (7) business days to a request for approval shall, if such failure continues for an additional two (2) business days after Tenant' second request, be deemed approval); provided, however, Landlord may impose such requirements as Landlord may determine, in its commercially reasonable discretion, with respect to any work affecting the structural components of the Building or Systems and Equipment (including designating specific contractors to perform such work, so long as Landlord provides at least two (2) specific contractors to allow Tenant to competitively bid the work).  Tenant shall construct such Alterations and perform such repairs in compliance with any and all applicable rules and regulations of any federal, state, county or municipal code or ordinance and pursuant to a valid building permit (if required by the nature of the work), issued by the city in which the Building is located, and in conformance with Landlord's reasonable construction rules and regulations.  Landlord's approval of the plans, specifications and working drawings for Tenant's Alterations shall create no responsibility or liability on the part of Landlord for their completeness, design sufficiency, or compliance with all laws, rules and regulations of governmental agencies or authorities.  All work with respect to any Alterations must be done in a good and workmanlike manner and diligently prosecuted to completion.  Tenant shall cause all Alterations to be performed in such manner as not to obstruct access by any person to the Building or Project or the common areas, and as not to obstruct the business of Landlord or other tenants of the Project, or interfere with the labor force working at the Project.  If Tenant makes any Alterations, Tenant agrees to carry "Builder's All Risk" insurance in an amount approved by Landlord covering the construction of such Alterations, and such other insurance as Landlord may require, it being understood and agreed that all of such Alterations shall be insured by Tenant pursuant to Article 10 below immediately upon completion thereof.  Landlord may, in its discretion, require Tenant to obtain a lien and completion bond or some alternate form of security satisfactory to Landlord in an amount sufficient to ensure the lien-free completion of such Alterations (the estimated cost of which exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) and naming Landlord as a co-obligee.  Upon completion of any Alterations, Tenant shall (i) cause a Notice of Completion to be recorded in the office of the Recorder of the county in which the Project is located in accordance with Section 3093 of the Civil Code of the State of California or any successor statute, (ii) deliver to the management office of the Building a reproducible copy of the "as built" drawings of the Alterations, and (iii) deliver to Landlord evidence of payment, contractors' affidavits and full and final waivers of all liens for labor, services or materials. 
  8.3      Ownership of Alterations; No Removal of Tenant Improvements Required  .  All Alterations, improvements, fixtures and/or permanently built-in equipment which may be installed or placed in or about the Premises (including, but not limited to, all floor and wall coverings, cabinet work and paneling, sinks and related plumbing fixtures, laboratory benches, exterior venting fume hoods and walk-in freezers and refrigerators, ductwork, conduits, electrical panels and circuits), shall be at the sole cost of Tenant and shall remain the property of Tenant during the Term, and upon expiration of earlier termination of this Lease, shall be and become the property of Landlord.  Furthermore, Landlord may require that Tenant remove any Alterations, improvements, fixtures and/or equipment upon the expiration or early termination of the Lease Term, and repair any damage to the Premises and Building caused by such removal (provided that Landlord so designates at the time that Landlord consents to such Alteration but Landlord will only be required to so designate in the event Tenant requests, in Tenant's request for such consent, that Landlord make such determination).  If Tenant fails to complete such removal and/or to repair by the end of the Lease Term, Landlord may do so and may charge the cost thereof to Tenant.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant remove any improvement from the Premises as to which Landlord contributed payment, including the Tenant Improvements, without Landlord's prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion, and no removal of any portion of the Tenant Improvements constructed in accordance with the Work Letter shall be required to be removed. 

8.4      Wi-Fi Network  .  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Tenant desires to install wireless intranet, Internet and communications network ("  Wi-Fi Network  ") in the Premises for the use by Tenant and its employees, then the same shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.4 (in addition to the other provisions of this Article 8).  In the event Landlord consents to Tenant's installation of such Wi-Fi Network, Tenant shall, in accordance with Article 15 below, remove the Wi-Fi Network from the Premises prior to the termination of the Lease.  Tenant shall use the Wi-Fi Network so as not to cause any interference to other tenants in the Building or to other tenants at the Project or with any other tenant's communication equipment, and not to damage the Building or Project or interfere with the normal operation of the Building or Project, and Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses and liabilities (including attorneys' fees) arising out of Tenant's failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.4, except to the extent same is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord and which is not covered by the insurance carried by Tenant under this Lease (or which would not be covered by the insurance required to be carried by Tenant under this Lease).  Should any interference occur, Tenant shall take all necessary steps as soon as reasonably possible and no later than five (5) business days following such occurrence to correct such interference.  If such interference continues after such five (5) business day period, Tenant shall immediately cease operating such Wi-Fi Network until such interference is corrected or remedied to Landlord's satisfaction.  Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has granted and/or may grant telecommunication rights to other tenants and occupants of the Building and Project and to telecommunication service providers and in no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any interference of the same with such Wi-Fi Network.  Landlord makes no representation that the Wi-Fi Network will be able to receive or transmit communication signals without interference or disturbance.  Tenant shall (i) be solely responsible for any damage caused as a result of the Wi-Fi Network, (ii) promptly pay any tax, license or permit fees charged pursuant to any laws or regulations in connection with the installation, maintenance or use of the Wi-Fi Network and comply with all precautions and safeguards recommended by all governmental authorities, (iii) pay for all necessary repairs, replacements to or maintenance of the Wi-Fi Network, and (iv) be responsible for any modifications, additions or repairs to the Building or Project, including without limitation, Building or Project systems or infrastructure, which are required by reason of the installation, operation or removal of Tenant's Wi-Fi Network.  Should Landlord be required to retain professionals to research any interference issues that may arise and confirm Tenant's compliance with the terms of this Section 8.4, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the reasonable costs incurred by Landlord in connection with Landlord's retention of such professionals, the research of such interference issues and confirmation of Tenant's compliance with the terms of this Section 8.4 within thirty (30) days after the date Landlord submits to Tenant an invoice for such costs.  This reimbursement obligation is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies Landlord may have in the event of a breach or default by Tenant under this Lease 
   
  ARTICLE 9       COVENANT AGAINST LIENS 
  Tenant has no authority or power to cause or permit any lien or encumbrance of any kind whatsoever, whether created by act of Tenant, operation of law or otherwise, to attach to or be placed upon the Project, Building or Premises, and any and all liens and encumbrances created by Tenant shall attach to Tenant's interest only.  Landlord shall have the right at all times to post and keep posted on the Premises any notice which it deems necessary for protection from such liens.  Tenant shall not cause or permit any lien of mechanics or materialmen or others to be placed against the Project, the Building or the Premises with respect to work or services claimed to have been performed for or materials claimed to have been furnished to Tenant or the Premises, and, in case of any such lien attaching or notice of any lien, Tenant shall cause it to be immediately released and removed of record.  If any such lien is not released and removed within     ten     (  10  ) business days after notice of such lien is delivered by Landlord to Tenant, then Landlord may, at its option, take all action necessary to release and remove such lien, without any duty to investigate the validity thereof, and all sums, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by Landlord in connection with such lien shall be deemed Additional Rent under this Lease and shall be due and payable by Tenant   ten (10) business days of demand  .  In the event that Tenant leases or finances the acquisition of equipment, furnishings or other personal property of a removable nature utilized by Tenant in the operation of Tenant's business, Tenant warrants that any Uniform Commercial Code financing statement shall, upon its face or by exhibit thereto, indicate that such financing statement is applicable only to removable personal property of Tenant located within the Premises.  In no event shall the address of the Premises be furnished on a financing statement without qualifying language as to applicability of  

the lien only to removable personal property located in an identified suite leased by Tenant.  Should any holder of a financing statement record or place of record a financing statement that appears to constitute a lien against any interest of Landlord or against equipment that may be located other than within an identified suite leased by Tenant, Tenant shall, within ten (10)     business     days after filing such financing statement, cause (a) a copy of the Lender security agreement or other documents to which the financing statement pertains to be furnished to Landlord to facilitate Landlord's ability to demonstrate that the lien of such financing statement is not applicable to Landlord's interest and (b) Tenant's lender to amend such financing statement and any other documents of record to clarify that any liens imposed thereby are not applicable to any interest of Landlord in the Premises. 
   
  ARTICLE 10       INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE 
  10.1      Indemnification and Waiver  .  Tenant hereby assumes all risk of damage to property and injury to persons, in, on, or about the Premises (unless caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or any Landlord Party or Landlord's breach of this Lease), and agrees that Landlord and the Landlord Parties shall not be liable for, and are hereby released from any responsibility for, any damage to property or injury to persons or resulting from the loss of use thereof, which damage or injury is sustained by Tenant or by other persons claiming through Tenant.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless the Landlord Parties from any and all loss, cost, damage, expense and liability (including without limitation court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with or arising from any cause in, on or about the Premises (including, without limitation, Tenant's installation, placement and removal of Alterations, improvements, fixtures and/or equipment in, on or about the Premises), and any acts, omissions or negligence of Tenant or of any person claiming by, through or under Tenant, or of the contractors, agents, servants, employees, licensees or invitees of Tenant or any such person, in, on or about the Premises, the Building and Project; provided, however, that the terms of the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or any Landlord Party.  The provisions of this Section 10.1 shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.  Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant assumes all risk of, damage to personal property or scientific research or intellectual property, including loss of records kept by Tenant within the Premises and damage or losses caused by fire, electrical malfunction, gas explosion or water damage of any type (including broken water lines, malfunctioning fire sprinkler systems, malfunctioning lab systems including any malfunction of the central plant systems, roof leaks or stoppages of lines).  Tenant further waives any claim for injury to Tenant's business or loss of income relating to any such damage or destruction of personal property as described above. 
  10.2      Tenant's Compliance with Landlord's Fire and Casualty Insurance  .  Tenant shall, at Tenant's expense, comply as to the Premises with all insurance company requirements pertaining to the use of the Premises.  If Tenant's conduct or use of the Premises causes any increase in the premium for such insurance policies, then Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any such increase. Tenant, at Tenant's expense, shall comply with all rules, orders, regulations or requirements of the American Insurance Association (formerly the National Board of Fire Underwriters) and with any similar body. 
  10.3      Tenant's Insurance  .  Tenant shall maintain the following coverages in the following amounts: 
  10.3.1    Commercial General Liability Insurance covering the insured against claims of bodily injury, personal injury and property damage arising out of Tenant's operations, assumed liabilities or use of the Premises, including a Broad Form Commercial General Liability endorsement covering the insuring provisions of this Lease and the performance by Tenant of the indemnity agreements set forth in Section 10.1 above, (and with owned and non-owned automobile liability coverage, and liquor liability coverage if alcoholic beverages are served on the Premises) for limits of liability not less than: 

10.3.2    Physical Damage Insurance covering (i) all furniture, trade fixtures, equipment, merchandise and all other items of Tenant's property on the Premises installed by, for, or at the expense of Tenant, (ii) the Tenant Improvements, including any Tenant Improvements which Landlord permits to be installed above the ceiling of the Premises or below the floor of the Premises, and (iii) all other improvements, alterations and additions to the Premises, including any improvements, alterations or additions installed at Tenant's request above the ceiling of the Premises or below the floor of the Premises.  Such insurance shall be written on a "physical loss or damage" basis under a "special form" policy, for the full replacement cost value new without deduction for depreciation of the covered items and in amounts that meet any co-insurance clauses of the policies of insurance and shall include a vandalism and malicious mischief endorsement, sprinkler leakage coverage and earthquake sprinkler leakage coverage. 
  10.3.3    Workers' compensation insurance as required by law. 
  10.3.4    Loss-of-income, business interruption and extra-expense insurance in such amounts as will reimburse Tenant for direct and indirect loss of earnings attributable to all perils commonly insured against by prudent tenants or attributable to prevention of loss of access to the Premises or to the Building as a result of such perils. 
  10.3.5    Tenant shall carry comprehensive automobile liability insurance having a combined single limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) per occurrence and insuring Tenant against liability for claims arising out of ownership, maintenance or use of any owned, hired or non-owned automobiles. 
  10.3.6    Environmental Liability insurance (in form and substance satisfactory to Landlord) with limits of coverage not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) combined per occurrence and in the aggregate insuring against any and all liability with respect to the Premises and all areas appurtenant thereto arising out of any death or injury to any person, damage or destruction of any property, other loss, cost or expense resulting from any release, spill, leak or other contamination of the Premises, or any other property surrounding the Premises attributable to the presence of Hazardous Materials.  Upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall also obtain (at Tenant's sole cost and expense) environmental impairment liability insurance and environmental remediation liability insurance (in form and substance (including limits) acceptable to Landlord).  If, at any time it reasonably appears to Landlord that Tenant is not maintaining sufficient insurance or other means of financial capacity to enable Tenant to fulfill its obligations to Landlord hereunder, whether or not then accrued, liquidated, conditional or contingent, Tenant shall procure and thereafter maintain in full force and effect such insurance or other form of financial assurance, with or from companies or persons and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Landlord, as Landlord may from time to time reasonably request.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all such environmental liability insurance shall specifically insure the performance by Tenant of the indemnity provisions set forth in this Lease. 
  10.3.7      Form of Policies  .  The minimum limits of policies of insurance required of Tenant under this Lease shall in no event limit the liability of Tenant under this Lease.  Such insurance shall:  (i) name Landlord, and any other party it so specifies, as an additional insured; (ii) specifically cover the liability assumed by Tenant under this Lease, including, but not limited to, Tenant's obligations under Section 10.1 above; (iii) be issued by an insurance company having a rating of not less than A-X in Best's Insurance Guide or which is otherwise acceptable to Landlord and licensed to do business in the state in which the Project is located; (iv) be primary insurance as to all claims thereunder and provide that any insurance carried by Landlord is excess and is non-contributing with any insurance requirement of Tenant; (v) provide that said insurance shall not be canceled or coverage changed unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice shall have been given to Landlord and any mortgagee or ground or underlying lessor of Landlord; (vi) contain a cross-liability endorsement or severability of interest clause acceptable to Landlord; and (vii) with respect to the insurance required in Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.2 and 10.3.4 above, have deductible amounts not  

exceeding Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).  Tenant shall deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Landlord on or before the Lease Commencement Date and at least thirty (30) days before the expiration dates thereof.  If Tenant shall fail to procure such insurance, or to deliver such policies or certificate, within such time periods, Landlord may, at its option, in addition to all of its other rights and remedies under this Lease, and without regard to any notice and cure periods set forth in Section 19.1, procure such policies for the account of Tenant, and the cost thereof shall be paid to Landlord as Additional Rent within ten (10) days after delivery of bills therefor. 
  10.4      Subrogation  .  Landlord and Tenant agree to have their respective insurance companies issuing property damage, workers' compensation, public/general liability, insurance waive any rights of subrogation that such companies may have against Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be.  Landlord and Tenant hereby waive any right that either may have against the other on account of any loss or damage to their respective property to the extent such loss or damage is insurable under policies of insurance for fire and all risk coverage, theft, workers' compensation, public/general liability, or other similar insurance.  
  10.5      Landlord's Insurance  .  During the Lease Term, Landlord, as part of Operating Expenses, shall maintain property insurance covering the Project (excluding the property which Tenant is obligated to insure pursuant to the terms hereof) in the amount of full replacement cost thereof.  Such policy shall provide protection against "all risk of physical loss".  Such insurance shall be in such amounts and with such deductibles as Landlord reasonably deems appropriate but substantially consistent with the insurance maintained by other institutional owners of projects comparable to the Project in the general vicinity of the Project.  Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, obtain and carry any other form or forms of insurance as Landlord or Landlord's mortgagees or deed of trust beneficiaries may determine prudent.  Notwithstanding any contribution by Tenant to the cost of insurance as provided in this Lease, Tenant acknowledges that it has no right to receive any proceeds from any insurance policies maintained by Landlord and will not be named as an additional insured thereunder  
   
  ARTICLE 11       DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION 
  11.1      Repair of Damage to Premises by Landlord  .  Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of any damage to the Premises resulting from fire or any other casualty.  If the Premises or any common areas of the Building or Project serving or providing access to the Premises shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, within sixty (60) days of the damage Landlord shall notify Tenant of the estimated date of completion of the repair ("  Estimated Repair Completion Date  ").  Landlord shall promptly and diligently, subject to reasonable delays for insurance adjustment or other matters beyond Landlord's reasonable control, and subject to all other terms of this Article 11, restore the base, shell, and core of the Premises and such common areas.  Such restoration shall be to substantially the same condition of the base, shell, and core of the Premises and common areas prior to the casualty, except for modifications required by zoning and building codes and other laws or by the holder of a mortgage on the Project and/or the Building, or the lessor of a ground or underlying lease with respect to the Building, or any other modifications to the common areas deemed desirable by Landlord, provided access to the Premises and any common restrooms serving the Premises shall not be materially impaired.  Upon the occurrence of any damage to the Premises, Tenant shall assign to Landlord (or to any party designated by Landlord) all insurance proceeds payable to Tenant under Tenant's insurance required under Section 10.3 of this Lease, and Landlord shall repair any damage to the tenant improvements and alterations installed in the Premises and shall return such tenant improvements and alterations to their original condition; provided that if the costs of such repair of such tenant improvements and Alterations by Landlord exceeds the amount of insurance proceeds received by Landlord therefor from Tenant's insurance carrier, as assigned by Tenant, the excess costs of such repairs shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord prior to Landlord's repair of the damage, unless Tenant elects to terminate this Lease in accordance with the provisions of this Article.  In connection with such repairs and replacements of any such tenant improvements and Alterations, Tenant shall, prior to Landlord's commencement of such improvement work, submit to Landlord, for Landlord's review and approval, all plans, specifications and working drawings relating thereto, and Landlord shall select the contractors to perform such improvement work.  Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or its visitors, or injury to Tenant's business resulting in any way from such damage or the repair thereof; provided however, that if such fire or other casualty shall have damaged the Premises or common areas necessary to Tenant's occupancy, and if such damage is not the result of the negligence or willful  

misconduct of Tenant or Tenant's employees, contractors, licensees, or invitees, Landlord shall allow Tenant a proportionate abatement of Base Rent and Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs to the extent Landlord is reimbursed from the proceeds of rental interruption insurance purchased by Landlord as part of Operating Expenses, during the time and to the extent the Premises are unfit for occupancy for the purposes permitted under this Lease, and not occupied by Tenant as a result thereof.. 
  11.2      Landlord's Option to Repair  .  Notwithstanding Section 11.1 above to the contrary, Landlord may elect not to rebuild and/or restore the Premises, the Building and/or any other portion of the Project and instead terminate this Lease by notifying Tenant in writing of such termination within sixty (60) days after the date Landlord becomes aware of such damage, such notice to include a termination date giving Tenant ninety (90) days to vacate the Premises, but Landlord may so elect only if the Building shall be damaged by fire or other casualty or cause, whether or not the Premises are affected, and one or more of the following conditions is present:  (i) repairs cannot reasonably be substantially completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such damage (when such repairs are made without the payment of overtime or other premiums); (ii) the holder of any mortgage on the Project and/or the Building or ground or underlying lessor with respect to the Project and/or the Building shall require that the insurance proceeds or any portion thereof be used to retire the mortgage debt, or shall terminate the ground or underlying lease, as the case may be; or (iii) the damage is not fully covered, except for deductible amounts, by Landlord's insurance policies.  In addition, if the Premises or the Building is destroyed or damaged to any substantial extent during the last year of the Lease Term, then notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 11, Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Tenant of the exercise of such option within thirty (30) days after such damage, in which event this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date of such notice.  Upon any such termination of this Lease pursuant to this Section 11.2, Tenant shall pay the Base Rent and Additional Rent, properly apportioned up to such date of termination, and both parties hereto shall thereafter be discharged of all further obligations under this Lease, except for those obligations which expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. 
  11.3      Waiver of Statutory Provisions  .  The provisions of this Lease, including this Article 11, constitute an express agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction of, all or any part of the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Project, and any statute or regulation of the state in which the Project is located, including, without limitation, Sections 1932(2) and 1933(4) of the California Civil Code, with respect to any rights or obligations concerning damage or destruction in the absence of an express agreement between the parties, and any other statute or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, shall have no application to this Lease or any damage or destruction to all or any part of the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Project. 
  11.4      Tenant's Termination Rights Following Damage  .  Tenant, at any time after the damage until such rebuilding is completed, may terminate this Lease by delivering written notice to Landlord of such termination, in which event this Lease shall terminate as of the date of the giving of such notice, in any of the following circumstances: (i) Landlord fails to restore the Premises (including reasonable means of access thereto) within a period which is sixty (60) days longer than the Estimated Repair Completion Date stated in Landlord's notice to Tenant as the estimated rebuilding period (which sixty (60) day period shall be deemed extended due to Force Majeure delays and/or delays caused by Tenant); (ii) the Estimated Completion Repair Date is more than two hundred ten (210) days following the damage; or (iii) material  damage  occurs within the last year of the Term to the extent that in Tenant's judgment it cannot effectively operate its business in the Premises. 
   
  ARTICLE 12       CONDEMNATION 
  12.1      Permanent Taking  .  If the whole or any part of the Premises, Building or Project shall be taken by power of eminent domain or condemned by any competent authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, or if any adjacent property or street shall be so taken or condemned, or reconfigured or vacated by such authority in such manner as to require the use, reconstruction or remodeling of any part of the Premises, Building or Project, or if Landlord shall grant a deed or other instrument in lieu of such taking by eminent domain or condemnation, Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon ninety (90) days' notice, provided such notice is given no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such taking, condemnation, deed or other instrument.  If more than twenty-five  

percent (25%) of the rentable square feet of the Premises is taken, or if access to the Premises is substantially impaired, Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon ninety (90) days' notice, provided such notice is given no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such taking.  Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award or payment in connection therewith, except that Tenant shall have the right to file any separate claim available to Tenant for any taking of Tenant's personal property and fixtures belonging to Tenant and removable by Tenant upon expiration of the Lease Term pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and for moving expenses, so long as such claim does not diminish the award available to Landlord, or its ground lessor or mortgagee with respect to the Project, and such claim is payable separately to Tenant.  All Rent shall be apportioned as of the date of such termination, or the date of such taking, whichever shall first occur.  If any part of the Premises shall be taken, and this Lease shall not be so terminated, the Base Rent and Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs shall be proportionately abated.  Tenant hereby waives any and all rights it might otherwise have pursuant to Section 1265.130 of The California Code of Civil Procedure. 
  12.2      Temporary Taking  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 12, in the event of a temporary taking of all or any portion of the Premises for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or less, then this Lease shall not terminate but the Base Rent and Tenant's Share of Operating Expenses, Tax Expenses and Utilities Costs shall be abated for the period of such taking in proportion to the ratio that the amount of rentable square feet of the Premises taken bears to the total rentable square feet of the Premises.  Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award made in connection with any such temporary taking. 
   
  ARTICLE 13       COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT 
  Landlord covenants that Tenant, on paying the Rent, charges for services and other payments herein reserved and on keeping, observing and performing all the other terms, covenants, conditions, and agreements herein contained on the part of Tenant to be kept, observed and performed, shall, during the Lease Term, peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises subject to the terms, covenants, conditions, and agreements hereof without interference by any persons lawfully claiming by or through Landlord.  The foregoing covenant is in lieu of any other covenant express or implied. 
   
  ARTICLE 14       ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING 
  14.1      Transfers  .  Except as provided below, Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of Landlord, assign, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or permit any lien to attach to, or otherwise transfer, this Lease or any interest hereunder, permit any assignment or other such foregoing transfer of this Lease or any interest hereunder by operation of law, sublet the Premises or any part thereof, or permit the use of the Premises by any persons other than Tenant and its employees (all of the foregoing are hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as "  Transfers  " and any person to whom any Transfer is made or sought to be made is hereinafter sometimes referred to as a "  Transferee  ").  If Tenant shall desire Landlord's consent to any Transfer, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing, which notice (the "  Transfer Notice  ") shall include (i) the proposed effective date of the Transfer, which shall not be less than twenty (20) days nor more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of delivery of the Transfer Notice, (ii) a description of the portion of the Premises to be transferred (the "  Subject Space  "), (iii) all of the terms of the proposed Transfer, the name and address of the proposed Transferee, and a copy of all existing and/or proposed documentation pertaining to the proposed Transfer, (iv) current financial statements of the proposed Transferee certified by an officer, partner or owner thereof, (v) a list of Hazardous Materials, certified by the proposed Transferee to be true and correct, that the proposed Transferee intends to use or store in the Premises, and (vi) such other information as Landlord may reasonably require.  Any Transfer made without Landlord's prior written consent shall, at Landlord's option, be null, void and of no effect, and shall, at Landlord's option, constitute a default by Tenant under this Lease.  Whether or not Landlord shall grant consent, within thirty (30) days after written request by Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) to reimburse Landlord for its reasonable legal fees incurred by Landlord in connection with Tenant's proposed Transfer. 

14.2      Landlord's Consent  .  Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent (and Landlord's failure to respond within ten (10) business days to a request for consent shall, if such failure continues for an addition five (5) business days after Tenant's second request, be deemed consent) to any proposed Transfer on the terms specified in the Transfer Notice.  In no event shall Landlord be deemed to be unreasonable for declining to consent to a Transfer to a transferee jeopardizing directly or indirectly the status of Landlord or any of Landlord's affiliates as a Real Estate Investment Trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "  Revenue Code  ").  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, (w) no Transfer shall be consummated on any basis such that the rental or other amounts to be paid by the occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee thereunder would be based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived by the business activities of such occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee; (x) Tenant shall not furnish or render any services to an occupant, assignee, manager or other transferee with respect to whom transfer consideration is required to be paid, or manage or operate the Premises or any capital additions so transferred, with respect to which transfer consideration is being paid; (y) Tenant shall not consummate a Transfer with any person in which Landlord owns an interest, directly or indirectly (by applying constructive ownership rules set forth in Section 856(d)(5) of the Revenue Code); and (z) Tenant shall not consummate a Transfer with any person or in any manner that could cause any portion of the amounts received by Landlord pursuant to this Lease or any sublease, license or other arrangement for the right to use, occupy or possess any portion of the Premises to fail to qualify as "rents from real property" within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Revenue Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto or which could cause any other income of Landlord to fail to qualify as income described in Section 856(c)(2) of the Revenue Code.  The parties hereby agree that it shall be reasonable under this Lease and under any applicable law for Landlord to withhold consent to any proposed Transfer where one or more of the following apply, without limitation as to other reasonable grounds for withholding consent:  
  14.2.1    The Transferee is of a character or reputation or engaged in a business which is not consistent with the quality of the Building or Project; 
  14.2.2    The Transferee intends to use the Subject Space for purposes which are not permitted under this Lease; 
  14.2.3    The Transferee is either a governmental agency or instrumentality thereof; 
  14.2.4    The Transfer will result in more than the number of occupants per floor permitted by applicable law within the Subject Space; 
  14.2.5    The Transferee is not a party of reasonable financial worth and/or financial stability in light of the responsibilities to be undertaken, on the date consent is requested; 
  14.2.6    The proposed Transfer would cause Landlord to be in violation of another lease in the Project or agreement to which Landlord is a party relating to the Project, or would give an occupant of the Project a right to cancel its lease; 
  14.2.7    Either the proposed Transferee, or any person or entity which directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the proposed Transferee, (i) occupies space in the Project at the time of the request for consent, or (ii) is negotiating with Landlord to lease space in the Project at such time.   
  If Landlord consents to any Transfer pursuant to the terms of this Section 14.2 (and does not exercise any recapture rights Landlord may have under Section 14.4 below), Tenant may within six (6) months after Landlord's consent, enter into such Transfer of the Premises or portion thereof, upon substantially the same terms and conditions as are set forth in the Transfer Notice furnished by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to Section 14.1 above, provided that if there are any changes in the terms and conditions from those specified in the Transfer Notice (i) such that Landlord would initially have been entitled to refuse its consent to such Transfer under this Section 14.2, or (ii) which would cause the proposed Transfer to be more favorable to the Transferee than the terms set forth in Tenant's original Transfer Notice, Tenant shall again submit the Transfer to Landlord for its approval and other action under this Article 14 (including Landlord's right of recapture, if any, under Section 14.4 of this Lease). 

14.3      Transfer Premium  .  If, after the last day of the thirty-sixth (36th) month anniversary of the Lease Commencement Date, Landlord consents to a Transfer, as a condition thereto which the parties hereby agree is reasonable, Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Premium received by Tenant from such Transferee; no Tenant Transfer Premium shall be payable by Tenant for Transfers consented to by Landlord during the first thirty-six (36) months of the Lease Term in connection with the relevant assignment or sublease.  "  Transfer Premium  " shall mean all rent, additional rent or other consideration payable by such Transferee in excess of the Rent and Additional Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease on a per rentable square foot basis if less than all of the Premises is transferred, after deducting the reasonable expenses incurred by Tenant for (i) any changes, alterations and improvements to the Premises in connection with the Transfer (but only to the extent approved by Landlord), (ii) any brokerage commissions in connection with the Transfer, (iii) any rent concessions made or improvement allowances provided by Tenant, (iv) an amount equal to the Rent paid by Tenant during its marketing period, (v) marketing costs, and (vi) unamortized costs of the Tenant Improvements or Alterations paid for by Tenant  (collectively, the "  Subleasing Costs  ").  Transfer Premium shall also include, but not be limited to, any payment in excess of fair market value for services rendered by Tenant to Transferee or for assets, fixtures, inventory, equipment, or furniture transferred by Tenant to Transferee in connection with such Transfer. 
  14.4      Landlord's Option as to Subject Space  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 14, except as provided below, Landlord shall have the option, by giving written notice to Tenant within twenty (20) days after receipt of any Transfer Notice, to recapture the Subject Space.  Such recapture notice shall terminate this Lease with respect to the Subject Space as of the date stated in the Transfer Notice as the effective date of the proposed Transfer until the last day of the term of the Transfer as set forth in the Transfer Notice.  If this Lease is terminated with respect to less than the entire Premises, the Rent reserved herein shall be prorated on the basis of the rentable square feet retained by Tenant in proportion to the rentable square feet contained in the Premises, and this Lease as so amended shall continue thereafter in full force and effect, and upon request of either party, the parties shall execute written confirmation of the same.

In addition, Tenant agrees to remain responsible after the surrender of the Premises for the remediation of any recognized environmental conditions set forth in the Exit Survey (other than those caused by Landlord or caused by the migration of Hazardous Materials through no fault of Tenant, through air, water or soil, into the Premises) and compliance with any recommendations set forth in the Exit Survey relating to Hazardous Materials for which Tenant is responsible under the terms of this Lease.  Tenant shall, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, furnish to Landlord evidence that Tenant has closed all governmental permits and licenses, if any, issued in connection with Tenant's or Tenant's Parties' activities at the Premises.  If any such governmental permits or licenses have been issued and Tenant fails to provide evidence of such closure on or before the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, then until Tenant does so, the holdover provisions of Article 16 of this Lease shall apply.  Upon such expiration or termination, Tenant shall, without expense to Landlord, remove or cause to be removed from the Premises all telephone, data, and other cabling and wiring (including any cabling and wiring associated with the Wi-Fi Network, if any) installed or caused to be installed by Tenant (including any cabling and wiring, installed above the ceiling of the Premises or below the floor of the Premises), all debris and rubbish, and such items of furniture, equipment, free-standing cabinet work, and other articles of personal property owned by Tenant or installed or placed by Tenant at its expense in the Premises, and such similar articles of any other persons claiming under Tenant, as Landlord may, in its sole discretion, require to be removed, and Tenant shall repair at its own expense all damage to the Premises and Building resulting from such removal.  Tenant's obligations under this Section 15.2 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease 
   
  ARTICLE 16       HOLDING OVER 
  If Tenant holds over after the expiration of the Lease Term hereof, with or without the express or implied consent of Landlord, such tenancy shall be from month-to-month only, and shall not constitute a renewal hereof or an extension for any further term, and in such case Base Rent shall be payable at a monthly rate equal to     one     hundred     fifty     percent (  150  %) of the Base Rent applicable during the last rental period of the Lease Term under this Lease.  Such month-to-month tenancy shall be subject to every other term, covenant and agreement contained herein.  Landlord hereby expressly reserves the right to require Tenant to surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord as provided in this Lease upon the expiration or other termination of this Lease.  The provisions of this Article 16 shall not be deemed to limit or constitute a waiver of any other rights or remedies of Landlord provided herein or at law.  If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises     within five (5) days following     the termination or expiration of this Lease, in addition to any other liabilities to Landlord accruing therefrom, Tenant shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from all loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and liability resulting from such failure, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any claims made by any succeeding tenant founded upon such failure to surrender, and any lost profits to Landlord resulting therefrom  .

Tenant shall execute and deliver whatever other instruments may be reasonably required for such purposes.  Failure of Tenant to timely execute and deliver such estoppel certificate or other instruments shall constitute an acceptance of the Premises and an acknowledgment by  

Tenant that statements included in the estoppel certificate are true and correct, without exception.      Failure by Tenant to so deliver such estoppel certificate shall be a material default of the provisions of this Lease if such failure continues for an additional three (3) business days after Landlord's second request for such estoppel certificate.    In addition, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord, and shall indemnify Landlord from and against any loss, cost, damage or expense, incidental, consequential, or otherwise, including attorneys' fees, arising or accruing directly or indirectly, from any failure of Tenant to execute or deliver to Landlord any such estoppel certificate.      At any time that Tenant is not a public company,     u  pon request from time to time, Tenant agrees to provide to Landlord, within ten (10)     business     days after Landlord's delivery of written request therefor, current financial statements for Tenant, dated no earlier than one (1) year prior to such written request, certified as accurate by Tenant or, if available, audited financial statements prepared by an independent certified public accountant with copies of the auditor's statement.     
   
  ARTICLE 18       SUBORDINATION

Tenant covenants and agrees in the event any proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of any such mortgage, or if any ground lease is terminated, to attorn, without any deductions or set-offs whatsoever, to the purchaser upon any such foreclosure sale, or to the lessor of such ground lease, as the case may be, if so requested to do so by such purchaser or lessor, and to recognize such purchaser or lessor as the lessor under this Lease.  Tenant shall, within five (5) days of request by Landlord, execute such further instruments or assurances as Landlord may reasonably deem necessary to evidence or confirm the subordination or superiority of this Lease to any such mortgages, trust deeds, or ground leases  , conditioned upon Tenant's receipt of a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement  .  Tenant hereby irrevocably authorizes Landlord to execute and deliver in the name of Tenant any such instrument or instruments if Tenant fails to do so, provided that such authorization shall in no way relieve Tenant from the obligation of executing such instruments of subordination or superiority.  Tenant waives the provisions of any current or future statute, rule or law which may give or purport to give Tenant any right or election to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this Lease and the obligations of the Tenant hereunder in the event of any foreclosure proceeding or sale.  Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall execute the non-disturbance agreement ("  SNDA  ") in the form attached hereto as     Exhibit H  .  and Landlord shall provide Tenant with an original counterpart of such SNDA signed by Landlord's lender.

  19.1.3    Abandonment of the Premises by Tenant.  Abandonment is herein defined to include, but is not limited to, any absence by Tenant from the Premises for ten (10) business days or longer while an Event of Default by Tenant exists under any other provision of this Lease.

Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies, each and all of which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever. 
  19.2.1    Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim for damages therefor; and Landlord may recover from Tenant the following: 
  (i)    the worth at the time of award of any unpaid rent which has been earned at the time of such termination; plus 
  (ii)    the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus 
  (iii)    the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus

  (v)    at Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable law. 
  The term "rent" as used in this Section 19.2 shall be deemed to be and to mean all sums of every nature required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, whether to Landlord or to others.  As used in Sections 19.2.1(i) and (ii), above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at the Interest Rate set forth in Section 4.5 above.  As used in Section 19.2.1(iii) above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%).

Any such actions undertaken by Landlord pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 19.2.3 shall not be deemed a waiver of Landlord's rights and remedies as a result of Tenant's failure to perform and shall not release Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease. 
  19.3      Payment by Tenant  .  Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within ten (10) business days after delivery by Landlord to Tenant of statements therefor:  (i) sums equal to expenditures reasonably made and obligations incurred by Landlord in connection with Landlord's performance or cure of any of Tenant's obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 19.2.3 above; and (ii) sums equal to all expenditures reasonably made and obligations reasonably incurred by Landlord in collecting or attempting to collect the Rent or in enforcing or attempting to enforce any rights of Landlord under this Lease or pursuant to law, including, without limitation, all reasonable legal fees and other amounts so expended.

  19.5      Waiver of Default  .  No waiver by Landlord of any violation or breach by Tenant of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained shall be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any other or later violation or breach by Tenant of the same or any other of the terms, provisions, and covenants herein contained.  Forbearance by Landlord in enforcement of one or more of the remedies herein provided upon an Event of Default by Tenant shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such Event of Default.  The acceptance of any Rent  

hereunder by Landlord following the occurrence of any Event of Default, whether or not known to Landlord, shall not be deemed a waiver of any such Event of Default, except only an Event of Default in the payment of the Rent so accepted. 
  19.6      Efforts to Relet  .  For the purposes of this Article 19, Tenant's right to possession shall not be deemed to have been terminated by efforts of Landlord to relet the Premises, by its acts of maintenance or preservation with respect to the Premises, or by appointment of a receiver to protect Landlord's interests hereunder.  The foregoing enumeration is not exhaustive, but merely illustrative of acts which may be performed by Landlord without terminating Tenant's right to possession. 
  19.7      Bankruptcy  .

Tenant shall pay all expenses, points and/or fees incurred by Tenant in obtaining the L C.  The L C shall (i) be "callable" at sight, irrevocable and unconditional, (ii) be maintained in effect, whether through renewal or extension, for the period commencing on the date of this Lease and continuing until the date (the "  L C Expiration Date  ") that is no less than one hundred twenty (120) days after the expiration of the Lease Term as the same may be extended, and Tenant shall deliver a new L C or certificate of renewal or extension to Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the L C then held by Landlord, without any action whatsoever on the part of Landlord, (iii) be fully assignable by Landlord, its successors and assigns, (iv) permit partial draws and multiple presentations and drawings, and (v) be otherwise subject to the International Standby Practices-ISP 98, International Chamber of Commerce Publication #590.

S. Bankruptcy  

Code or any state bankruptcy code (collectively, "  Bankruptcy Code  "), or (C) an involuntary petition has been filed against Tenant under the Bankruptcy Code, or (D) the Lease has been rejected, or is deemed rejected, under Section 365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, following the filing of a voluntary petition by Tenant under the Bankruptcy Code, or the filing of an involuntary petition against Tenant under the Bankruptcy Code, or (E) the Bank has notified Landlord that the L C will not be renewed or extended through the L C Expiration Date, or (F) Tenant is placed into receivership or conservatorship, or becomes subject to similar proceedings under Federal or State law, or (G) Tenant executes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (H) if (1) any of the Bank's Fitch Ratings (or other comparable ratings to the extent the Fitch Ratings are no longer available) have been reduced below the Bank's Credit Rating Threshold, or (2) there is otherwise a material adverse change in the financial condition of the Bank, and Tenant has failed to provide Landlord with a replacement letter of credit, conforming in all respects to the requirements of this Article 20 (including, but not limited to, the requirements placed on the issuing Bank more particularly set forth in this Section 20.1 above), in the amount of the applicable L C Amount, within ten (10) business days following Landlord's written demand therefor (with no other notice or cure or grace period being applicable thereto, notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary) (each of the foregoing being an "  L C Draw Event  ").  The L C shall be honored by the Bank regardless of whether Tenant disputes Landlord's right to draw upon the L C.  In addition, in the event the Bank is placed into receivership or conservatorship by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any successor or similar entity, then, effective as of the date such receivership or conservatorship occurs, said L C shall be deemed to fail to meet the requirements of this Article 21, and, within ten (10) business days following Landlord's notice to Tenant of such receivership or conservatorship (the "  L C FDIC Replacement Notice  "), Tenant shall replace such L C with a substitute letter of credit from a different issuer (which issuer shall meet or exceed the Bank's Credit Rating Threshold and shall otherwise be acceptable to Landlord in its reasonable discretion) and that complies in all respects with the requirements of this Article 20.

Tenant shall be responsible for the payment of any and all costs incurred with the review of any replacement L C (including without limitation Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees), which replacement is required pursuant to this Section or is otherwise requested by Tenant.  In the event of an assignment by Tenant of its interest in the Lease (and irrespective of whether Landlord's consent is required for such assignment), Landlord shall accept a replacement or substitute letter of credit if it meets the standards of this Article 20. 
  20.2      Application of L C  .  Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Landlord is entering into this Lease in material reliance upon the ability of Landlord to draw upon the L C upon the occurrence of any L C Draw Event.  In the event of any L C Draw Event, Landlord may, but without obligation to do so, and without notice to Tenant (except in connection with an L C Draw Event under Section 20.1(H) above), draw upon the L C, in part or in whole, to cure any such L C Draw Event and/or to compensate Landlord for any and all damages of any kind or nature sustained or which Landlord reasonably estimates that it will sustain resulting from Tenant's breach or Event of Default of the Lease or other L C Draw Event and/or to compensate Landlord for any and all damages arising out of, or incurred in connection with, the termination of this Lease, including, without limitation, those specifically identified in Section 1951.2 of the California Civil Code.  The use, application or retention of the L C, or any portion thereof, by Landlord shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy provided by this Lease or by any applicable law, it being intended that Landlord shall not first be required to proceed against the L C, and such L C shall not operate as a limitation on any recovery to which Landlord may otherwise be entitled.  Tenant agrees not to interfere in any way with payment to Landlord of the proceeds of the L C, either prior to or following a "draw" by Landlord of any portion of the L C, regardless of whether any dispute exists between Tenant and Landlord as to Landlord's right to draw upon the L C.  No condition or term of this Lease shall be deemed to render the L C conditional to justify the issuer of the L C in failing to honor a drawing upon such L C in a timely manner.  Tenant agrees and acknowledges that (i) the L C constitutes a separate and independent contract between Landlord and the Bank, (ii) Tenant is not a third party beneficiary of such contract, (iii) Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the L C or the proceeds thereof, and (iv) in the event Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, Tenant is placed into receivership or conservatorship, and/or there is an event of a receivership, conservatorship or a bankruptcy filing by, or on behalf of, Tenant, neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenant's bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlord's claim and/or rights to the L C and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b)(6) of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code or otherwise. 

20.3      L C Amount; Maintenance of L C by Tenant; Liquidated Damages  .   
  20.3.1      L C Amount  .  The L C Amount shall be equal to the amount set forth in Section 10 of the Summary.  The L C Amount shall, at any and all times during the Lease Term (including any Option Term), be equal to Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00). 
  20.3.2      In General  .  If, as a result of any drawing by Landlord of all or any portion of the L C, the amount of the L C shall be less than the L C Amount, Tenant shall, within five (5) days thereafter, provide Landlord with additional letter(s) of credit in an amount equal to the deficiency, and any such additional letter(s) of credit shall comply with all of the provisions of this Article 20, and if Tenant fails to comply with the foregoing, the same shall be subject to the terms of Section 20.3.3 below.  Tenant further covenants and warrants that it will neither assign nor encumber the L C or any part thereof and that neither Landlord nor its successors or assigns will be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance, attempted assignment or attempted encumbrance.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the L C expires earlier than the L C Expiration Date, Landlord will accept a renewal thereof (such renewal letter of credit to be in effect and delivered to Landlord, as applicable, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the L C), which shall be irrevocable and automatically renewable as above provided through the L C Expiration Date upon the same terms as the expiring L C or such other terms as may be acceptable to Landlord in its reasonable discretion.  However, if the L C is not timely renewed, or if Tenant fails to maintain the L C in the amount and in accordance with the terms set forth in this Article 20, Landlord shall have the right to either (x) present the L C to the Bank in accordance with the terms of this Article 20, and the proceeds of the L C may be applied by Landlord against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that is not paid when due and/or to pay for all losses and damages that Landlord has suffered or that Landlord reasonably estimates that it will suffer as a result of any breach or default by Tenant under this Lease, or (y) pursue its remedy under Section 20.3.3 below.  In the event Landlord elects to exercise its rights under the foregoing item (x), (I) any unused proceeds shall constitute the property of Landlord (and not Tenant's property or, in the event of a receivership, conservatorship, or a bankruptcy filing by, or on behalf of, Tenant, property of such receivership, conservatorship or Tenant's bankruptcy estate) and need not be segregated from Landlord's other assets, and (II) Landlord agrees to pay to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the L C Expiration Date the amount of any proceeds of the L C received by Landlord and not applied against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that was not paid when due or used to pay for any losses and/or damages suffered by Landlord (or reasonably estimated by Landlord that it will suffer) as a result of any breach or default by Tenant under this Lease; provided, however, that if prior to the L C Expiration Date a voluntary petition is filed by Tenant, or an involuntary petition is filed against Tenant by any of Tenant's creditors, under the Bankruptcy Code, then Landlord shall not be obligated to make such payment in the amount of the unused L C proceeds until either all preference issues relating to payments under this Lease have been resolved in such bankruptcy or reorganization case or such bankruptcy or reorganization case has been dismissed. 
  20.3.3      Intentionally Omitted.     
  20.4      Transfer and Encumbrance  .  The L C shall also provide that Landlord may, at any time and without notice to Tenant and without first obtaining Tenant's consent thereto, transfer (one or more times) all or any portion of its interest in and to the L C to another party, person or entity, in connection with the assignment by Landlord of its rights and interests in and to this Lease.  In the event of a transfer of Landlord's interest in under this Lease (other than in connection with a financing) and the transferee's assumption of Landlord's obligations under this Lease, Landlord shall transfer the L C, in whole or in part, to the transferee and thereupon Landlord shall, without any further agreement between the parties, be released by Tenant from all liability therefor, and it is agreed that the provisions hereof shall apply to every transfer or assignment of the whole of said L C to a new landlord.  In connection with any such transfer of the L C by Landlord, Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, execute and submit to the Bank such applications, documents and instruments as may be necessary to effectuate such transfer and, Tenant shall be responsible for paying the Bank's transfer and processing fees in connection therewith; provided that, Landlord shall have the right (in its sole discretion), but not the obligation, to pay such fees on behalf of Tenant, in which case Tenant shall reimburse Landlord within ten (10) business days after Tenant's receipt of an invoice from Landlord therefor.  
  20.5      L C Not a Security Deposit  .  Landlord and Tenant (1) acknowledge and agree that in no event or circumstance shall the L C or any renewal thereof or substitute therefor or any proceeds thereof be deemed to be or treated as a "security deposit" under any law applicable to security deposits in the commercial context, including, but  

not limited to, Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code, as such Section now exists or as it may be hereafter amended or succeeded (the "  Security Deposit Laws  "), (2) acknowledge and agree that the L C (including any renewal thereof or substitute therefor or any proceeds thereof) is not intended to serve as a security deposit, and the Security Deposit Laws shall have no applicability or relevancy thereto, and (3) waive any and all rights, duties and obligations that any such party may now, or in the future will, have relating to or arising from the Security Deposit Laws.  Tenant hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code and any successor statute, and all other provisions of law, now or hereafter in effect, which (x) establish the time frame by which a landlord must refund a security deposit under a lease, and/or (y) provide that a landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy Event of Defaults in the payment of rent, to repair damage caused by a tenant or to clean the premises, it being agreed that Landlord may, in addition, claim those sums specified in this Article 20 and/or those sums reasonably necessary to (a) compensate Landlord for any loss or damage caused by Tenant's breach of this Lease, including any damages Landlord suffers following termination of this Lease, and/or (b) compensate Landlord for any and all damages arising out of, or incurred in connection with, the termination of this Lease, including, without limitation, those specifically identified in Section 1951.2 of the California Civil Code. 
  20.6      Non-Interference By Tenant  .  Tenant agrees not to interfere in any way with any payment to Landlord of the proceeds of the L C, either prior to or following a "draw" by Landlord of all or any portion of the L C, regardless of whether any dispute exists between Tenant and Landlord as to Landlord's right to draw down all or any portion of the L C.  No condition or term of this Lease shall be deemed to render the L C conditional and thereby afford the Bank a justification for failing to honor a drawing upon such L C in a timely manner.  Tenant shall not request or instruct the Bank of any L C to refrain from paying sight draft(s) drawn under such L C. 
  20.7      Waiver of Certain Relief  .  Tenant unconditionally and irrevocably waives (and as an independent covenant hereunder, covenants not to assert) any right to claim or obtain any of the following relief in connection with the L C: 
  20.7.1    A temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, permanent injunction, or other order that would prevent, restrain or restrict the presentment of sight drafts drawn under any L C or the Bank's honoring or payment of sight draft(s); or 
  20.7.2    Any attachment, garnishment, or levy in any manner upon either the proceeds of any L C or the obligations of the Bank (either before or after the presentment to the Bank of sight drafts drawn under such L C) based on any theory whatever. 
  20.8      Remedy for Improper Drafts  .  Tenant's sole remedy in connection with the improper presentment or payment of sight drafts drawn under any L C shall be the right to obtain from Landlord a refund of the amount of any sight draft(s) that were improperly presented or the proceeds of which were misapplied, together with interest at the Interest Rate and reasonable actual attorneys' fees and costs, provided that at the time of such refund, Tenant increases the amount of such L C to the amount (if any) then required under the applicable provisions of this Lease.  Tenant acknowledges that the presentment of sight drafts drawn under any L C, or the Bank's payment of sight drafts drawn under such L C, could not under any circumstances cause Tenant injury that could not be remedied by an award of money damages, and that the recovery of money damages would be an adequate remedy therefor.  In the event Tenant shall be entitled to a refund as aforesaid and Landlord shall fail to make such payment within ten (10) business days after demand, Tenant shall have the right to deduct the amount thereof together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the next installment(s) of Base Rent. 
  20.9      Security Deposit  .  In lieu of the L C, Tenant shall have the option to provide Landlord with a security deposit.  In such event, concurrent with Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord a security deposit (the "  Security Deposit  ") in the amount set forth in Section 10 of the Summary.  The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant during the Lease Term.  If Tenant commits an Event of Default, including, but not limited to, the provisions relating to the payment of Rent, Landlord may, but shall not be required to, use, apply or retain all or any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of any Rent or any other sum in default, or for the payment of any amount that Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of such Event of Default, or  

to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage that Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant's default.  If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used or applied, Tenant shall, within five (5) business days after written demand therefor, deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount, and Tenant's failure to do so shall be an Event of Default under this Lease.  If Tenant shall fully and faithfully perform every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, the Security Deposit, or any balance thereof, shall be returned to Tenant, or, at Landlord's option, to the last assignee of Tenant's interest hereunder, within sixty (60) days following the expiration of the Lease Term.  Tenant shall not be entitled to any interest on the Security Deposit.  Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code, and all other provisions of law, now or hereafter in force, which provide that Landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of rent, to repair damage caused by Tenant or to clean the Premises, it being agreed that Landlord may, in addition, claim those sums reasonably necessary to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage, foreseeable or unforeseeable, caused by the act or omission of Tenant or any officer, employee, agent or invitee of Tenant. 
   
  ARTICLE 21       COMPLIANCE WITH LAW

In addition, Tenant shall fully comply with all present or future programs intended to manage parking, transportation or traffic in and around the Project, and in connection therewith, Tenant shall take responsible action for the transportation planning and management of all employees located at the Premises by working directly with Landlord, any governmental transportation management organization or any other transportation-related committees or entities.  The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any judicial action, regardless of whether Landlord is a party thereto, that Tenant has violated any of said governmental measures, shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant  .

Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the ILabs system serving the Premises shall be part of the Tenant Improvements and that such system shall be owned by Landlord and shall remain a fixture in the Premises. 
  SECTION 2          TENANT IMPROVEMENTS 
  2.1      Tenant Improvement Allowance  .    Landlord     shall contribute to the cost of the Tenant Improvements     a one-time tenant improvement allowance (the "  Tenant Improvement Allowance  ") in the amount of up to, but not exceeding Five Million Six Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand One Hundred Sixty Dollars   ($  5,654,160.00 (i.e., One Hundred Twenty Dollars ($120.00) per rentable square foot of the Premises based on 47,118 rentable square feet in the Premises), to help pay for the costs of the design, permitting and construction of Tenant's improvements which are permanently affixed to the Premises     and depicted in the approved Final Working Drawings, as such term is defined below     (collectively, the "  Tenant Improvements  ").

  15.      Tenant will ensure that any vehicle parked in any of the parking spaces will be kept in proper repair and will not leak excessive amounts of oil or grease or any amount of gasoline.     
  16.      Tenant's right to use the Parking Facility will be in common with other tenants of the Building and with other parties permitted by Landlord to use the Parking Facility.  Landlord reserves the right to assign and reassign, from time to time, particular parking spaces for use by persons selected by Landlord, provided that Tenant's rights under the Lease are preserved.  Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for any unavailability of Tenant's designated spaces, if any, nor will any unavailability entitle Tenant to any refund, deduction, or allowance.  Tenant will not park in any numbered space or any space designated as:  RESERVED, HANDICAPPED, VISITORS ONLY, or LIMITED TIME PARKING (or similar designation). 
  17.    If the Parking Facility is damaged or destroyed, or if the use of the Parking Facility is limited or prohibited by any governmental authority, or the use or operation of the Parking Facility is limited or prevented by strikes or other labor difficulties or other causes beyond Landlord's reasonable control, Tenant's inability to use the parking spaces will not subject Landlord (and/or the Parking Operator, as the case may be) to any liability to Tenant  

and will not relieve Tenant of any of its obligations under the Lease and the Lease will remain in full force and effect.  Tenant will pay to Landlord upon demand, and Tenant indemnifies Landlord against, any and all loss or damage to the Parking Facility, or any equipment, fixtures, or signs used in connection with the Parking Facility and any adjoining buildings or structures caused by Tenant or any of its employees and agents. 
  18.    Tenant has no right to assign or sublicense any of its rights in the parking passes, except as part of a permitted assignment or sublease of the Lease; however, Tenant may allocate the parking passes among its employees. 
  Tenant shall be responsible for the observance of all of the Rules and Regulations and Parking Rules and Regulations in this   Exhibit D   by Tenant's employees, agents, clients, customers, invitees and guests.  Landlord may waive any one or more of the Rules and Regulations and/or Parking Rules and Regulations for the benefit of any particular tenant or tenants, but no such waiver by Landlord shall be construed as a waiver of such Rules and Regulations and/or Parking Rules and Regulations in favor of any other tenant or tenants, nor prevent Landlord from thereafter enforcing any such Rules or Regulations and/or Parking Rules and Regulations against any or all tenants of the Building and/or the Project.  Landlord reserves the right at any time to change or rescind any one or more of these Rules and Regulations and/or the Parking Rules and Regulations, or to make such other and further reasonable Rules and Regulations and/or Parking Rules and Regulations as in Landlord's judgment may from time to time be necessary for the management, safety, care and cleanliness of the Premises, Building and Project, and for the preservation of good order therein, as well as for the convenience of other occupants and tenants therein.  Tenant shall be deemed to have read these Rules and Regulations and Parking Rules and Regulations and to have agreed to abide by them as a condition of its occupancy of the Premises. 
  COMMON AREA AMENITIES 
  1.      Tenant understands that Landlord may provide certain common area amenities for Tenant's non-exclusive use.

  2.    Tenant understands and agrees that:  (i) Tenant uses the amenities at its own risk; and (ii) Landlord will not be liable for personal injury or death, or theft, loss of or damage to property.  Tenant indemnifies and agrees to hold Landlord and its agents and employees harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, and actions arising out of the use of the amenities by Tenant and its agents, employees and invitees, whether brought by any of such persons or any other person. 
  3.    All amenities offered shall remain at the locations designated by Landlord all times.  Tenant must use the equipment only in the manner intended.

  4.    Tenant shall be responsible for the cost or repairs or replacements of any amenities that are not returned to management after use or are damaged during the use of any such amenity by Tenant or Tenant's agents, employees or invitees and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any such cost within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefor. 
  5.      Tenant shall     cause its employees to     conduct themselves in a quiet and well-mannered fashion when on or about the amenities and not cause any disturbances or interfere with the use or enjoyment of the amenities by other tenants. 
  6.      Tenant shall not bring any food or beverages into any amenity area   without Landlord's prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld  .

  SUBORDINATION, NON-DISTURBANCE AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT 
  Loan No. 15617 
  Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association  c/o Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers  One Financial Plaza  Hartford, CT 06103  Attention:  Finance Group Loan Servicing 
  Re:  One Tower Place, South San Francisco, California 
  The undersigned, Achaogen, Inc., a Delaware corporation, ("  Tenant  ") understands that Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association ("  Lender  ") has made or will be making a loan (the "  Loan  ") to AP3-SF2 CT South LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("  Landlord  ") secured by a mortgage or deed of trust (the "  Mortgage  ") encumbering the real property (the "  Property  ") described on   Exhibit A  , attached hereto and made a part hereof.  Tenant and Landlord entered into an unrecorded lease agreement (the "  Lease  ") dated August __, 2016 by which Tenant leased from Landlord certain premises commonly known as One Tower Place, Suite 300, South San Francisco, California (the "  Leased Premises  "), and constituting a portion of the Property.  Tenant desires to be able to obtain the advantages of the Lease and occupancy thereunder in the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage and Lender wishes to have Tenant confirm the priority of the Mortgage over the Lease. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
           1. 
    Tenant hereby subordinates all of its right, title and interest under the Lease to the lien, operation and effect of the Mortgage and any other mortgages (as the same may be modified and/or extended from time to time) now or hereafter in force against the Property, and to any and all existing and future advances made under such Mortgage and any other mortgages. 
              2. 
    In the event that Lender becomes the owner of the Property by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise, Tenant agrees to unconditionally attorn to Lender and to recognize it as the owner of the Property and the Landlord under the Lease.  The Lender agrees not to terminate the Lease or disturb or interfere with Tenant's possession of the Leased Premises during the term of the Lease, or any extension or renewal thereof, so long as Tenant is not in default under the Lease beyond applicable notice, grace and cure periods, if any. 
              3. 
    Tenant agrees to commence paying all rents, revenues and other payments due under the Lease directly to Lender after Lender notifies Tenant that Lender is the owner and holder of the Loan and is invoking Lender's rights under the Loan documents to directly receive from Tenant all rents, revenues and other payments due  

under the Lease and Landlord hereby consents to such payment and agrees that all amounts so paid to Lender by Tenant shall be credited against Tenant's obligations under the Lease..  By making such payments to Lender, Tenant shall be deemed to have satisfied all such payment obligations to Landlord under the Lease. 
           4. 
    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Lender's affiliates, agents, co-lenders and participants, and each of their respective successors and assigns (each a "  Lender Party  " and collectively, the "  Lender Parties  "). 
     [Remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature pages follow] 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement to be duly executed as of the ____ day of __________, 2016.

EXHIBIT I 
  CONTROL AREAS 
  (SEE ATTACHED) 

RIDER 
  EXTENSION OPTION RIDER 
  This Extension Option Rider ("  Extension Rider  ") is attached to and made a part of the Lease by and between Landlord and Tenant.  The agreements set forth in this Extension Rider shall have the same force and effect as if set forth in the Lease.  To the extent the terms of this Extension Rider are inconsistent with the terms of the Lease, the terms of this Extension Rider shall control. 
  1.      Extension Option  .  Landlord hereby grants Tenant one (1) option (the "  Extension Option  ") to extend the Lease Term for a period of five (5) years (the "  Option Term  "), which option shall be exercisable only by written Exercise Notice (as defined below) delivered by Tenant to Landlord as provided below.  Upon the proper exercise of the Extension Option, the Lease Term shall be extended for the Option Term.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Landlord's option, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord under the Lease, at law or in equity, the Extension Option shall not be deemed properly exercised if as of the date of delivery of the Exercise Notice (as defined below) by Tenant, Tenant has previously been in default under the Lease beyond all applicable notice and cure periods.  The Extension Option is personal to the original Tenant and may only be exercised by the Original Tenant or any assignee of a Permitted Transfer (and not any assignee, sublessee or other transferee of Tenant's interest in the Lease) if the Original Tenant, or any assignee of a Permitted transfer, and any subtenant which is a Permitted Transferee occup(ies) the entire Premises as of the date of Tenant's delivery of the Exercise Notice. 
  2.      Option Rent  .  The annual Base Rent payable by Tenant during the Option Term (the "  Option Rent  ") shall be equal to the Fair Market Rental Rate for comparable office/laboratory space in the South San Francisco market.  As used herein, the "  Fair Market Rental Rate  " shall mean the annual base rent at which tenants, as of the commencement of the Option Term, will be leasing non-sublease space comparable in size, location (including views), functionality and quality to the Premises for a comparable term as the Option Term, which comparable space is located in the Building, the Other Future Building in the Project and in other comparable first-class biotechnology buildings in San Mateo County (the "  Market Area  "), taking into consideration all free rent and other out-of-pocket concessions generally being granted at such time for new (non-renewal) leases of such comparable space for the Option Term.  All other terms and conditions of the Lease shall apply throughout the Option Term; however, Tenant shall, in no event, have the option to extend the Lease Term beyond the Option Term described in Section 1 above. 
  3.      Exercise of Option  .  The Extension Option shall be exercised by Tenant, if at all, only in the following manner:  (i) Tenant shall deliver written notice ("  Interest Notice  ") to Landlord not more than fifteen (15) months nor less than fourteen (14) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term stating that Tenant   may   be interested in exercising the Extension Option; (ii) Landlord, after receipt of Tenant's notice, shall deliver notice (the "  Option Rent Notice  ") to Tenant not less than thirteen (13) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term setting forth the Option Rent; and (iii) if Tenant wishes to exercise the Extension Option, Tenant shall, on or before the date (the "  Exercise Date  ") which is (12) months prior to the expiration of the initial Lease Term, exercise the Extension Option by delivering written notice ("  Exercise Notice  ") thereof to Landlord.  Tenant's failure to deliver the Interest Notice or Exercise Notice on or before the applicable delivery dates therefore specified hereinabove shall be deemed to constitute Tenant's waiver of the Extension Option. 
  4.      Determination of Option Rent  .  If Tenant timely and appropriately objects in its Exercise Notice to Landlord to the Fair Market Rental Rate for the Option Term initially described in Landlord's Option Rent Notice, then Landlord and Tenant shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the Fair Market Rental Rate.  If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within thirty (30) days following Tenant's delivery of such Exercise Notice (the "  Outside Agreement Date  "), then each party shall submit to the other party a separate written determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate within fifteen (15) business days after the Outside Agreement Date, and such determinations shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4.1 through 4.7 below.  The failure of Tenant or Landlord to submit a written determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate within such fifteen (15) business day period shall conclusively be deemed to be such party's approval of the Fair Market Rental Rate submitted within such fifteen (15) business day period by the other party. 

4.1    Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one (1) arbitrator who shall by profession be an independent real estate broker who shall have no ongoing relationship with Tenant or Landlord and who shall have been active over the five (5) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of first class office buildings in the Market Area.  The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rental Rate is the closer to the actual Fair Market Rental Rate as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements with respect thereto set forth in Section 2 above.  Each such arbitrator shall be appointed within fifteen (15) days after the Outside Agreement Date. 
  4.2    The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall, within thirty (30) days of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator, attempt to reach a decision as to which of Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rental Rate is closer to the actual Fair Market Rental Rate.  If they are unable to agree within such time, then within the following fifteen (15) days, they shall agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two (2) arbitrators. 
  4.3    Within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator, reach a decision as to which of Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rental Rate is closer to the actual Fair Market Rental Rate and shall select such closer determination as the Fair Market Rental Rate and notify Landlord and Tenant thereof. 
  4.4    If the two initial arbitrators agree as to which of Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rental Rate is closer to the actual Fair Market Rental Rate, the joint decision of the two initial arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant, and if they are not able to agree, then the decision of the third arbitrator shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.. 
  4.5    If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an arbitrator within the time period specified in Section 4.1 hereinabove, the arbitrator  appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify Landlord and Tenant thereof, and such arbitrator's decision shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. 
  4.6    If the two (2) arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, within the time period provided in Section 4.2 above, then the parties shall mutually select the third arbitrator.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within the period described in Section 4.2 above, then either party may, upon at least five (5) days' prior written notice to the other party, request the Presiding Judge of the San Mateo County Superior Court, acting in his private and nonjudicial capacity, to appoint the third arbitrator.  Following the appointment of the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall within thirty (30) days thereafter reach a decision as to whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted Fair Market Rental Rate shall be used and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof.
