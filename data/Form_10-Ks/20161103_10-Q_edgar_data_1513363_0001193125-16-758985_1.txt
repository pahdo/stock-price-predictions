    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   
  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       
  Note 1. Organization and Nature of Business   
 Fidus Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation ( FIC,  and together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ), was formed
on February 14, 2011 for the purposes of (i) acquiring 100% of the limited partnership interests of Fidus Mezzanine Capital, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively,  Fund I ) and 100% of the membership interests of
Fund I s general partner, Fidus Mezzanine Capital GP, LLC ( FMCGP ), (ii) raising capital in an initial public offering that was completed in June 2011 (the  IPO ) and (iii) thereafter operating as an externally
managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ), that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC )
under the 1940 Act.    On June 20, 2011, FIC acquired 100% of the limited partnership interests in Fund I and 100% of the equity
interests in FMCGP, in exchange for 4,056,521 shares of common stock in FIC (the  Formation Transactions ). Fund I became FIC s wholly-owned subsidiary, retained its license to operate as a Small Business Investment Company
( SBIC ), and continues to hold investments and make new investments. The IPO consisted of the sale of 5,370,500 shares of the Company s common stock, including shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their exercise of the
over-allotment option, at a price of $15.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $73,626, after deducting underwriting fees and commissions and offering costs totaling $6,932.  
 The Company provides customized debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle-market companies. Fund I commenced operations on
May 1, 2007, and on October 22, 2007, was granted a license to operate as a SBIC under the authority of the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ). On March 29, 2013, the Company commenced operations of a second wholly-owned
subsidiary, Fidus Mezzanine Capital II, L.P. ( Fund II ) and on May 28, 2013, was granted a second license to operate Fund II as an SBIC. Collectively, Fund I and Fund II are referred to as the  Funds.  The SBIC licenses allow
the Funds to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures ( SBA debentures ), subject to the issuance of leverage commitments by the SBA and other customary procedures. As SBICs, the Funds are subject to a variety of regulations
and oversight by the SBA under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the  SBIC Act ), concerning, among other things, the size and nature of the companies in which they may invest and the structure of those investments.
   Fund I has also elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Fund II is not registered under the 1940 Act and relies on the
exclusion from the definition of investment company contained in Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes, the Company elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011.  
 For all periods subsequent to the consummation of the Formation Transactions and the IPO, the Company pays a quarterly base management fee and
an incentive fee to Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC (the  Investment Advisor ) under an investment advisory agreement (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ). The initial investment professionals of the Investment Advisor were
previously employed by Fidus Capital, LLC, who was the investment advisor to Fund I prior to consummation of the Formation Transactions.     Note 2.
Significant Accounting Policies      Basis of presentation:  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on  Form 10-Q,  Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies  ( ASC 946), and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and
reclassifications that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The current period s
results of operation are not necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year. Therefore, the unaudited financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes
thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Use of estimates:  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Consolidation:  Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and ASC 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investments in a
company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. As a result, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include only the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Funds. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

FIDUS INVESTMENT CORPORATION   
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   
  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       
   Fair value of financial instruments:  The Company measures and discloses fair value
with respect to substantially all of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 820    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC Topic 820 ). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to
measure fair value, and requires disclosures for fair value measurements, including the categorization of financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy based on the transparency of valuation inputs. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion regarding the fair value measurements and hierarchy.     Investment classification:  The Company
classifies its investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act,  Control Investments  are defined as investments in those companies where the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of such
company or has rights to maintain greater than 50% of the board representation. Under the 1940 Act,  Affiliate Investments  are defined as investments in those companies where the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities of
such company.  Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments  are those that neither qualify as Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.  
  Segments:  In accordance with ASC Topic 280    Segment Reporting , the Company has determined that it has a single reporting
segment and operating unit structure.     Cash and cash equivalents:  Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. The Company places its cash in financial institutions and, at times, such balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Company does
not believe its cash balances are exposed to any significant credit risk.     Deferred financing costs:  Deferred financing costs
consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 6) and SBA debentures. Deferred financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt agreement using the effective interest method.
Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as an offset to the corresponding debt liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.  
  Deferred equity financing costs:  Deferred equity financing costs include registration expenses related to shelf filings, including
expenses related to the launch of the ATM Program. These expenses primarily consist of Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) registration fees, legal fees and accounting fees incurred. These expenses are included in prepaid assets and
are charged to additional paid in capital upon the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering or charged to expense if no offering is completed.  
  Realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments:  Realized gains or losses on investments are
recorded upon the sale or disposition of a portfolio investment and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or disposition and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or
depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the consolidated statements of operations includes changes in the fair value of investments from the prior period, as determined in good faith by the
Company s board of directors (the  Board ) through the application of the Company s valuation policy, as well as reclassifications of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments to realized
gains or losses on investments.     Interest, fee and dividend income:  Interest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis
to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts. Interest and dividend income is accrued daily based on the outstanding principal amount and the contractual terms of the debt or preferred equity investment. Dividend income is recorded
at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Distributions from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is a distribution of earnings or a return of capital.  
 Certain of the Company s investments contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK ) income provision. The PIK income, computed at the
contractual rate specified in the applicable investment agreement, is added to the principal balance of the investment, rather than being paid in cash, and recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable, on the consolidated statements of
operations. Generally, PIK can be paid-in-kind or all in cash. The Company stops accruing PIK income when there is reasonable doubt that PIK income will be collected. PIK income is included in the Company s taxable income and, therefore,
affects the amount the Company is required to pay to shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain the Company s tax treatment as a RIC and to avoid corporate federal income tax, even though the Company has not yet collected the
cash.    When there is reasonable doubt that principal, interest or dividends will be collected, loans or preferred equity investments are
placed on non-accrual status and the Company will generally cease recognizing interest or dividend income. Interest and dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as interest or dividend income or may be applied to the
investment principal balance based on management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal, interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, payments are likely to remain
current.

  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       
  In connection with the Company s debt investments, the Company will sometimes receive
warrants or other equity-related securities from the borrower ( Warrants ). The Company determines the cost basis of Warrants based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt
and Warrants received. Any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its recorded fair value resulting from the assignment of value to the Warrants is treated as original issue discount ( OID ), and accreted into
interest income using the effective interest method over the term of the debt investment.    Transaction fees earned in connection with the
Company s investments are recognized as fee income. Such fees typically include fees for services, including structuring and advisory services, provided to portfolio companies. The Company recognizes income from fees for providing such
structuring and advisory services when the services are rendered or the transactions are completed. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as fee income when earned. Prior to the Formation Transactions,
and in accordance with the prior limited partnership agreement, the Company historically recorded transaction fees provided in connection with its investments as a direct offset to management fee expense.  
 The Company also typically receives loan origination or closing fees in connection with investments. Such loan origination and closing fees
are capitalized as unearned income and offset against investment cost basis on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and accreted into income over the life of the investment.  
  Partial loan sales:  The Company follows the guidance in ASC 860,  Transfers and Servicing,  when accounting for loan
participations and other partial loan sales. Such guidance requires a participation or other partial loan sale to meet the definition of a  participating interest,  as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed.
Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest should remain on the Company s consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and the proceeds recorded as a secured borrowing until the
definition is met. Management has determined that all participations and other partial loan sale transactions entered into by the Company have met the definition of a participating interest. Accordingly, the Company uses sale treatment in accounting
for such transactions.     Income taxes:  The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, which will
generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to stockholders. To maintain the tax treatment of a RIC, the Company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90.0% of
 investment company taxable income,  as defined by Subchapter M of the Code, each year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year
distributions into the next tax year; however, the Company will pay a 4.0% excise tax if it does not distribute at least 98.0% of the current year s ordinary taxable income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a
dividend declared prior to the later of the date on which the final tax return related to the year in which the Company generated such taxable income is filed or the 15 th  day of the 9 th  month following the close of such taxable year. In addition, the Company will be subject to federal excise tax if it does not distribute at least 98.2% of its net capital gains realized, computed
for any one year period ending October 31.    In the future, the Funds may be limited by provisions of the SBIC Act and SBA regulations
governing SBICs from making certain distributions to FIC that may be necessary to enable FIC to make the minimum distributions required to maintain the tax treatment of a RIC.  
 The Company has certain wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries (the  Taxable Subsidiaries ), each of which generally holds one or more of
the Company s portfolio investments listed on the consolidated schedules of investments. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, such that the Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the
Company s investment in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies that are taxed as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (such as entities organized as limited liability companies ( LLCs ) or other forms of pass through entities) while complying with the  source-of-income  requirements contained in the RIC tax
provisions. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes, and each Taxable Subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such income or
expense is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.    U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, and as a result,
distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized under GAAP. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences may arise as a result of, among other items, a
difference in the book and tax basis of certain assets and nondeductible federal income taxes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.  
 ASC Topic 740    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  ( ASC Topic 740 ) provides guidance for how uncertain tax
positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether
the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  to be respected by the applicable tax authorities. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet

the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
benefits in income tax provision, if any. There were no material uncertain income tax positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The 2013 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax
authorities.     Distributions to stockholders:  Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the record date with respect to such
distributions. The amount, if any, to be distributed to stockholders, is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, may be distributed at least annually,
although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.    The determination of the tax attributes for the
Company s distributions is made annually, and is based upon the Company s taxable income and distributions paid to its stockholders for the full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify for the preferential tax
rate on qualified dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign
corporations. The tax characterization of the Company s distributions generally includes both ordinary income and capital gains but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital.  
 The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan ( DRIP ) that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its
stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive dividends in cash. As a result, if the Company declares a cash dividend, the Company s stockholders who have not  opted out  of the DRIP at least three days prior to the
dividend payment date will have their cash dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of the Company s common stock. The Company has the option to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP through the issuance of new shares of
common stock or through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP plan administrator. Newly issued shares are valued based upon the final closing price of the Company s common stock on a date determined by the Board. Shares purchased in
the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP plan administrator before any associated brokerage or other costs. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements regarding dividend declarations and distributions.     Earnings and net asset value per share:  The earnings per share
calculations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are computed utilizing the weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Net asset value per share is calculated
using the number of shares outstanding as of the end of the period.     Stock repurchase plan:  The Company has an open market stock
repurchase program (the  Program ) under which the Company may acquire up to $5.0 million of its outstanding common stock. Under the Program, the Company may, but is not obligated to, repurchase outstanding common stock in the open market
from time to time provided that the Company complies with the prohibitions under its insider trading policies and the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market value and timing
constraints. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by Fidus  management, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, capital availability, applicable
legal and regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. Unless extended by the Board, the Company expected that the Program would have been in effect until January 22, 2017, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to
repurchase shares. On November 1, 2016, the Board extended the Program through December 31, 2017. The Program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and the Company cannot assure that any shares will be
repurchased under the Program. The Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. The Company did not make any repurchases of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  
  Recent accounting pronouncements:  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which amends the criteria for determining which entities are considered variable interest entities ( VIEs ), amends the criteria
for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the deferral granted to investment companies for application of the VIE consolidation model. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of
ASU 2015-02 had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,
 Interest   Imputation of interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 had no
material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements other than corresponding reductions to total assets and total liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Prior to adoption, the Company recorded
deferred financing costs as an asset on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-03, the

Company reclassified these deferred costs to a direct offset of the related debt liability on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The new guidance will be applied
retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company reclassified the $4,872 of deferred financing costs presented as an asset as of December 31, 2015 to a direct offset of the related debt liabilities as of such date on the consolidated
statements of assets and liabilities.    In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) . Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early application is permitted
only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial
position or disclosures.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will
have on the Company s consolidated financial position or disclosures.     Note 3. Portfolio Company Investments   
 The Company s portfolio investments principally consist of secured and unsecured debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in
privately held companies. The debt investments may or may not be secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company. The debt investments generally bear interest at fixed rates, and generally mature between five and
seven years from the original investment. In connection with a debt investment, the Company also may receive nominally priced equity warrants and/or make a direct equity investment in the portfolio company. The Company s warrants or equity
investments may be investments in a holding company related to the portfolio company. In addition, the Company periodically makes equity investments in its portfolio companies through Taxable Subsidiaries. In both situations, the investment is
generally reported under the name of the operating company on the consolidated schedules of investments.    As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had active investments in 49 portfolio companies and residual investments in five portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. The aggregate fair value of the total portfolio was $470,057 and the weighted average effective
yield on the Company s debt investments was 13.1% as of such date. As of September 30, 2016, the Company held equity investments in 85.2% of its portfolio companies and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those portfolio companies was
7.7%. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had active investments in 50 portfolio companies and residual investments in three portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. The aggregate fair value of the total portfolio was
$443,269 and the weighted average effective yield on the Company s debt investments of 13.3% as of such date. As of December 31, 2015, the Company held equity investments in 83.0% of its portfolio companies and the average fully diluted equity
ownership in those portfolio companies was 8.3%. The weighted average yields were computed using the effective interest rates for debt investments at cost as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including accretion of original issue discount
and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any.    Purchases of debt and equity investments for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, totaled $104,379 and $80,127, respectively. Proceeds from sales and repayments, including principal, return of capital distributions and realized gains, of portfolio investments for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and 2015 totaled $91,936 and $51,490, respectively.   Investments by type with corresponding percentage of total
portfolio investments consisted of the following:

  All investments made by the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were made
in portfolio companies headquartered in the U.S. The following table shows portfolio composition by geographic region at fair value and cost and as a percentage of total investments. The geographic composition is determined by the location of the
corporate headquarters of the portfolio company, which may not be indicative of the primary source of the portfolio company s business.      
   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no portfolio company investments that
represented more than 10% of the total investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had debt investments in one portfolio company on non-accrual status, which had an aggregate cost and fair value of $20,035 and $10,001, respectively,
as of such date. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had debt investments in one portfolio company on non-accrual status, which had an aggregate cost and fair value of $5,203 and $618, respectively, as of such date.

Value Measurements      Investments   
 The Board has established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a
recurring basis in accordance with ASC Topic 820 and consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Fair value is the price, determined at the measurement date, that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation
techniques described below are applied. Under ASC Topic 820, portfolio investments recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are classified within the fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the
inputs used to measure their value, as defined below:     Level 1    Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets as of the measurement date.     Level 2    Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, or
that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the investment.  
  Level 3    Inputs include those that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.  
 An investment s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. The Company s investment portfolio is comprised entirely of debt and equity securities of privately held companies for which quoted prices falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are not available.
Therefore, the Company values all of its portfolio investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by the Board, using Level 3 inputs. The degree of judgment exercised by the Board in determining fair value is greatest for investments
classified as Level 3 inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair values of investments that do not have readily available market values, the Board s estimate of fair values may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences may be material. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the
investments may cause the amounts ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned.  
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each
quarter, as described below:      

the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the Investment Advisor responsible for the portfolio investment;

preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee of the Investment Advisor;        

the Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of
our portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Each portfolio company investment is generally appraised by the valuation firm(s) at least once every calendar year and each new portfolio company
    
      25

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   
  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       

investment is appraised at least once in the twelve-month period following the initial investment. In certain instances, the Company may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result
it is not in the Company s stockholders  best interest, to request the independent appraisal of certain portfolio company investments. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the Company determines that the fair
value of the portfolio company investment is relatively insignificant to the fair value of the total portfolio. The Board consulted with the independent valuation firm(s) in arriving at the Company s determination of fair value for 13 and 16 of
its portfolio company investments representing 27.7% and 43.0% of the total portfolio investments at fair value (exclusive of new portfolio company investments made during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.         

the audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of the Investment Advisor and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments;
and        

the Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the Investment Advisor, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit
committee.      In making the good faith determination of the value of portfolio investments, the Board starts with the cost
basis of the security. The transaction price is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. When evidence supports a subsequent change to the carrying value from the original transaction price, adjustments are made to reflect the
expected exit values.    Consistent with the policies and methodologies adopted by the Board, the Company performs detailed valuations of
its debt and equity investments, including an analysis on the Company s unfunded loan commitments, using both the market and income approaches as appropriate. Under the market approach, the Company typically uses the enterprise value
methodology to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which the Company
derives a single estimate of enterprise value. Under the income approach, the Company typically prepares and analyzes discounted cash flow models to estimate the present value of future cash flows of either an individual debt investment or of the
underlying portfolio company itself.    The Company evaluates investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company
financial statements and forecasts. The Company also consults with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product
development and other operational issues.    For the Company s debt investments, including senior secured loans and subordinated notes,
the primary valuation technique used to estimate the fair value is the discounted cash flow method. However, if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, the Company may consider other methods in determining
the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. The Company s discounted cash flow models estimate a
range of fair values by applying an appropriate discount rate to the future cash flow streams of its debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. The Company prepares a weighted
average cost of capital for use in the discounted cash flow model for each investment, based on factors including, but not limited to: current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed or executed investment transactions of private companies;
the portfolio company s historical financial results and outlook; and the portfolio company s current leverage and credit quality as compared to leverage and credit quality as of the date the investment was made. The Company may also
consider the following factors when determining the fair value of debt investments: the portfolio company s ability to make future scheduled payments; prepayment penalties and other fees; estimated remaining life; the nature and realizable
value of any collateral securing such debt investment; and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made. The Company estimates the remaining life of its
debt investments to generally be the legal maturity date of the instrument, as the Company generally intends to hold its loans to maturity. However, if the Company has information available to it that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near
term, it would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date.    For the Company s equity investments, including
equity and warrants, the Company generally uses a market approach, including valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice, to estimate the enterprise value of portfolio companies. Typically, the enterprise value of a private company is
based on multiples of EBITDA, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the Company analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to
original transaction multiples, the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any
collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Where applicable, the Company considers the Company s ability to influence the capital structure of the
portfolio company, as well as the timing of a potential exit.

  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       
  The Company may also utilize an income approach when estimating the fair value of its equity
securities, either as a primary methodology if consistent with industry practice or if the market approach is otherwise not applicable, or as a supporting methodology to corroborate the fair value ranges determined by the market approach. The
Company typically prepares and analyzes discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows (or earnings) of the portfolio company. The Company considers various factors, including but not limited to the portfolio
company s projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer
companies that are public.    The fair value of the Company s royalty rights are calculated based on projected future cash flows and
the specific provisions contained in the pertinent agreements. The determination of the fair value of such royalty rights is not a significant component of the Company s valuation process.  
 The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Reclassifications impacting Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy are reported as transfers in or out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur. There were no transfers among Levels 1, 2, and 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.    The following tables present a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for fair valued investments measured using
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of $(3,160) and $3,945 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, was attributable to Level 3 investments held at September 30, 2016. Net change in unrealized (depreciation) of $(3,140) and $(3,958) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
respectively, were attributable to Level 3 investments held at September 30, 2015.

  The following tables summarize the significant unobservable inputs by valuation technique
used to determine the fair value of the Company s Level 3 debt and equity investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The tables are not intended to be all-inclusive, but instead capture the significant unobservable inputs
relevant to the Company s determination of fair values.      
   The significant unobservable input used in determining the fair value under the discounted cash flow technique
is the weighted average cost of capital of each security. Significant increases (or decreases) in this input would likely result in a significantly lower (or higher) fair value estimate.  
 The significant unobservable inputs used in determining fair value under the enterprise value technique are revenue and EBITDA multiples, as
well as asset coverage. Significant increases (or decreases) in these inputs could result in significantly higher (or lower) fair value estimates.  
  Other Financial Assets and Liabilities   
 ASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value. The Company
believes that the carrying amounts of its other financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate the fair value of such items due to the short maturity of such instruments. The fair value of borrowings
under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 6) are based on a market yield approach and current interest rates, which are level 3 inputs to the market yield model, and is estimated to be $15,500 as of December 31, 2015, which is the same as the
Company s carrying value of the borrowings. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. The fair value of SBA debentures is estimated by discounting remaining payments using current market rates for
similar instruments and considering such factors as the legal maturity date and the ability of market participants to prepay the debentures. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Company s SBA debentures using
Level 3 inputs is estimated at $214,000 and $213,500, respectively, which is the same as the Company s carrying value of the debentures.     Note 5.
Related Party Transactions      Investment Advisory Agreement:  Concurrent with the Formation Transactions, the Company entered into
the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor. On June 2, 2016, the Board approved the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement through June 20, 2017. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement and subject to the overall
supervision of the Board, the Investment Advisor provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Advisor receives a fee, consisting of two components   a base management fee and an incentive
fee.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   
  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       
  The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% based on the average value
of total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management
fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $2,055, and $1,920, respectively. The base management fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 totaled $6,043, and $5,575, respectively.    The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable
quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as
commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating
expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (defined below) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee,
excise taxes on realized gains and any deferred organizing and offering costs). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market discount, debt instruments with
payment-in-kind income, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities), accrued income the Company has not yet received in cash. The Investment Advisor is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the
incentive fee it receives that was based on accrued interest that the Company never collects.    Pre-incentive fee net investment income
does not include any realized capital gains, taxes associated with such realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the
Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company generates pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the
applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to a net loss on investments.    Pre-incentive fee net
investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s weighted average net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed  hurdle rate  of 2.0% per quarter. If market interest rates rise, the Company may be able to invest funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would
increase the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Investment Advisor to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. The Company s pre-incentive fee
net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee.
   The Company pays the Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter
as follows:      

no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0%;    

100.0% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% in any
calendar quarter. This portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%) is referred to as the  catch-up  provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Advisor with
20.0% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and        

20.0% of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter.    
 The sum of the calculations above equals the income incentive fee. The income incentive fee is appropriately prorated for any period of less
than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the calendar quarter. The income incentive fee for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $1,770 and $1,679, respectively. The income incentive fee for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $5,178 and $4,758, respectively.    The second part of the incentive fee is a
capital gains incentive fee that is determined and paid in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.0% of the net capital gains as of the end of
the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee to be paid to the Investment Advisor, the Company calculates the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since the Formation
Transactions, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in the Company s portfolio. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains
that serves as the basis for the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee to be paid equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital

  (In thousands, except shares and per share data)       
  
gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to the Company s portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at
the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee to be paid for such year equals 20.0% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the capital gains incentive fee payable was $0. The aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid from the IPO through September 30, 2016 is $348.  
 In addition, the Company accrues, but does not pay, a capital gains incentive fee in connection with any unrealized capital appreciation, as
appropriate. If, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized gains/(losses) plus net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) decreases during a period, the Company will reverse any excess capital gains incentive fee previously accrued such that
the amount of capital gains incentive fee accrued is no more than 20.0% of the sum of net realized gains/(losses) plus net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued capital
gains incentive fees of $372 and $2,034, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reversed previously accrued capital gains incentive fees of $313 and $236, respectively.  
 The sum of the income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee is the incentive fee and is reported in the consolidated statements of
operations. Accrued management fees, income incentive fees and capital gains incentive fees are reported in the due to affiliates line in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.  
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually
by the Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of the Independent Directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement
automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Investment Advisor and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days  written notice to the other. The holders of a
majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty.  
  Administration Agreement:  Concurrent with the Formation Transactions, the Company also entered into an administration agreement (the
 Administration Agreement ) with the Investment Advisor. On June 2, 2016, the Board approved the renewal of the Administrative Agreement through June 20, 2017. Under the Administration Agreement, the Investment Advisor furnishes the
Company with office facilities and equipment, provides it clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides the Company with other administrative services necessary to conduct its day-to-day operations. The Company
reimburses the Investment Advisor for the allocable portion of overhead expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of its chief financial
officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Under the Administration Agreement, the Investment Advisor also provides managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which the Company is required to provide such assistance
and the Company reimburses the Investment Advisor for fees and expenses incurred with providing such services. In addition, the Company reimburses the Investment Advisor for fees and expenses incurred while performing due diligence on the
Company s prospective portfolio companies. Under the Administration Agreement, administrative expenses for services provided for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 totaled $356 and $362, respectively. Under the Administration
Agreement, administrative expenses for services provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 totaled $1,044 and $1,077, respectively. Accrued administrative expenses are reported in the due to affiliates line on the consolidated
statements of assets and liabilities.     Note 6. Debt   
  Revolving Credit Facility : On June 16, 2014, FIC entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the  Credit
Facility ) with ING Capital LLC ( ING ), as the administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender. The Credit Facility had an initial commitment of $30,000 with an accordion feature that allows for an increase in the total
commitments up to $75,000, subject to certain conditions and the satisfaction of specified financial covenants. The Credit Facility is secured by certain portfolio investments held by the Company, but portfolio investments held by the Funds are not
collateral for the Credit Facility. The stated maturity date for the Credit Facility is June 16, 2018, which may be extended by mutual agreement.  
 On December 19, 2014, FIC amended the Credit Facility to (i) increase the commitment from $30,000 to $50,000 (ii) allow FIC to buy-back up to
$10,000 of the Company s common stock subject to the satisfaction of specified financial covenants and conditions. The Credit Facility continues to have an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total commitment up to $75,000.
   Amounts available to borrow under the Credit Facility are subject to a minimum borrowing/collateral base that applies an advance rate to
certain investments held by the Company. The Company is subject to limitations with respect to the investments securing the Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, restrictions on sector concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and
status and collateral interests, as well as restrictions on portfolio company leverage, which may also affect the borrowing base and therefore amounts available to borrow.

  Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to the Company s election,
on a per annum basis equal to (i) the alternate base rate plus 2.5% or (ii) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, which varies depending on the period of the borrowing under the Credit Facility, plus 3.5%. The alternate base rate
is equal to the greater of (i) prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the three-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. The Company pays a commitment fee between 0.5% and 1.0% per annum based on the size of the unused portion of the Credit
Facility.    The Company has made customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting
requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company was in compliance in all material respect with the terms of the Credit Facility.    As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $0 and $15,500, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest and fees related to the Credit Facility amounted to $128 and $196,
respectively, which are included in interest and financing expenses on the consolidated statements of operation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest and fees related to the Credit Facility amounted to $490 and $505,
respectively, which are included in interest and financing expenses on the consolidated statements of operation. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest and fees payable related to the Credit Facility totaled $0 and $101,
respectively.     SBA debentures:  The Company uses debenture leverage provided through the SBA to fund a portion of its investment
purchases.    Under the SBA debenture program, the SBA commits to purchase debentures issued by SBICs and such debentures are guaranteed by
the SBA. The SBA has made commitments to purchase $275,000 of SBA debentures from the Company on or before September 30, 2020. Unused commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $61,000 and $11,500, respectively. The SBA may
limit the amount that may be drawn each year under these commitments, and each issuance of leverage is conditioned on the Company s full compliance, as determined by the SBA, with the terms and conditions set forth in the SBIC Act.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s issued and outstanding SBA debentures mature as follows:  

(1) 
 The SBA has two scheduled pooling dates for debentures (in March and in September). Certain debentures funded during the reporting periods may not be pooled until the subsequent pooling date.    
 Interest on SBA debentures is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, interest and fees on outstanding SBA debentures amounted to $2,243 and $1,938, respectively, which are

included in interest and financing expenses on the consolidated statements of operation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest and fees on outstanding SBA debentures
amounted to $6,588 and $5,576, respectively, which are included in interest and financing expenses on the consolidated statements of operation. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest and fees payable related to the SBA
debentures totaled $731 and $2,739, respectively.     Deferred Financing Costs   
 Deferred financing costs are amortized into interest and financing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations using the effective
interest method, over the term of the respective financing instrument. Deferred financing cost amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $277 and $254, respectively. Deferred financing cost amortization for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $824 and $740, respectively. Deferred financing costs related to the Credit Facility and SBA debentures as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:  
   
   Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a direct offset to the SBA debentures and Credit
Facility liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The following table summarizes the outstanding debt net of unamortized deferred financing costs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
   
   The weighted average interest rate for all SBA debentures and borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 4.2 % and 4.0%, respectively.     Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies   
  Commitments:  The Company had outstanding commitments to fund various undrawn revolving loans, other credit facilities and capital
commitments totaling $7,066 and $10,150 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Such outstanding commitments are summarized in the following table:

  Additional detail for each of the commitments above is provided in the Company s
consolidated schedules of investments.    The commitments are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance
with financial and nonfinancial covenants. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
  Indemnifications:  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of
representations and warranties that provide indemnifications under certain circumstances. In addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, the Company may be required to make representations about the business
and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. The Company may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are
inaccurate. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. The Company expects the risk of future obligation under these
indemnifications to be remote.     Legal proceedings:  In the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to legal and
regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.     Note 8. Common Stock

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.      The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with Fidus Investment Corporation s consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ) on March 3, 2016. The information contained in this section should also be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q.      Except as otherwise specified, references to  we,   us,   our,   Fidus  and
 FIC  refer to Fidus Investment Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.      Forward Looking Statements   
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking
statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Fidus Investment Corporation, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words
such as  anticipates,   expects,   intends,   plans,   will,   may,   continue,   believes,   seeks,   estimates,   would, 
 could,   should,   targets,   projects  and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:      

our future operating results;        

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;        

the impact of investments that we expect to make;        

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;        

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;        

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;        

our expected financing and investments;        

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; and        

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies.      These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:      

an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies  ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies;    

a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities;    

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy;    

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than the U.S. dollars; and,

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in  Item 1A.   Risk Factors  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.      Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking
statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate
new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in  Item 1.A   Risk Factors  contained in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2016. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

   Overview   
 We provide customized debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle-market companies, which we define as U.S. based companies having
revenues between $10.0 million and $150.0 million. Our investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating both current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity related investments. Our
investment strategy includes partnering with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors by providing customized financing for ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion and other growth
initiatives. We seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments in order to help mitigate the potential effects of adverse economic events related to particular companies, regions or industries.  
 FIC was formed as a Maryland corporation on February 14, 2011. We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2011, and
completed additional underwritten public offerings of our common stock in September 2012, February 2013, September 2014 and May 2016 providing approximately $217.8 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs.  
 On June 20, 2011, FIC acquired all of the limited partnership interests of Fund I and membership interests of FMCGP through the Formation
Transactions, resulting in Fund I becoming our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiary. Immediately following the Formation Transactions, we and Fund I elected to be treated as BDCs under the 1940 Act and our investment activities have been managed by Fidus
Investment Advisors, LLC, our investment advisor, and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us. On March 29, 2013, we commenced operations of a second wholly-owned subsidiary, Fund II. Fund I and Fund II are
collectively referred to as the  Funds.     Fund I received its SBIC license on October 22, 2007 and Fund II received its
SBIC license on May 28, 2013. We plan to continue to operate the Funds as SBICs, subject to SBA approval, and to utilize the proceeds of the sale of SBA-guaranteed debentures to enhance returns to our stockholders. We have also made, and continue to
make, investments directly through FIC. We believe that utilizing FIC and the Funds as investment vehicles provides us with access to a broader array of investment opportunities. Based on the current capitalization of the Funds, we have
approximately $61.0 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the SBIC Debenture Program and intend to fully utilize such capacity over the ensuing 12-18 months.  
  Revenues : We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity
investments. Our debt investments, whether in the form of mezzanine, senior secured or unitranche loans, typically have terms of five to seven years and bear interest at a fixed rate but may bear interest at a floating rate. In some instances, we
receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates. The frequency or volume of these
repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity may reflect the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans
and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, or structuring fees and fees for providing managerial assistance. Loan origination
fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium, if any, are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Interest and dividend income is recorded on
the accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. Loans or preferred equity securities are placed on non-accrual status when principal, interest or dividend payments become materially past due, or when there is reasonable doubt
that principal, interest or dividends will be collected. See  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates   Revenue Recognition.  Interest and dividend income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and
contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments. Interest is accrued on a daily basis. Dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution.
Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is a distribution of earnings or a return of capital.  
 We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis
of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.     Expenses : All investment professionals of our
investment advisor and/or its affiliates, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses allocable to personnel who provide these services to us, are
provided and paid for by our investment advisor and not by us. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to:  

organization;        

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);        

fees and expenses incurred by our investment advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement or payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us
and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments;

  Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we invested $104.4 million in debt and equity investments, including six new portfolio
companies. These investments consisted of subordinated notes ($71.4 million, or 68.4%), senior secured loans ($27.8 million, or 26.6%), equity securities ($5.0 million, or 4.8%) and warrant securities ($0.2 million, or 0.2%). During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 we received proceeds from sales or repayments, including principal, return of capital dividends and net realized gains (losses), of $91.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we invested $80.1
million in debt and equity investments, including eight new portfolio companies. These investments consisted of subordinated notes ($56.0 million, or 69.9%), senior secured loans ($18.4 million, or 23.0%), equity securities ($5.5 million, or 6.9%),
and warrants ($0.2 million, or 0.2%). During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we received proceeds from sales or repayments, including principal, return of capital dividends and net realized gains (losses), of $51.5 million.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $470.1 million and consisted of 49 active portfolio companies and
five portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. As of September 30, 2016, one debt investment bore interest at a variable rate, which represented $8.3 million of our portfolio on a fair value basis, and the remainder of our debt
portfolio was comprised of fixed rate investments. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of $11.0 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, our average active portfolio company investment at amortized cost was $9.4
million, which excludes investments in the five portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations.    As of December 31,
2015, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $443.3 million and consisted of 50 active portfolio companies and three portfolio companies that have sold their underlying operations. As of December 31, 2015, one debt investment bore
interest at a variable rate, which represented $8.9 million of our portfolio on a fair value basis, and the remainder of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate investments. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $5.1
million as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our average active portfolio company investment at amortized cost was $9.0 million, which excludes investments in the three portfolio companies that have sold their underlying
operations.    The weighted average yield on debt investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 13.1% and 13.3%,
respectively. The weighted average yields were computed using the effective interest rates for debt investments at cost as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including the accretion of original issue discount and loan origination
fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any.

   Portfolio Asset Quality   
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment advisor uses an internally developed investment rating system to
characterize and monitor the credit profile and our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. We use a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating:

Investment Rating 1 is used for investments that involve the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The portfolio company is performing above expectations and the trends and risk factors are favorable, and may include
an expected capital gain.        

Investment Rating 2 is used for investments that involve a level of risk similar to the risk at the time of origination. The portfolio company is performing substantially within our expectations and the risk factors are
neutral or favorable. Each new portfolio investment enters our portfolio with Investment Rating 2.        

Investment Rating 3 is used for investments performing below expectations and indicates the investment s risk has increased somewhat since origination. The portfolio company requires closer monitoring, but we
expect a full return of principal and collection of all interest and/or dividends.        

Investment Rating 4 is used for investments performing materially below expectations and the risk has increased materially since origination. The portfolio company has the potential for some loss of investment return,
but we expect no loss of principal.        

Investment Rating 5 is used for investments performing substantially below our expectations and the risks have increased substantially since origination. We expect some loss of principal.    
 The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   Based on our investment rating system, the weighted average rating of our portfolio as of both September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 was 2.0 on a fair value basis.     Non-Accrual   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had a debt investment in one portfolio company on non-accrual status, which had an aggregate cost and fair value
of $20.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had debt investments in one portfolio company on non-accrual status, which had an aggregate cost and fair value of $5.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized unrealized depreciation on non-accrual investments held as of September
30, 2016 of $2.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized unrealized depreciation on non-accrual investments held as of September 30, 2015 of $0.7 million and $3.8 million,
respectively.     Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations   
   Comparison of three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
  Investment Income     For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, total investment income was $14.4 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 6.4%, over the $13.6 million of total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to
a $1.0 million increase in fee income resulting from a higher level of investment activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and a $0.4 million increase in dividend income due to
increased levels of distributions received from equity investments, which were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in interest income resulting from the reversal of uncollectible interest income on a non-accrual debt investment.

   Expenses   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total expenses, including income tax provision, were $7.7 million, an increase of $1.2 million
or 18.3%, over the $6.5 million of total expenses, including income tax provision, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest and financing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.6 million, an increase of
$0.3 million or 10.9%, compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of higher average balances of SBA debentures and borrowings under the Credit Facility outstanding during 2016. The base management fee
increased $0.1 million, or 7.0%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to higher average total assets less cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2016 than the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The incentive fee for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.1 million, a $0.8 million, or 56.8%, increase from the $1.4 million incentive fee for the three months ended September 30, 2015 which was primarily the
result of a $0.7 million increase in the capital gains incentive fee to $0.4 million. The administrative service fee, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.8 million for both the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.     Net Investment Income   
 Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.7 million, which was a decrease of $0.3 million, or 4.5%, compared
to net investment income of $7.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the $0.9 million increase in total investment income and the $1.2 million increase in total expenses, including income tax provision.  
  Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the total net realized (loss) on investments was $(6.0) million. Significant realized gains and

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net change in unrealized appreciation on
investments of $7.8 million attributable to (i) the reversal of net unrealized depreciation of $11.0 million related to the exit or sale of investments, resulting in unrealized appreciation, (ii) net unrealized depreciation of $1.7 million on debt
investments and (iii) net unrealized depreciation of $1.5 million on equity investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation on investments of $3.2 million attributable to (i)
the reversal of net unrealized appreciation on investments of $0.1 million related to the exit or sale of investments, resulting in unrealized depreciation, (ii) net unrealized depreciation of $4.1 million on debt investments and (iii) net
unrealized appreciation of $1.0 million on equity investments.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no income tax
provision for realized gains on investments was recorded.

  As a result of these events, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $8.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 56.6%, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $5.5 million during the prior year period.  
   Comparison of nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015    
  Investment Income     For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, total investment income was $43.0 million, an increase of $3.8 million, or 9.6%, over the $39.2 million of total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was attributable to a
$1.7 million increase in interest income resulting largely from higher average levels of debt investments outstanding, a $1.1 million increase in dividend income due to increased levels of distributions received from equity investments and a $0.9
million increase in fee income resulting from increased investment activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.  
  Expenses     For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, total expenses, including income tax provision, were $24.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million or 21.7%, over the $19.9 million of total expenses, including income tax provision, for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Interest and financing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $7.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 15.8%, compared to $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of higher average
balances of SBA debentures and borrowings under the Credit Facility outstanding during 2016. The base management fee increased $0.5 million, or 8.4%, to $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to higher average total assets
less cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 than the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The incentive fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.2 million, a $2.7 million, or 59.5%, increase from the
$4.5 million incentive fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which was primarily the result of a $2.3 million increase in the capital gains incentive fee to $2.0 million. The administrative service fee, professional fees and other general
and administrative expenses totaled $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Net Investment Income   
 Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18.8 million, which was a decrease of $0.6 million, or 2.9%, compared
to net investment income of $19.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the $3.8 million increase in total investment income and the $4.3 million increase in total expenses, including income tax provision.  
  Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net change in unrealized
appreciation on investments of $16.1 million attributable to (i) the reversal of net unrealized depreciation on investments of $12.1 million related to the exit or sale of investments, resulting in unrealized appreciation, (ii) net unrealized
depreciation of $7.5 million on debt investments and (iii) net unrealized appreciation of $11.5 million on equity investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation on investments
of $8.1 million attributable to (i) the reversal of net unrealized appreciation on investments of $4.2 million related to the exit or sale of investments, resulting in unrealized depreciation, (ii) net unrealized depreciation of $7.9
million on debt investments and (iii) net unrealized appreciation of $3.9 million on equity investments.    During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $0.2 million income tax provision for expected income taxes due from realized gains on investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, no income tax provision for realized gains on investments
was recorded.    As a result of these events, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $28.9 million, or an increase of $10.8 million, or 59.4%, compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $18.1 million during the prior year period.  
   Liquidity and Capital Resources    
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $42.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net assets totaled $299.3 million. We believe that our
current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our continued access to SBA-guaranteed debentures, our Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will provide adequate capital resources with which to operate and finance our investment
business and make distributions to our stockholders for at least the next 12 months. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from the future offerings of securities (including the ATM Program) and future borrowings, as well as cash flows
from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders.  
  Cash Flows     For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $10.5 million. During that period, we received $3.0 million of cash from operating activities, which included proceeds received from sales
and repayments of investments of $91.9 million, which were offset by the funding of $104.4 million of investments. During the same period, we received net proceeds from a secondary offering of shares of our common stock off of our effective shelf
registration statement of $43.7 million and proceeds from the issuances of SBA debenture of $0.5 million, which were partially offset by net repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facility of $15.5 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders
of $20.6 million.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount
of $11.6 million. During that period, we used $16.5 million of cash for operating activities, primarily for the funding of $80.1 million of investments, which was partially offset by the proceeds from sales and repayments of investments of $51.5
million. During the same period, we received $4.9 million for financing activities resulting from proceeds received from stock offerings, net of expenses, of $3.2 million, proceeds from the issuance of SBA debentures of $16.7 million and net
borrowings under the Credit Facility of $4.5 million, which were partially offset by cash dividends paid to stockholders of $18.3 million and the payment of deferred financing costs totaling $1.3 million.  
  Capital Resources     We
anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities on a long-term basis through a combination of additional debt and equity capital.  
 The Funds are licensed SBICs, and have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates. Under the Small
Business Investment Act and the SBA rules applicable to SBICs, an SBIC can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the SBA in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital. The SBA regulations currently limit the amount that is
available to be borrowed by any SBIC and guaranteed by the SBA to 200.0% of an SBIC s regulatory capital or $150.0 million, whichever is less. For three or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA debentures cannot
exceed $350.0 million. SBA debentures have fixed interest rates that approximate prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the SBA debentures is
not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre-paid at any time. As of September 30, 2016, Fund I had $150.0 million of outstanding SBA debentures and cannot issue additional SBA debentures. As of September 30, 2016, Fund II had $64.0
million of  
      44  

Table of Contents  

outstanding SBA debentures. Fund II has the current capacity to issue up to an additional $61.0 million of SBA debentures. Subject to SBA regulatory requirements and approval, we may access up to
$75.0 million of additional SBA debentures under the SBIC Debenture Program. For more information on the SBA debentures, please see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2014, we entered into the Credit Facility to provide additional funding for our investment and operational activities. The Credit
Facility, which matures on June 16, 2018, had an initial commitment of $30.0 million and an accordion feature that allows for an increase in the total commitments up to $75.0 million, subject to certain customary conditions. The Credit Facility is
secured primarily by our assets, excluding the assets of the Funds.   On December 19, 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to (i) increase
the commitment from $30.0 million to $50.0 million (ii) allow FIC to buy-back up to $10.0 million of our common stock subject to the satisfaction of specified financial covenants and conditions. The Credit Facility continues to have an accordion
feature which allows for an increase in the total commitment up to $75.0 million.    Amounts available to borrow under the Credit Facility
are subject to a minimum borrowing/collateral base that applies an advance rate to certain portfolio investments. We are subject to limitations with respect to the investments securing the Credit Facility, including, but not limited to, restrictions
on sector concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status and collateral interests, as well as restrictions on portfolio company leverage, which may also affect the borrowing base and therefore amounts available to borrow.  
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to our election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) the alternate base rate plus
2.5% or (ii) the applicable LIBOR, which varies depending on the period of the borrowing under the Credit Facility, plus 3.5%. The alternate base rate is equal to the greater of (i) prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the
three-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% per annum based on the size of the unused portion of the Credit Facility.  
 We have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other
customary requirements for similar credit facilities. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all
covenants of the Credit Facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.    As of September 30, 2016, the
weighted average interest rate for all SBA debentures and borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility was 4.2%.    As a BDC, we are
generally required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200.0%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We have
received exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, to allow us to exclude any indebtedness guaranteed by the SBA and issued by the Funds from the 200.0% asset coverage requirements, which, in turn, will enable us to
fund more investments with debt capital.    As a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net
asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our board of directors, including
Independent Directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale. On June 2, 2016, our stockholders voted to allow us to sell or otherwise issue common stock at a price
below net asset value per share for a period of one year ending on the earlier of June 2, 2017 or the date of our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We expect to present to our stockholders a similar proposal at our 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. Our stockholders specified that the cumulative number of shares sold in each offering during the one-year period ending on the earlier of June 2, 2017 or the date of our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders may not exceed 25.0% of our
outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale.     Stock repurchase plan   
 We have an open market stock repurchase program (the  Program ) under which we may acquire up to $5.0 million of our outstanding
common stock. Under the Program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that we comply with the prohibitions under our insider trading policies and the requirements of Rule
10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market value and timing constraints. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by our management, in its discretion, based
upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, capital availability, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. Unless extended by the Board, the Company expected that the Program would have
been in effect until January 22, 2017, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. On November 1, 2016, the Board extended the Program through December 31, 2017. The Program does not require us to repurchase any
specific number of shares and the Company cannot assure that any shares will be repurchased under the Program. The Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. We did not make any repurchases of common stock during the
three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts
reported in the financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These
estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.     Valuation of Portfolio Investments    
 As a BDC, we report our assets and liabilities at fair value at all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act. Accordingly, we are required
to periodically determine the fair value of all of our portfolio investments.    Our investments generally consist of illiquid securities
including debt and equity investments in lower middle-market companies. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for
substantially all of the investments in our portfolio, we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation
process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a
readily available market value existed for such investments, and the difference could be material.    With respect to investments for which
market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:     

our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of our investment advisor responsible for the portfolio investment;

preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee of our investment advisor;        

our board of directors engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct independent appraisals of a selection of our portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Each
portfolio company investment is generally appraised by the valuation firm(s) at least once every calendar year and each new portfolio company investment is appraised at least once in the twelve-month period following the initial investment. In
certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result it is not in our stockholders  best interest, to request the independent appraisal of certain portfolio company investments. Such instances include, but are not
limited to, situations where we determine that the fair value of the portfolio company investment is relatively insignificant to the fair value of the total portfolio. Our board of directors consulted with the independent valuation firm(s) in
arriving at our determination of fair value for 13 and 16 of our portfolio company investments representing 27.7% and 43.0% of the total portfolio investments at fair value (exclusive of new portfolio company investments made during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively;        

the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of our investment advisor and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect
any comments; and        

our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our investment advisor, the independent valuation firm(s) and the
audit committee.      In making the good faith determination of the value of portfolio investments, we start with the cost basis
of the security. The transaction price is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. When evidence supports a subsequent change to the carrying value from the original transaction price, adjustments are made to reflect the expected exit
values.    Consistent with the policies and methodologies adopted by our board of directors, we perform detailed valuations of our debt and
equity investments, including an analysis on the Company s unfunded loan commitments, using both the market and income approaches as appropriate. Under the market approach, we typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair
value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise
value. Under the income approach, we typically prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models to estimate the present value of future cash flows of either an individual debt investment or of the underlying portfolio company itself.  
      46  

Table of Contents  

  We evaluate investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial
statements and forecasts. We also consult with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product development and other
operational issues.   For our debt investments, including senior secured loans and subordinated notes, the primary valuation technique used
to estimate the fair value is the discounted cash flow method. However, if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other methods in determining the fair value, including the value
attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. Our discounted cash flow models estimate a range of fair values by applying an appropriate
discount rate to the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. We prepare a weighted average cost of capital for use in the discounted cash flow
model for each investment, based on factors including, but not limited to: current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed or executed investment transactions of private companies; the portfolio company s historical financial results
and outlook; and the portfolio company s current leverage and credit quality as compared to leverage and credit quality as of the date the investment was made. We may also consider the following factors when determining the fair value of debt
investments: the portfolio company s ability to make future scheduled payments; prepayment penalties and other fees; estimated remaining life; the nature and realizable value of any collateral securing such debt investment; and changes in the
interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made. We estimate the remaining life of our debt investments to generally be the legal maturity date of the instrument, as we
generally intend to hold loans to maturity. However, if we have information available to us that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term, we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date.  
 For our equity investments, including equity securities and warrants, we generally use a market approach, including valuation methodologies
consistent with industry practice, to estimate the enterprise value of portfolio companies. Typically, the enterprise value of a private company is based on multiples of EBITDA, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. In estimating
the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyze various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results,
applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of
peer companies that are public. Where applicable, we consider our ability to influence the capital structure of the portfolio company, as well as the timing of a potential exit.  
 We may also utilize an income approach when estimating the fair value of our equity securities, either as a primary methodology if consistent
with industry practice or if the market approach is otherwise not applicable, or as a supporting methodology to corroborate the fair value ranges determined by the market approach. We typically prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models based
on projections of the future free cash flows (or earnings) of the portfolio company. We consider various factors, including but not limited to the portfolio company s projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction
comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public.  
 The fair value of our royalty rights are calculated based on projected future cash flows and the specific provisions contained in the
pertinent royalty agreement. The determination of the fair value of such royalty rights is not a significant component of our valuation process.  
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements
express the uncertainties with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any changes in such valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.  
   Revenue Recognition    
  Investments and related investment income.  Realized gains or losses on investments are recorded upon the sale or disposition of a
portfolio investment and are calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or disposition and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in
unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the consolidated statements of operations includes changes in the fair value of investments from the prior period, as determined by our board of directors through the application of our valuation policy, as
well as reclassifications of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments to realized gains or losses on investments.  
  Interest and dividend income . Interest and dividend income are recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect
such amounts. Interest and dividend income is accrued daily based on the outstanding principal amount and the contractual terms of the debt or preferred equity investment. Dividend income is recorded at the point an obligation exists for the
portfolio company to make a distribution. Distributions from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is a distribution of earnings or a return of capital.  
      47  

Table of Contents  

   Payment-in-kind interest.  Certain of our investments contain a PIK income provision. The
PIK income, computed at the contractual rate specified in the applicable investment agreement, is added to the principal balance of the investment, rather than being paid in cash, and recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable, on the
consolidated statements of operations. Generally, PIK can be paid-in-kind or all in cash. We stop accruing PIK income when there is reasonable doubt that PIK income will be collected. PIK income is included in our taxable income and, therefore,
affects the amount we are required to pay to our stockholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC and to avoid paying corporate federal income tax, even though we have not yet collected the cash.  
  Non-accrual.  When there is reasonable doubt that principal, interest or dividends will be collected, loans or preferred equity
investments are placed on non-accrual status and we will generally cease recognizing interest or dividend income. Interest and dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as interest or dividend income or applied to the
investment principal balance based on management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal, interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current.  
  Warrants.  In connection with our debt investments, we will sometimes receive warrants or other equity-related securities, or Warrants.
We determine the cost basis of Warrants based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and Warrants received. Any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its
recorded fair value resulting from the assignment of value to the Warrants are treated as original issue discount, or OID, and accreted into interest income using the effective interest method over the term of the debt investment.  
  Fee income.  All transaction fees earned in connection with our investments are recognized as fee income. Such fees typically include
fees for services, including structuring and advisory services, provided to portfolio companies. We recognize income from fees for providing such structuring and advisory services when the services are rendered or the transactions are completed.
Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as fee income when earned. Prior to the Formation Transactions, and in accordance with the prior limited partnership agreement, we historically recorded
transaction fees provided in connection with our investments as a direct offset to management fee expense.    We also typically receive loan
origination or closing fees in connection with investments. Such loan origination and closing fees are capitalized as unearned income and offset against investment cost basis on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and accreted into
income over the life of the investment.     Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
 In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,
 Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which amends the criteria for determining which entities are considered variable interest entities ( VIEs ), amends the criteria for determining if a service provider
possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the deferral granted to investment companies for application of the VIE consolidation model. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 had no material impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of
interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
that debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 had no material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements other than corresponding reductions to total assets and total liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Prior to adoption, the Company recorded deferred financing costs as an asset on the
consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Upon adoption of ASU 2015-03, the Company reclassified these deferred costs to a direct offset of the related debt liability on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The new
guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company reclassified the $4,872 of deferred financing costs presented as an asset as of December 31, 2015 to a direct offset of the related debt liabilities as of such date
on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.    In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) . Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early
application is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial
position or disclosures.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows. This  
      48

guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently
evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial position or disclosures.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our
portfolio companies. We had off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of outstanding commitments to fund various undrawn revolving loans and other credit facilities totaling $7.1 million and $10.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. Such outstanding commitments are summarized in the following table:      
   Additional detail for each of the commitments above is provided in the Company s consolidated schedules
of investments.     Related Party Transactions   
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:  

In connection with the Formation Transactions, Fund I terminated its management services agreement with Fidus Capital, LLC and we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC, as
our investment advisor. The investment professionals of Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC were also the investment professionals of Fidus Capital, LLC. We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC to manage our
day-to-day operating and investing activities. We pay our investment advisor a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components   a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements.     Edward H. Ross, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas C. Lauer, our
President, are managers of Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC. In May 2015, Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC entered into a combination with Fidus Partners, LLC (the  Combination ), by which members of Fidus Investment Advisors LLC and Fidus
Partners, LLC ( Partners ) contributed all of their respective membership interest in Fidus Investment Advisors LLC and Partners to a newly formed limited liability company, Fidus Group Holdings, LLC ( Holdings ). As a result,
Fidus Investment Advisors LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, which is a newly formed limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware.      

We entered into the Administration Agreement with Fidus Investment Advisors, LLC to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations. See Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements.        

We entered into a license agreement with Fidus Partners, LLC, pursuant to which Fidus Partners, LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  Fidus.     
 In connection with the IPO and our election to be regulated as a BDC, we applied for and received exemptive relief from the SEC on March 27,
2012 to allow us to take certain actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the 1940 Act, as applicable to BDCs. The relief permits FIC and Fund I, each of which has elected to be treated as a BDC, to operate effectively as one company,
specifically allowing them to: (1) engage in certain transactions with each other; (2) invest in securities in which the  
      49  

Table of Contents  

other is or proposes to be an investor; (3) file consolidated reports with the Commission; and (4) be subject to modified consolidated asset coverage requirements for senior securities issued by
a BDC and its SBIC subsidiary. Fund II has not elected to be treated as a BDC and is not party to this exemptive relief. The fourth exemption described above allows us to exclude any indebtedness guaranteed by the SBA and issued by Fund I from the
200.0% asset coverage requirements applicable to us. Effective September 30, 2014, any SBA debentures issued by Fund II are not considered senior securities for purposes of the 200.0% asset coverage requirements.  
 While we may co-invest with investment entities managed by our investment advisor or its affiliates, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, the 1940 Act imposes significant limits on co-investment. As a result, on January 27, 2016, we filed an exemptive application with the SEC to permit us to co-invest with funds or entities managed by our
investment adviser in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. Any such order, if granted by the SEC, will be subject to certain terms and conditions. Furthermore, there is no assurance
when, or if, this application for exemptive relief will be granted by the SEC.    In addition, we, Fund I and our investment advisor have
each adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that governs the conduct of our and our investment advisor s officers, directors and employees. Additionally, our investment advisor has adopted a code of ethics
pursuant to rule 240A-1 under the 1940 Act and in accordance with Rule 17j-1(c). We, and Fund I, have also adopted a code of business conduct that is applicable to all officers, directors and employees of Fidus and our investment advisor. Our
officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law.     Recent Developments
    On October 4, 2016, we exited our investment in Premium Franchise Brands, LLC and recognized a gain of approximately $1.1 million on
our preferred equity investment.    On October 13, 2016, we restructured our subordinated note investment in Pinnergy, Ltd. As part of the
restructuring, we converted $3.0 million of our subordinated note investment into an equity investment in Pinnergy, Ltd. and recognized a loss of approximately $8.9 million on our subordinated note investment. In addition, we made a $3.0 million
investment in additional equity interests of Pinnergy, Ltd.    On October 25, 2016, we restructured our debt investment in K2 Industrial
Services, Inc. As part of the restructuring, we received payment in full on our existing subordinated note and reinvested $12.0 million in new subordinated notes.  
 On November 1, 2016, the Board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share payable on December 16, 2016 to stockholders of record
as of December 2, 2016. In addition, on November 1, 2016, the Board declared a special dividend of $0.04 per share payable on December 16, 2016 to stockholders of record as of December 2, 2016.  
 On November 3, 2016, we invested $9.9 million in senior secured notes and common equity of Palmetto Moon, LLC, a retailer of apparel,
giftware, and accessories.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect both our cost of funding and
the valuation of our investment portfolio. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable
administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. In the future, our investment income may also be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and prime rates, to the extent of any debt investments that
include floating interest rates. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, one debt investment bore interest at a variable rate, which represented $8.3 million and $8.9 million of our portfolio on a fair value basis, respectively, and the
remainder of our debt portfolio was comprised entirely of fixed rate investments. Assuming that the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were to remain constant, a hypothetical 100 basis
point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our level of interest income from debt investments. Our pooled SBA debentures bear interest at fixed rates. Our Credit Facility bears interest, subject to our election, on a per
annum basis equal to (i) the alternate base rate plus 2.5% or (ii) the applicable LIBOR, which varies depending on the period of the borrowing under the Credit Facility, plus 3.5%. The alternate base rate is equal to the greater of (i) prime rate,
(ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the three-month LIBOR plus 1.0%.    Because we currently borrow, and plan to borrow in the
future, money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant
change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding
increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio.

     Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
 Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, we
are currently not a party to any pending material legal proceedings.       Item 1A. Risk Factors.   
 In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the  Risk Factors  discussed in our
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and filed with the SEC on March 3, 2016, which are incorporated herein by reference. These Risk Factors could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  
    Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   
 We have an open market stock repurchase program (the  Program ) under which we may acquire up to $5.0 million of our outstanding
common stock. Under the Program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that we comply with the prohibitions under our insider trading policies and the requirements of Rule
10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market value and timing constraints. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by our management, in its discretion, based
upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, capital availability, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. Unless extended by the Board, the Company expected that the Program would have
been in effect until January 22, 2017, or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. On November 1, 2016, the Board extended the Program through December 31, 2017. The Program does not require us to repurchase any
specific number of shares and the Company cannot assure that any shares will be repurchased under the Program. The Program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. We did not make any repurchases of common stock during the
three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
