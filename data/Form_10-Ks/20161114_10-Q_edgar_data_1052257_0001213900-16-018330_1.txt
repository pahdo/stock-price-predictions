NOTE
1   NATURE OF BUSINESS    

Agritech
Worldwide, Inc., formerly known as Z Trim Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), is an agricultural technology company that
owns and develops products and processes for use in the food and industrial markets. The Company currently sells a line of
products to the food industry that can help food manufacturers reduce their costs and help them solve many production problems.
The Company s technology provides value-added ingredients across virtually all food industry categories. The Company s
all-natural products, among other things, help to reduce fat and calories, add fiber, provide shelf-stability, prevent oil migration,
and add binding capacity   all without degrading the taste and texture of the final food products. Perhaps most significantly,
the Company s products can help extend the shelf life of finished products, and thereby potentially increasing customers 
gross margins. The Company s industrial division, opened in 2012, plans to sell eco-friendly ingredients to oil drilling,
hydraulic fracturing, petroleum coke, steel/aluminum, paper and other industries. The Company s industrial ingredients
are highly functional in applications for adhesives, binders, viscofiers and emulsifiers.  

The
Company was originally incorporated in the State of Illinois on May 5, 1994 under the name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd. On
June 21, 2006, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation and changed its name to Z Trim
Holdings Inc. On March 23, 2016, the Company changed its state of incorporation by engaging in a merger (the  Reincorporation )
with and into its newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Agritech Worldwide, Inc., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to the terms
and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by Z Trim and Agritech on March 18, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ).
The Reincorporation was consummated on March 23, 2016 and was effectuated by the filing of (i) articles of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Nevada, and (ii) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. The Reincorporation
effected a change in the Company s legal domicile from Illinois to Nevada. Upon the effectiveness of the Reincorporation
the Company s affairs ceased to be governed by (i) Illinois corporation laws, (ii) Illinois Articles of Incorporation, and
(iii) Illinois Bylaws, and its affairs became subject to (a) Nevada corporation laws, (b) Agritech s Articles of Incorporation
of and (c) Agritech s Bylaws. The resulting Nevada corporation (i) is deemed to be the same entity as the Illinois corporation
for all purposes under the laws of Nevada, (ii) continues to have all of the rights, privileges and powers of the Illinois corporation,
(iii) continues to possess all properties of the Illinois corporation, and (iv) continues to have all of the debts, liabilities
and obligations of the Illinois corporation.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN    

These financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company has an accumulated deficit equal to $158,441,594 as of September 30, 2016. This factor raises
doubt regarding the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern
is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary debt and
equity financings, and the ability of the Company to improve operating margins. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE
3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Presentation
of Interim Information   

The
financial information at September 30, 2016 is unaudited, but includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
that the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information set forth herein, in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly,
such information does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements.
For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
results for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of results for the year ending December 31,
2016 or any future periods.  

6  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company generally recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee
is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. In instances where the final acceptance of the product is specified
by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. No provisions were established for estimated
product returns and allowances based on the Company s historical experience.  

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments   

All
derivatives have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based on the lattice model calculation. These derivatives, including
embedded derivatives in the Company s warrants and convertible preferred stock which have reset provisions to the exercise
price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price less than the exercise price set forth
in such warrants and convertible preferred stock, are separately valued and accounted for on the Company s balance sheet.
Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily
available, fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring
judgment and estimates.  

Lattice
Valuation Model   

The
Company valued the warrants and the conversion features in its formerly outstanding convertible notes and preferred stock using
a lattice valuation model, with the assistance of a valuation consultant. The lattice model values these instruments based on
a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company uses the model to develop a set of potential scenarios. Probabilities
of each scenario occurring during the remaining term of the instruments are determined based on management's projections and the
expert s calculations. These probabilities are used to create a cash flow projection over the term of the instruments and
determine the probability that the projected cash flow will be achieved. A discounted weighted average cash flow for each scenario
is then calculated and compared to the discounted cash flow of the instruments without the compound embedded derivative in order
to determine a value for the compound embedded derivative.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.  

The
Company has utilized various types of financing to fund its business needs, including convertible debt and convertible preferred
stock with warrants attached. The Company reviews its warrants and any conversion features of securities issued as to whether
they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and, if so, whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting
period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had warrants to purchase common stock outstanding, the fair values of which are classified as
a liability.  

Inputs
used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions
based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of
three levels:  

Level
    one   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   

Level
    two   Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and   

Level
    three   Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and
    reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use   

7  

Determining which category an asset or liability
falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company s
only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with warrants and convertible
preferred stock to purchase common stock. The Company classifies the fair value of these warrants under level three. The fair
value of the derivative liability at September 30, 2016 was $376,890 compared to $742,833 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease
in fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $365,943 compared to an increase of $812,803 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Below is a hierarchy table of the components of the derivative liability: 

Concentrations   

Cash
and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance
provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk.  

Inventory   

Inventory is stated at the lower of
cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. The Company follows standard costing methods for manufactured products. Management
assesses the recoverability and establishes reserves based on the net realizable value of the inventory. 

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation
is calculated on the accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives
of five to ten years are used for machinery and equipment, office equipment and furniture, and automobile. Estimated useful lives
of up to five years are used for computer equipment and related software. Depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements
are computed using the term of the lease.  

Intangible
Assets   

Intangible
assets were carried at the purchased cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization was computed over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets, generally from fifteen to twenty years.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based
on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement
of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use
is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  

8  

Income
Taxes   

The
amount of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable is recognized as of the date of the financial statements, utilizing
currently enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax expenses or benefits are recognized in the financial statements for the changes
in deferred tax liabilities or assets between years.  

Income
(Loss) Per Common Share   

Basic
net income (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders
by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding and, when diluted, potential shares from options and warrants
to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method.  

Cashless
Exercise of Warrants/Options   

The Company has issued warrants to purchase
common stock where the holder is entitled to exercise the warrant via a cashless exercise. The Company accounts for the issuance
of common stock on the cashless exercise of warrants on a net basis. 

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The Company estimates the fair value of share-based
payment awards made to employees, directors and related parties, including stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchases
related to employee stock purchase plans and warrants, on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion
of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. We estimate
the fair value of each share-based award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is highly complex
and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated
lives of the stock-based awards and the estimated volatility of the Company s stock price. The Company recognized pre-tax
compensation expense related to stock compensation awards of $317,955 and $4,534,849 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date
( ASU 2015-14 ). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year.
Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU
2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting
periods with that reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-14 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

On
February 25, 2016, the FASB issued Topic 842, its highly-anticipated leasing standard for both lessees and lessors. Under its
core principle, a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer
than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. GAAP. The amendments are effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. At inception,
a lessee must classify all leases as either finance or operating. The Company intends to adopt Topic 842 upon extension of the
current lease or upon entering into a new lease agreement for alternative facilities. The Company is investigating the effect
of adoption of Topic 842 on its results of operations and financial condition. However, it is not anticipated that adoption of
Topic 842 will have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.

On
July 17, 2015, the Company entered into an equipment purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Fordham Capital
Partners, LLC ( Fordham ) pursuant to which the Company sold all of its right, title and interest in production equipment

borrowings of $200,000 due to Fordham Capital plus accrued interest of $3,112, franchise taxes of $96,542 and a security deposit
of $15,800 related to the equipment lease. The Company recognized a loss on the sale of $574,331. Concurrently with entering into
the Purchase Agreement, on July 17, 2015, the Company entered into an equipment lease agreement (the  Equipment Lease Agreement )
with Fordham pursuant to which the Company leased the production equipment from Fordham on terms that included the following:
a lease term of 24 months, monthly lease payments by the Company of $15,800 and the option (at the election of the Company) to
purchase the equipment on or after July 8, 2016 on the following terms: (i) if the purchase date is between 12- 18 months $425,000;
(ii) if the purchase date is between 19- 23 months: $360,000; and (iii) if the purchase date is during the 24th month (but no
later than July 8, 2017): $325,000. The Equipment Lease Agreement includes customary events of default, including non- payment
by the Company of the monthly lease payments and the payment of penalties upon such late payments. The equipment lease is secured
by all of the assets of the Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $172,911 from the Purchase Agreement after paying off
the obligations described above. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

 SUMMARY OF WARRANTS   

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company
and its landlord executed an amendment to the current lease extending the lease until July 14, 2015. Commencing on May 1, 2015,
the parties agreed to a monthly base rent of $10,681 plus property taxes. The Company also agreed to pay $71,125 in rental arrears
on April 30, 2015 and another $71,125 in rental arrears on July 1, 2015. Finally, the parties agreed that the Company will deliver
to the landlord 20,025 shares of its Preferred Shares which shares are convertible to common stock at the landlord s option
at .088 per preferred share. Also, the Company issued a five-year warrant to the landlord to purchase 171,454 shares of Common
Stock at $0.64 per share. 

On
January 8, 2015, in conjunction with the sale of units consisting of convertible preferred stock, the  Company ), issued
warrants (the  Initial Warrant ) to acquire 8.56 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of
$0.64 per share. In addition, the Company agreed to issue to each of the investors in the first round of financing an additional
warrant to acquire (the  Additional Warrant  and together with the Initial Warrant, the  Warrants ) to
acquire 3.64 shares of the Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.64 per share. The Additional Warrants issued are exercisable
for an aggregate of 946,400 shares of the Common Stock. The Warrants expire on the fifth anniversary of their issuance, may be
exercised on a cashless basis, are subject to full ratchet price anti-dilution protection and entitled to registration rights
as set forth below.  

Due
to the anti-dilution provisions of some of the outstanding warrants before the January 8, 2015 transaction, the exercise price
on 15,512,057 warrants has been reduced to $0.35 and the number of shares of common stock into which the warrants are now exercisable
has been adjusted such that the warrants are now exercisable into 54,400,204 shares of common stock.  

In
addition to the foregoing, the members of the Company s Board of Directors agreed to receive 826,806 Initial Warrants
and 351,586 Additional Warrants in exchange for previously issued convertible notes (including principal and accrued and unpaid
interest) (the  Notes ) held by the directors or affiliated entities as follows: (i) 71,211 Units, 609,566 Initial

and (v) 4,873 Units, 41,712 Initial Warrants and 17,737 Additional Warrants were issued to CKS Warehouse, an entity in which Mr.
Hershhorn owns a controlling interest, in exchange for an aggregate of $19,491of principal and interest on notes.

to acquire 8.56 shares of the Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.64 per share all pursuant to separate securities purchase
agreements entered into with each investor. In addition, the Company issued to each of the investors in the first and second rounds
of financing an additional warrant for each Unit acquired (the  Additional Warrant  and together with the Initial
Warrant, the  Warrants ) to acquire 3.64 shares of the Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.64 per share. The Initial
Warrants issued in the second closing are exercisable for 1,070,000 shares of the Common Stock and the Additional Warrants issued
in the second closing are exercisable for an aggregate of 455,000 shares of the Common Stock. The sale was part of a private placement
offering (the  Offering ) in which the Company offered for sale a maximum of 5,000,000 units (gross proceeds of $20,000,000).

Warrants to acquire 2,225,600 shares of common stock and Additional Warrants to acquire 946,400 shares of common stock. The Warrants
expire on the fifth anniversary of their issuance, may be exercised on a cashless basis, are subject to full ratchet price anti-dilution
protection and entitled to registration rights.  

The fair values for the Company s
derivative liabilities related to the Warrants issued is $67,108. The derivative instruments were valued as of September 30, 2016
with the following assumptions: 

-  
      The
    Holder would automatically exercise the warrants at a stock price above the exercise price, with the target exercise price
    dropping as expiration approaches,   

-  
      The
    projected annual volatility was based on the Company s historical volatility,   

-  
      An
    event of default would occur 5% of the time, increasing by 0.10% per month,   

-  
      Dilutive/Full
    Reset events projected to occur based on future projected capital needs (capital funds raised were projected in prior quarters
      future financings are projected going forward in 2016) resulting in the weighted conversion price dropping from the
    initial conversion price.

stock at $0.35 per share. The warrant vested 500,000 shares upon the mutual execution of this agreement, and 250,000 shares each
at the three month, six month, and nine month anniversaries of this agreement. The fair value of the warrants issued is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The assumptions used in the model included the historical volatility
of the Company s stock of 84.52%, and the risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the warrant based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect of 1.07%. For the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recognized compensation
expense of $128,880. The Company also agreed to accrue $5,000 per month which becomes payable to Jeffery Consulting once the Company
has raised $3 million in additional capital. The Company terminated the Consulting Agreement as of April 1, 2016.

Lease   

The
Company leases a combined research and development and office facility located in Mundelein, Illinois. The facility is approximately
44,000 square feet.   

On
March 14, 2014, the Company extended the lease until May 2015 and the required monthly rental payments increased to $21,361, inclusive
of property taxes. Insurance and maintenance are billed when due.   

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company
and its landlord executed an amendment to the lease extending the lease until July 14, 2015. Commencing on May 1, 2015, the parties
agreed to a monthly base rent of $10,681 plus property taxes. The Company also agreed to pay $71,125 in rental arrears on April
30, 2015 and another $71,125 in rental arrears on July 1, 2015. Finally, the Company delivered to the landlord 20,025 shares of
its 12.5% convertible preferred stock which shares are convertible to common stock at the landlord s option at .088 per preferred
share. Also, the Company issued a five-year warrant to the landlord to purchase 171,454 shares of common stock at $0.64 per share.

17   PENDING LITIGATION/CONTINGENT LIABILITY    

On

complaint by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and the plaintiffs are seeking damages
in excess of $200,000. The trial court has issued a default order against the Company, and has denied the Company s Motion

that the underlying allegations are frivolous and wholly without merit and will vigorously defends the claim. The outcome of this
matter is unknown as of the report date. However, the Company has accrued a liability in the amount of $102,000 in respect to

NOTE
19   GUARANTEES    

The
Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require the Company to indemnify parties against
third party claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary
indemnifications to purchasers of the Company s businesses or assets; (ii) certain real estate leases, under which the Company
may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising from the Company s
use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with the Company's officers, directors and employees, under which
the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship. The terms
of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types
of agreements often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically,
the Company has not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for
these obligations on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  

In
general, the Company offers a one-year warranty for most of the products it sells. To date, the Company has not incurred any material
costs associated with these warranties.

The
following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Agritech Worldwide,
Inc. You should read the following discussion along with our financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-Q.  

Unless
the context requires otherwise, in this report, the  Company,   Agritech,   Agritech Worldwide, 
 we,   us  and  our  refer to Agritech Worldwide, Inc.  

Overview   

Agritech
Worldwide, Inc. (formerly Z Trim Holdings, Inc.) is an agricultural technology company that owns existing, and seeks to develop
new, products and processes that convert generally available agricultural by-products into multi-functional all-natural ingredients
that can be used in food manufacturing and other industries. Our primary focus and the source of substantially all of our revenue
is from the sale of our all-natural products, Z Trim , to the food industry. We currently sell a line of all-natural products
to the food industry designed to help manufacturers reduce their costs, improve the quality of finished goods, and solve many
production problems. Our innovative technology can provide value-added all-natural ingredients across virtually all food industry
categories. These products offer a range of functional attributes, including helping to reduce fat and calories, adding fiber,
improving shelf-stability, preventing oil migration, and enhancing binding capacity   all without degrading the taste and
texture of the final food products. Perhaps most significantly, our ingredients can help extend the life of finished products,
potentially increasing our customers  gross margins.  

We
have developed products that manage moisture to help reduce production costs and improve nutritional value in finished foods,
while maintaining the essential taste and mouth-feel associated with full-fat products. The potential global market for our line
of products spans the entire food and nutritional beverage industry, including fat-free, low-fat, reduced-fat and full-fat, across
meats, baked goods, dairy and non-dairy products, snacks, beverages, dressings, sauces and dips.  

In
July 2012, we opened an industrial products division focusing on the manufacture, marketing and sales of products designed specifically
for industrial applications, including oil drilling fluids, petroleum coke, charcoal briquettes, hydraulic fracturing, and paper
and wood adhesives. When used in industrial operations, we believe that our products can reduce costs, enhance supply-chain reliability,
limit environmental impact, and improve finished product quality compared to current products such as guar gum, xanthan gum, CMC,
lignosulfonates and starches used as binders, adhesives, viscofiers or emulsifiers.  

Going
Concern   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we incurred a net loss of $2,011,964 and had an accumulated deficit of $158,441,594. We incurred a net loss of $23,976,431 for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and had an accumulated deficit of $156,429,630. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash
and cash equivalents in the amount of $116,408 and total liabilities of $6,455,968. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash
equivalents in the amount of $309,851 and total liabilities in the amount of $4,918,652. We also had a working capital deficit
of $6,047,937 and $3,801,651 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Over the last several years, our operations
have been funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities. However, we still require additional financing
to fully implement our business plan for the next twelve months and beyond. As of the date of this quarterly report, we had not
generated sufficient revenues to meet our cash flow needs. As of November 14, 2016, our current cash on hand is not sufficient
for us to be able to maintain our operations at the current level through December 31, 2016 and not enough to fund our operations
for the next 12 months. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Although we
have generated revenue, we are still operating at a net loss, and may continue to incur losses for a period of time. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds from our operating or financing activities to support our continued
operations past December 31, 2016. If we cannot continue as a going concern, we will need to substantially revise our business
plan or cease operations, which will reduce or completely eliminate the value of your investment.

Reincorporation   

We were originally incorporated in the
State of Illinois on May 5, 1994 under the name Circle Group Entertainment Ltd. On June 21, 2006, we filed a certificate of amendment
to our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Z Trim Holdings Inc. On March 23, 2016, we changed our state of incorporation
by engaging in a merger (the  Reincorporation ) with and into our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Agritech Worldwide,
Inc., a Nevada corporation, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into by Z Trim and
Agritech on March 18, 2016 (the  Merger Agreement ). The Reincorporation was consummated on March 23, 2016 and was
effectuated by the filing of (i) articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, and (ii) articles of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. The Reincorporation effected a change in our legal domicile from Illinois
to Nevada. Upon the effectiveness of the Reincorporation our affairs ceased to be governed by (i) Illinois corporation laws, (ii)
our Illinois Articles of Incorporation, and (iii) our Illinois Bylaws, and our affairs became subject to (a) Nevada corporation
laws, (b) Agritech s Articles of Incorporation of and (c) Agritech s Bylaws. The resulting Nevada corporation is (i)
be deemed to be the same entity as the Illinois corporation for all purposes under the laws of Nevada, (ii) continue to have all
of the rights, privileges and powers of the Illinois corporation, (iii) continue to possess all properties of the Illinois corporation,
and (iv) continues to have all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Illinois corporation. 

Current
Trends and Recent Developments Affecting the Company   

Sales
and Manufacturing    

Revenues for the third quarter of 2016
increased approximately 70% as compared to revenues for the third quarter of 2015 due to increased demand for our product and catch-up
orders from customers who did not order product in the second quarter due to a price increase. This price increase was implemented
after a review of production costs and product benefits and functionality. The determination by management was that our products
and price points were not commensurate with our benefits and value propositions available to the Company s customers. In
its history, the Company had experimented with outside toll manufacturing arrangements. These efforts were not successful. This
year, the Company returned its focus to its facility in Mundelein, IL as its primary manufacturing facility. This return resulted
in greater production control but with the result of experiencing very limited manufacturing output. In the second quarter, meaningful
capacity increases were achieved yielding approximately 30% greater production. Gross margins, while still at a loss improved 67%.
The comprehensive process engineering and structural review of company operations and its current manufacturing facility commenced
last quarter is continuing. An outside process and structural engineering firm has been hired to help the Company develop a path
forward to find significantly more capacity at our Mundelein, IL facility. With greater product availability management expects
current customers will order greater quantities and our new customer acquisition efforts will be supported as well. 

Funding
Initiatives    

On
January 8, 2015, the Company entered into agreements to sell an aggregate of 260,000 units to eight (8) accredited investors at
a price per unit of $4.00 (the  Units ) with each Unit consisting of (i) one (1) share of 12.5% Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Stock (the  Preferred Shares ) and (ii) one (1) warrant (the  Initial Warrant ), representing
the right to acquire 8.56 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.64 per share, for aggregate cash proceeds of $1,040,000
pursuant to separate purchase agreements entered into with each investor (the  Securities Purchase Agreements ). On
February 9, 2015, we closed a second round of our private placement offering with four (4) accredited investors in which we raised
gross proceeds of $500,000 and sold 125,000 Units. In addition, we issued to each of the investors in the first and second round
of financing an additional warrant for each Unit acquired (the  Additional Warrant  and together with the Initial
Warrant, the  Warrants ) to acquire 3.64 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.64 per share. The Additional
Warrants issued in the initial closing of 260,000 Units are exercisable for an aggregate of 946,400 shares of our common stock.
The Initial Warrants issued in the second closing are exercisable for 1,070,000 shares of our common stock and the Additional
Warrants issued in the second closing are exercisable for an aggregate of 455,000 shares of our common stock. The Warrants expire
on the fifth anniversary of their issuance, may be exercised on a cashless basis, are subject to full ratchet price anti-dilution
protection and entitled to registration rights as set forth below. Subsequent to February 9, 2015, we sold an additional 187,500
units, each unit consists of (i) one Preferred Share and (ii) one (1) warrant to acquire 8.56 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $0.64 per share for aggregate cash proceeds of $750,000.  

We
used the net proceeds of the above-described offering (the  Offering ) for working capital and general corporate purposes,
including without limitation, to repay certain loans. The Offering is part of a private placement offering in which the Company
offered for sale on a  best efforts all or none  basis up to 250,000 units (gross proceeds of $1,000,000, including
the principal amount of bridge notes exchanged for Units, and on a  best efforts  basis the remaining 4,750,000 Units
for a maximum of 5,000,000 Units (gross proceeds of $20,000,000).  

As of January 8 th , 2015,
due to the anti-dilution provisions of some of the outstanding warrants, the exercise price on 15,512,057 warrants was reduced
to $0.35 and the number of shares of common stock into which the warrants were then exercisable was adjusted such that the warrants
became exercisable into 50,957,780 shares of common stock. 

30  

In
addition to the foregoing, the members of our Board of Directors agreed to receive an aggregate of 96,589 Units (representing
one (1) Unit for every $4.00 of debt exchanged), 826,806 Initial Warrants and 351,586 Additional Warrants in exchange for previously
issued convertible notes (including principal and accrued and unpaid interest) (the  Notes ) held by the directors
or affiliated entities as follows: (i) 71,211 Units, 609,566 Initial Warrants and 259,208 Additional Warrants were issued to Edward
B. Smith III, our Chief Executive Officer, in exchange for an aggregate of $284,844 of notes and accrued interest, (ii) 10,084
Units, 86,317 Initial Warrants and 36,705 Additional Warrants were issued to Morris Garfinkle in exchange for $40,335 of notes
and accrued interest; (iii) 5,211 Units, 44,606 Initial Warrants and 18,968 Additional Warrants were issued to each of Mark Hershhorn
and Brian Israel in exchange for an aggregate of $20,844 of notes and accrued interest, respectively; and (v) 4,873 Units, 41,712
Initial Warrants and 17,737 Additional Warrants were issued to CKS Warehouse, an entity in which Mr. Hershhorn owns a controlling
interest, in exchange for an aggregate of $19,491 of principal and interest on notes and accrued interest.  

After
the Reincorporation, each outstanding Preferred Share continued to be an outstanding share of the Nevada corporation s preferred
stock. The following is a summary of material provisions of the Preferred Shares as set forth in the Certificate of Designations:  

The
Preferred Shares are nonvoting, accrue dividends at the rate per annum equal to 12.5% of the sum of (i) the Stated Value (which
initially is $4.00) until the Maturity Date as defined in the Statement of Resolution Establishing Preferred Shares and (ii) the
amount of accrued and unpaid dividends payable, are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of the holder as described
in the Statement of Resolution Establishing Preferred Shares, have anti- dilution protection, registration rights, may be redeemed
under certain circumstances, liquidation preference, protective provisions and board rights under certain circumstances.  

Results
of Operations    

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues    

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $371,085, as compared to revenue of $218,732 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of 70%. Our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was entirely attributable to
product sales. We attribute the increase in sales in the current year s period to increased demand and catch-up orders
from customers that initially balked at a product price increase initiated in the second quarter. Our ability to generate increased
revenue in future reporting periods will be dependent on continued increased demand for our products from existing and new customers,
and the completion of changes in our production process to further improve our capacity and reduce costs, all of which cannot
be assured.  

Cost
of Revenues    

Cost of revenues for products sold for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $509,767 and $445,936, respectively, an increase of $63,831 or 14.3%. The increase
in costs of goods sold in the current year s period was attributable to increased production. However, margins improved
by 67% as cost of revenues to revenues as a percentage decreased from 204% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 137%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. We believe that increases in sales and monthly production volume will enable us
to allocate our fixed costs over a greater number of finished goods and reduce the cost of goods sold in the future to improve
margins.  

31  

Gross
Margin (Loss)    

Gross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $138,682 compared to a gross loss of $227,204, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross loss reflects
a number of factors that can vary from period to period, including those described above. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses    

Operating expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $529,287 a decrease of $243,670 over the comparable period ended September 30, 2015 of $772,957.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation, salary expenses and consulting fees. 

The
components of selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively are
as follows:  

The decrease in salary and employee
benefits to $99,947 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $271,710 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is
attributable to fewer employees. Stock based compensation decreased by $199,603 in 2016 as compared to 2015. Consultant fees increased
by $29,125. 

Operating Loss   

The operating loss for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased to $667,969 compared to a loss of $1,000,161 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to
the reasons described above. 

Other Income (Expenses)    

Other expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $28,032 as compared to other expense of $565,031 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The change was primarily
due to the large expense, in 2015, related to the loss on sale and leaseback transaction. Interest expense in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $155,889 compared to $57,261 for the prior year. 

Net Loss   

As a result of the above, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $696,001 as compared to a net loss of $1,562,192 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. 

32  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Share    

The
basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.01 as compared to the basic and diluted
net loss per share of $0.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The per share results were impacted by the decrease
in the Operating Loss and Other Expenses as discussed above and the significant increase in the average number of shares outstanding
in 2016 compared to 2015.  

Nine
months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues    

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $923,513, as compared to revenue of $834,563 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of 11%. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was entirely attributable to product
sales. We attribute the increase in sales in the current year s period due to increased customer demand. Our ability
to generate increased revenue in future reporting periods will be dependent on continued increased demand for our products from
existing and new customers, and the completion of changes in our production process to further improve our capacity and reduce
costs, all of which cannot be assured.  

Cost of Revenues   

Cost of revenues for products sold for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,295,444 and $1,420,476, respectively, a decrease of $125,032 or 9%. The decrease
in costs of goods sold in the current year s period was attributable to improved production efficiency. Margins improved
by 30% as cost of revenues to revenues as a percentage decreased from 170% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 140%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We believe that increases in sales and monthly production volume will enable us to
allocate our fixed costs over a greater number of finished goods and reduce the cost of goods sold in the future to improve margins.  

Gross Margin (Loss)   

Gross loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $371,931, compared to a gross loss of $585,913 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross loss reflects a
number of factors that can vary from period to period, including those described above. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

Operating expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $1,657,371 a decrease of $5,224,057 over the comparable period ended September 30, 2015 of $6,881,428.
The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation and to a lesser extent a decrease in salary expense and
consulting fees. 

The components of selling, general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively are as follows: 

The decrease in salary and employee
benefits to $372,424 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $863,175 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is
attributable to fewer employees. Stock based compensation decreased by $4,079,344 in 2016 as compared to 2015. All other expenses
in total decreased by $653,962, as a result of lower consultant fees and directors  fees. 

33  

Operating
Loss    

The operating loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased to $2,029,302 compared to a loss of $7,467,341 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to
the reasons described above. 

Other
Income (Expenses)    

Other
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $17,388 as compared to other expense of $15,409,236 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The change was primarily due to the large expense, in 2015, related to the loss on warrant exchanges.
Interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $371,062 compared to $154,200 for the prior year.  

Net
Loss    

As a result of the above, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of 2,011,964 as compared to a net loss of $22,876,577 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Share    

The
basic and diluted net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.02 as compared to the basic and diluted
net loss per share of $0.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The per share results were impacted by the decrease
in the Operating Loss and Other Expenses as discussed above and the significant increase in the average number of shares outstanding
in 2016 compared to 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016, we had a cash and
cash equivalents balance of $116,408, a decrease from a balance of $309,851 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had
working capital deficit of $6,047,937 as compared to working capital deficit of $3,801,651 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease
in working capital primarily resulted from the decreases in cash, and increased short-term borrowings. Subsequent to September
30, 2016 we raised an aggregate $100,000 from debt financing. As of November 10, 2016, we had a cash balance of $22,982. 

Over the last several years, our operations
have been funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities. We continue to explore additional equity and debt
funding however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising all of the additional funding that it is seeking
or that such amount will be sufficient for our needs. As of the date of our most recent audit, for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, we had not generated sufficient revenues to meet our cash flow needs. Our current cash on hand as of November 10, 2016
is insufficient for us to be able to maintain our operations at the current level beyond December 31, 2016. As a result, there
is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Although we have generated revenue, we are still operating at a net
loss, and may continue to incur losses for a period of time. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds
from our operating or financing activities to support our continued operations past December 31, 2016. If we cannot continue as
a going concern, we will need to substantially revise our business plan or cease operations, which will reduce or completely eliminate
the value of our security holders  investment. 

Certain of our Preferred Shares and warrants
have reset provisions to the exercise price and conversion price if the Company issues equity or other derivatives at a price
less than the exercise price set forth in such preferred stock and warrants. These reset provisions result in a derivative liability
in our financial statements. Our derivative liabilities decreased to $376,890 at September 30, 2016 from $742,833 at December
31, 2015. Fair values for exchange traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are
not readily available, fair values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data
and requiring judgment and estimates.

The following discussion focuses on information
in more detail on the main elements of the $193,443 net decrease in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included
in the accompanying Statements of Cash Flows. The table below sets forth a summary of the sources and uses of cash for the nine
month periods ended September 30: 

Cash used in operating activities was $1,916,818
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,794,846 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.
Net losses of $2,011,964 and $22,876,577 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were the primary
reasons for our negative operating cash flow in both periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 our negative
operating cash flow was significantly offset by the effects of non-cash charges to income including stock-based compensation,
shares issued for directors  fees and depreciation. 

No
cash was provided by or used in investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. Cash provided by investing
activities was $172,911 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 due to the sale leaseback transaction.  

Cash
provided by financing activities was $1,723,376 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to $878,789 during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Over the last several years, our operations have been funded primarily through
the sale of both equity and debt securities and the cash conversion of warrants into equity. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we raised $1,800,000 from the issuance of short term non-convertible notes and paid down $76,624 in capital lease obligations
resulting in cash provided by financing activities of $1,723,376. During the first nine months of 2015, we raised $880,000 from
the sale of Units consisting of Preferred Shares and warrants and $587,000 from the sale of short-term non-convertible notes mostly
offset by the payoff of short term borrowings from Fordham Capital. On March 24, 2015, we made a final payment of principal
and interest in the amount of $570,449 to Fordham Capital Partners in satisfaction of the Amended and Restated Equipment Revolving
Note dated July 16, 2014.  

Commitments/Contingencies:   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding non-convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,257,000 due to related
parties that mature within one year.  

We
also have non-convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,750,000 payable to unrelated parties that mature within
one year.  

In
addition, we have outstanding convertible notes payable to related parties in the principal amount of $624,866 at September 30,
2016.  

The
amount of accrued and unpaid interest was $500,533 on the same date.  

Capital
Expenditures . At September 30, 2016, we have no material commitments for capital expenditures.  

Lease
commitments . We lease a combined manufacturing, research and development and office facility located in Mundelein, Illinois.
The lease is on a month to month basis. Monthly rental payments are $17,972, inclusive of property taxes. We believe we will be
successful in negotiating a new lease with the landlord.  

On
July 17, 2015, the Company entered into an equipment lease agreement (the  Equipment Lease Agreement ) with Fordham
pursuant to which the Company leased the production equipment from Fordham on terms that included the following: a lease term
of 24 months, monthly lease payments by the Company of $15,800 and the option (at the election of the Company) to purchase the
equipment on or after July 8, 2016 on the following terms: (i) if the purchase date is between 12- 18 months $425,000; (ii) if
the purchase date is between 19- 23 months: $360,000; and (iii) if the purchase date is during the 24th month (but no later than
July 8, 2017): $325,000. The Equipment Lease Agreement includes customary events of default, including non- payment by the Company
of the monthly lease payments and the payment of penalties upon such late payments. The equipment lease is secured by all of the
assets of the Company.  

Litigation .
In July 2007, we and Greg Halpern, its former Chief Executive Officer in his individual capacity, were sued in the 20th Judicial
Circuit Court, St. Clair County, Illinois by Joseph Sanfilippo and James Cluck for violation of the Consumer Fraud Act and damages
in excess of $200,000. The trial court has issued a default order against us, and has denied our motion to reconsider. Management
believes that the trial court s rulings were erroneous and that it has grounds for appeal, and that the underlying allegations
are frivolous and wholly without merit and the Company will vigorously defend the claim. The outcome of this matter is unknown
as of the date of this report. However, the Company has allocated a reserve of $102,000 to satisfy any liability it may incur
as a result of this matter.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Our
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. For a full discussion of our accounting policies as required
by GAAP, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We consider certain accounting policies
to be critical to an understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements because their application requires significant
judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain. The specific risks related to these critical accounting
policies are unchanged at the date of this report and are described in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks    

Not

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .  

The
Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as the Company s
interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms and (2) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion is based primarily on the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, where
management identified material weaknesses consisting of ineffective controls over (i) the control environment, (ii) financial
statement disclosure; and (iii) financial reporting, and our failure to complete the process of remediating these weaknesses by
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to develop internal
processes and segregations to mitigate the internal control deficiencies but that is still a work in process. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls   

Our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will
prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute
assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented
if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.  

Furthermore,
smaller reporting companies face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it difficult
to properly segregate duties. Often, one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company s operation and are in a
position to override any system of internal control. Additionally, smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting
software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.  

36  

Remediation
of Material Weaknesses   

As discussed above, as of December 31,
2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting primarily due to us not having developed
accounting policies and procedures and effectively communicating the same to our employees. Management plans to address these weaknesses
by looking to hire a part time accountant for monthly or quarterly work and providing future investments in the continuing education
of our accounting and financial professionals. 

If
the remedial measures described above are insufficient to address any of the identified material weaknesses or are not implemented
effectively, or if additional deficiencies arise in the future, material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements
may occur in the future. Among other things, any unremediated material weaknesses could result in material post-closing adjustments
in future financial statements.

       Legal
    Proceedings    

None.  

Item 1A.   
       Risk
    Factors    

The
following information and updates should be read in conjunction with the information disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A,
 Risk Factors,  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015
Annual Report ). Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors and uncertainties
disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report.  

We
have a history of operating losses and cannot guarantee profitable operations in the future. Failure on our part to achieve profitability
may cause us to reduce or eventually cease operations.    

We incurred a net loss of $2,011,964 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, and had an accumulated deficit of $158,441,594. We incurred a net loss of $23,976,431 for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and had an accumulated deficit of $156,429,630.  

If
we continue to incur significant losses, we may not be able to continue operations. Even if we can continue operations, our cash
reserves may be depleted earlier than currently anticipated, and we may be required to limit its future growth objectives to levels
corresponding with its then available cash reserves.  

If
we do not obtain additional financing, we will be required to discontinue operations.    

As September 30, 2016, we had cash in
the amount of $116,408 and total liabilities in the amount of $6,455,968. We also had a working capital deficit of $6,047,937 as
of September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash in the amount of $309,851 and total liabilities in the amount of $4,918,652.
We also had a working capital deficit of $3,801,651 as of December 31, 2015. Over the last several years, our operations have been
funded primarily through the sale of both equity and debt securities. However, we still require additional financing to fully implement
our business plan for the next twelve months and beyond. Our current cash on hand is insufficient for us to be able to maintain
its operations at the current level through December 31, 2016. In order to continue to pursue our business plan, we will require
additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be delayed and
its ability to maintain or expand operations will be impaired. We intend to secure additional funding through debt or equity financing
arrangements, increased sales generated by operations and reduced expenses. 

Our
ability to repay our loans is predicated on future sales growth and generating positive cash flow from the business or securing
other financing.    

As of September 30, 2016, we had total
liabilities of $6,455,968, which includes $3,594,300 of short term notes. As of December 31, 2015, we had total liabilities of
$4,918,652, which includes $1,831,866 of short term notes. The amount of revenues generated by the business has been insufficient
to support ongoing daily operations. Previously, we had to rely on new equity or debt financing in order to satisfy other financings
incurred by us. Our current cash balance as of November 14, 2016 of $22,982 will not be sufficient to repay the loans and support
our continuing operations as planned. There are no assurances that we will secure additional debt or equity financing in order
to pay off the loans and support our continuing operations as planned.

Item
    2.   
       Unregistered
    Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

Company issued a 14% senior unsecured note to an accredited investor in the principal amount of $500,000. The note matures in one
year (July 14, 2017) and bears interest at 14% compounded based on a 365-day year. Accrued interest is payable at maturity in cash.
In addition, the Company issued a warrant to acquire 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, at an exercise price
of $0.64 per share to the accredited investor. The Warrants expire on the fifth anniversary of their issuance, may be exercised
on a cashless basis, are subject to full ratchet price anti- dilution protection and entitled to registration rights.

2017) and bears interest at 14% compounded based on a 365-day year. Accrued interest is payable at maturity in cash. In addition,
the Company issued a warrant to acquire 600,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value, $0.00005 per share, at an
exercise price of $0.64 per share to the accredited investor. The Warrants expire on the fifth anniversary of their issuance, may

On November 4th, 2016, the Company issued
a 14% senior unsecured note to an accredited investor in the principal amount of $100,000. The note matures in one year (November
4th, 2017) and bears interest at 14% compounded based on a 365-day year. Accrued interest is payable at maturity in cash. In addition,

exercise price of $0.64 per share to the accredited investor. The Warrants expire on the fifth anniversary of their issuance, may
be exercised on a cashless basis, are subject to full ratchet price anti- dilution protection and entitled to registration rights. 

None of the issuances of the securities
described above were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), or the securities
laws of any state, and were offered and sold in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a) (2) under
the Securities Act and corresponding provisions of state securities laws, which exempt transactions by an issuer not involving
any public offering. The investors represented their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view
towards distribution. The investors were given adequate information about us to make an informed investment decision. We did not
engage in any general solicitation or advertising.
