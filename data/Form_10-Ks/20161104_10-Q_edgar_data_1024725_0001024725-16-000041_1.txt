CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE  SAFE HARBOR  PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

  FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
   
  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tenneco Inc.: 
  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Tenneco Inc. and its subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and changes in shareholders' equity for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders  equity for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 24, 2016 (which included an explanatory paragraph with respect to the Company s change in the manner of accounting in which it classifies deferred taxes in 2015), we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the condensed consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

    Consolidation and Presentation 
     As you read the accompanying financial statements you should also read our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly Tenneco Inc. s results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position, cash flows, and changes in shareholders  equity for the periods indicated. We have prepared the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for annual financial statements. 
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. We carry investments in   20 percent   to   50 percent   owned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, as equity method investments, at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative translation adjustments. We have eliminated all intercompany transactions.  
  Prepayments and Other 
  Prepayments and other included   $134 million   and   $107 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for in-process tools and dies that we are building for our original equipment customers. 
  Accounts Payable 
  Accounts payable included   $108 million   and   $93 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for accrued compensation and   $20 million   and   $17 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for bank overdrafts at our European subsidiaries.  
   
           (2) 
    Financial Instruments 
     The net carrying and estimated fair values of our financial instruments by class at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Asset and Liability Instruments     The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term receivables, accounts payable, and short-term debt was considered to be the same as or was not determined to be materially different from the carrying amount. 
  Long-term Debt     The fair value of our public fixed rate senior notes is based on quoted market prices (level 1). The fair value of our private borrowings under our senior credit facility and other long-term debt instruments is based on the market value of debt with similar maturities, interest rates and risk characteristics (level 2). The fair value of our level 1 debt, as classified in the fair value hierarchy, was   $744 million   and   $748 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We have classified   $584 million   and   $390 million   as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, since we utilize valuation inputs that are observable both directly and indirectly. We classified the remaining   $16 million   and   $22 million  , consisting of foreign subsidiary debt, as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  
  TENNECO INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The fair value hierarchy definition prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following levels: 
                   Level 1 
      
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 
      
    Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 
      
    Unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions. 

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts     When foreign currency exchange rate risk cannot be managed by operational strategies, we use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts with terms of less than   one year  , to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans and accounts receivable and payable in nonfunctional currencies made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Additionally, we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. We manage counter-party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is based on an internally developed model which incorporates observable inputs including quoted spot rates, forward exchange rates and discounted future expected cash flows utilizing market interest rates with similar quality and maturity characteristics. We record the change in fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts as part of currency gains (losses) within cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of income. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded in prepayments and other current assets or other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts was a net asset position of   $1 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .    
  The following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of   September 30, 2016   (all of which mature in 2016): 

Guarantees    We have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries, and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt. All of our existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our senior credit facility and our senior notes on a joint and several basis. The arrangement for the senior credit facility is also secured by first-priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to   66 percent   of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. No assets or capital stock secure our senior notes. For additional information, refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc., where we present the Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements. 
  We have   two   performance guarantee agreements in the U.K. between Tenneco Management (Europe) Limited ( TMEL ) and the   two   Walker Group Retirement Plans, the Walker Group Employee Benefit Plan and the Walker Group Executive Retirement Benefit Plan (the  Walker Plans ), whereby TMEL will guarantee the payment of all current and future pension contributions in the event of a payment default by the sponsoring or participating employers of the Walker Plans. The Walker Plans are comprised of employees from Tenneco Walker (U.K.) Limited and our Futaba-Tenneco U.K. joint venture. Employer

contributions are funded by both Tenneco Walker (U.K.) Limited, as the sponsoring employer and Futaba-Tenneco U.K., as a participating employer. The performance guarantee agreements are expected to remain in effect until all pension obligations for the Walker Plans  sponsoring and participating employers have been satisfied. The maximum amount payable for these pension performance guarantees that is not attributable to Tenneco is approximately   $10 million   as of   September 30, 2016   which is determined by taking   105 percent   of the liability of the Walker Plans calculated under section 179 of the U.K. Pension Act of 2004 offset by plan assets multiplied by the ownership percent attributable to Futaba-Tenneco U.K. We did not record an additional liability for this performance guarantee since Tenneco Walker (U.K.) Limited, as the sponsoring employer of the Walker Plans, already recognizes   100 percent   of the pension obligation calculated based on U.S. GAAP, for all of the Walker Plans  participating employers on its balance sheet, which was   $7 million   and   $11 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , all pension contributions under the Walker Plans were current for all of the Walker Plans  sponsoring and participating employers. 
  In June 2011, we entered into an indemnity agreement between TMEL and Futaba Industrial Co. Ltd. which requires Futaba to indemnify TMEL for any cost, loss or liability which TMEL may incur under the performance guarantee agreements relating to the Futaba-Tenneco U.K. joint venture. The maximum amount reimbursable by Futaba to TMEL under this indemnity agreement is equal to the amount incurred by TMEL under the performance guarantee agreements multiplied by Futaba s shareholder ownership percentage of the Futaba-Tenneco U.K. joint venture. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amount reimbursable by Futaba to TMEL is approximately   $10 million  . 
  We have issued guarantees through letters of credit in connection with some obligations of our affiliates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have guaranteed   $32 million   in letters of credit to support some of our subsidiaries  insurance arrangements, foreign employee benefit programs, environmental remediation activities and cash management and capital requirements. 
  Financial Instruments     One of our European subsidiaries receives payment from one of its customers whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the delivery of negotiable financial instruments. We may collect these financial instruments before their maturity date by either selling them at a discount or using them to satisfy accounts receivable that have previously been sold to a European bank. Any of these financial instruments which are not sold are classified as other current assets. Such financial instruments held by our European subsidiary totaled   zero   and less than   $1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  In certain instances, several of our Chinese subsidiaries receive payments from customers through the receipt of financial instruments on the date the customer payments are due. Several of our Chinese subsidiaries also satisfy vendor payments through the delivery of financial instruments on the date the payments are due. Financial instruments issued to satisfy vendor payables and not redeemed totaled   $22 million   and   $15 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and were classified as notes payable. Financial instruments received from OE customers and not redeemed totaled   $14 million   and   $8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We classify financial instruments received from our customers as other current assets if issued by a financial institution of our customers or as customer notes and accounts, net if issued by our customer. We classified   $14 million   and   $8 million   in other current assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The financial instruments received by one of our European subsidiaries and some of our Chinese subsidiaries are drafts drawn that are payable at a future date and, in some cases, are negotiable and/or are guaranteed by the banks of the customers. The use of these instruments for payment follows local commercial practice. Because certain of such financial instruments are guaranteed by our customers  banks, we believe they represent a lower financial risk than the outstanding accounts receivable that they satisfy which are not guaranteed by a bank. 
  Supply Chain Financing     Certain of our suppliers in the U.S. participate in a supply chain financing program under which they securitize their accounts receivables from Tenneco. The financial institution that participates in the supply chain financing program does so on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from Tenneco's suppliers at any time. If the financial institution did not continue to purchase receivables from Tenneco's suppliers under this program, the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with Tenneco which in turn would cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase. 
  Restricted Cash -   Some of our Chinese subsidiaries that issue their own financial instruments to pay vendors are required to maintain a cash balance if they exceed credit limits with the financial institution that guarantees the financial instruments.     A restricted cash balance was required at those Chinese subsidiaries for   $2 million   and   $1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

    Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements 
     Our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The arrangement is secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to   66 percent   of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, as well as guarantees by our material domestic subsidiaries.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the senior credit facility provides us with a total revolving credit facility size of   $1,200 million   and had a   $274 million   balance outstanding under the Tranche A Term Facility, both of which will mature on   December 8, 2019  . Net carrying amount for the balance outstanding under the Tranche A Term Facility including a   $2 million   debt issuance cost was   $272 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Funds may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed under the revolving credit facility without premium or penalty (subject to any customary LIBOR breakage fees). The revolving credit facility is reflected as debt on our balance sheet only if we borrow money under this facility or if we use the facility to make payments for letters of credit. Outstanding letters of credit reduce our availability to borrow revolving loans under the facility. We are required to make quarterly principal payments under the Tranche A Term Facility of   $3.75 million   through   December 31, 2016  ,   $5.625 million   beginning March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017,   $7.5 million   beginning March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2019 and a final payment of   $195 million   is due on December 8, 2019. We have excluded the required payments, within the next twelve months, under the Tranche A Term Facility totaling   $21 million   from current liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  , because we have the intent and ability to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis by using our revolving credit facility. 
  The financial ratios required under the amended and restated senior credit facility, and the actual ratios we achieved for the three quarters of 2016, are as follows: 

The senior credit facility includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of   3.50   and a minimum interest coverage ratio of   2.75  , in each case through December 8, 2019. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , of the   $1,200 million   available under the revolving credit facility, we had unused borrowing capacity of   $891 million   with   $309 million   in outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding debt also included (i)   $274 million   of a term loan which consisted of a   $272 million   net carrying amount including a   $2 million   debt issuance cost related to our Tranche A Term Facility which is subject to quarterly principal payments as described above through   December 8, 2019  , (ii)   $225 million   of notes which consisted of a   $221 million   net carrying amount including a   $4 million   debt issuance cost related to our 5   3   /   8    percent senior notes due   December 15, 2024  , (iii)   $500 million   of notes which consisted of a   $492 million   net carrying amount including a   $8 million   debt issuance cost related to our 5 percent senior notes due   July 15, 2026   (which were issued on June 13, 2016), and (iv)   $140 million   of other debt. 
  On June 6, 2016, we announced a cash tender offer to purchase our outstanding   $500 million   6   7   /8 percent senior notes due in 2020. We received tenders representing   $325 million   aggregate principal amount of the notes and, on June 13, 2016, we purchased the tendered notes at a price of   103.81   percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On July 13, 2016, we redeemed the remaining outstanding   $175 million   aggregate principal amount of the notes that were not purchased pursuant to the tender offer at a price of   103.438   percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We used the proceeds of the issuance of our 5 percent senior notes due 2026 to fund the purchase and redemption. The senior credit facility was used to fund the fees and expenses of the tender offer and redemption. 
  We recorded   $16 million   and   $8 million   of pre-tax interest charges in June and July of 2016, respectively, related to the repurchase and redemption of our 6   7   /8 percent senior notes due in 2020 and the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs relating to those notes. 
   
           (4) 
    Income Taxes 
     For interim tax reporting we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply it to our year to date ordinary income. Jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recognized due to a valuation allowance are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. The impact of including these jurisdictions on the quarterly effective rate calculation could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter due to the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections. The tax effects of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  
  TENNECO INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which they occur. 
  We reported income tax benefit of   $69 million   and tax expense of   $34 million   in the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2016 included a net tax benefit of   $105 million   primarily relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes. During the third quarter, we completed our detailed analysis of our ability to recognize and utilize foreign tax credits within the carryforward period. As a result, we amended our U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2006 to 2012 to claim foreign tax credits in lieu of deducting foreign taxes paid. The U.S. foreign tax credit law provides for a credit against U.S. taxes otherwise payable for foreign taxes paid with regard to dividends, interest and royalties paid to us in the U.S. The tax expense recorded in the third quarter of 2015 included a net tax benefit of   $12 million   primarily relating to tax adjustments to prior year U.S. research and development tax credits. 
  We reported income tax expense of   $5 million   and   $122 million   in the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  The tax expense recorded in the first nine months of 2016 included a net tax benefit of   $106 million   primarily relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes as described above. The tax expense recorded in the first nine months of 2015 included a net tax benefit of   $9 million   primarily relating to prior year U.S. research and development tax credits, prior year intercompany transactions and tax adjustments to prior year income tax estimates. 
  We believe it is reasonably possible that up to   $22 million   in unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of foreign statute of limitations and the conclusion of income tax examinations may be recognized within the next twelve months. 
   
           (5) 
    Accounts Receivable Securitization 
     We securitize some of our accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis in the U.S. and Europe. As servicer under these accounts receivable securitization programs, we are responsible for performing all accounts receivable administration functions for these securitized financial assets including collections and processing of customer invoice adjustments. In the U.S., we have an accounts receivable securitization program with   three   commercial banks comprised of a first priority facility and a second priority facility. We securitize original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under the bank program. In March 2015, the U.S. program was amended and extended to April 30, 2017. The first priority facility provides financing of up to   $130 million   and the second priority facility, which is subordinated to the first priority facility, provides up to an additional   $50 million   of financing. Both facilities monetize accounts receivable generated in the U.S. that meet certain eligibility requirements, and the second priority facility also monetizes certain accounts receivable generated in the U.S. that would otherwise be ineligible under the first priority securitization facility. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable under the U.S. program was   $50 million   and   $30 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Each facility contains customary covenants for financings of this type, including restrictions related to liens, payments, mergers or consolidations and amendments to the agreements underlying the receivables pool. Further, each facility may be terminated upon the occurrence of customary events (with customary grace periods, if applicable), including breaches of covenants, failure to maintain certain financial ratios, inaccuracies of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain changes in the rate of default or delinquency of the receivables, a change of control and the entry or other enforcement of material judgments. In addition, each facility contains cross-default provisions, where the facility could be terminated in the event of non-payment of other material indebtedness when due and any other event which permits the acceleration of the maturity of material indebtedness. 
  We also securitize receivables in our European operations with regional banks in Europe. The arrangements to securitize receivables in Europe are provided under six separate facilities provided by various financial institutions in each of the foreign jurisdictions. The commitments for these arrangements are generally for   one year  , but some may be canceled with notice   90 days   prior to renewal. In some instances, the arrangement provides for cancellation by the applicable financial institution at any time upon notification. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable in Europe was   $206 million   and   $174 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  If we were not able to securitize receivables under either the U.S. or European securitization programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase. These accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing, and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. 
  In our U.S. accounts receivable securitization programs, we transfer a partial interest in a pool of receivables and the interest that we retain is subordinate to the transferred interest. Accordingly, we account for our U.S. securitization program as a secured borrowing. In our European programs, we transfer accounts receivables in their entirety to the acquiring entities and satisfy all of the conditions established under ASC Topic 860,  Transfers and Servicing,  to report the transfer of financial

assets in their entirety as a sale. The fair value of assets received as proceeds in exchange for the transfer of accounts receivable under our European securitization programs approximates the fair value of such receivables. We recognized   $1 million   interest expense in each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $2 million   in each of the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , relating to our U.S. securitization program. In addition, we recognized a loss of   $1 million   in each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $4 million   and   $3 million   in the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, on the sale of trade accounts receivable in our European accounts receivable securitization programs, representing the discount from book values at which these receivables were sold to our banks. The discount rate varies based on funding costs incurred by our banks, which averaged approximately   two percent   during the first nine months of both 2016 and 2015.  
   
           (6) 
    Restructuring and Other Charges 
     Over the past several years, we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations. These plans were approved by our Board of Directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business. For the full year 2015, we incurred   $63 million   in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of   $10 million  , primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, headcount reductions in Australia and South America, and the closure of a JIT plant in Australia, of which   $46 million   was recorded in cost of sales,   $11 million   in SG A,   $1 million   in engineering expense,   $1 million   in other expense and   $4 million   in depreciation and amortization expense. In the third quarter of 2016, we incurred   $7 million   in restructuring and related costs, primarily related to manufacturing footprint improvements in North America Ride Performance as well as headcount reduction and cost improvement initiatives in Europe and China Clean Air, of which   $3 million   was recorded in cost of sales and   $4 million   in SG A. In the third quarter of 2015, we incurred   $35 million   in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of   $9 million  , primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, and headcount reductions in Australia and South America, of which   $27 million   was recorded in cost of sales,   $3 million   in SG A,   $1 million   in engineering expense and   $4 million   in depreciation and amortization expense. In the first nine months of 2016, we incurred   $26 million   in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of   $5 million  , primarily related to manufacturing footprint improvements in North America Ride Performance as well as headcount reduction and cost improvement initiatives in Europe and China Clean Air and South America, of which   $9 million   was recorded in cost of sales,   $12 million   in SG A,   $2 million   in other expense and   $3 million   in depreciation and amortization expense. In the first nine months of 2015, we incurred   $47 million   in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of   $9 million  , primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, headcount reductions in Australia and South America and the closure of a JIT plant in Australia, of which   $37 million   was recorded in cost of sales,   $5 million   in SG A,   $1 million   in engineering expense and   $4 million   in depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Amounts related to activities that are part of our restructuring reserves are as follows: 

On January 31, 2013, we announced our intent to reduce structural costs in Europe by approximately   $60 million   annually. During the first quarter of 2016, we reached an annualized run rate on this cost reduction initiative of   $49 million  . With the disposition of the Gijon plant, which was completed at the end of the first quarter, the annualized rate essentially reached our target of   $55 million  , at the current exchange rates. In the third quarter of 2016, we incurred   $7 million   in restructuring and related costs, of which   $1 million   was related to this initiative. In the first nine months of 2016, we incurred   $26 million   in restructuring and related costs, of which   $16 million   was related to this initiative. While we are nearing the completion of this initiative, we expect to incur additional restructuring and related costs in 2016 due to certain ongoing matters. For example, we closed the Gijon plant in 2013, but subsequently re-opened it in July 2014 with about half of its prior workforce after the employees' works council successfully filed suit challenging the closure decision. Pursuant to an agreement we entered into with employee representatives, we engaged in a sales process for the facility. In March of 2016, we signed an agreement to transfer ownership of the manufacturing facility in Gijon, Spain to German private equity fund Quantum Capital Partners A.G. (QCP). The transfer to QCP was effective March 31, 2016 and under a three year manufacturing agreement, QCP will also continue as a supplier to Tenneco.   
  On July 22, 2015, we announced our intention to discontinue our Marzocchi motorcycle fork suspension product line and our mountain bike suspension product line, and liquidate our Marzocchi operations. These actions were subject to a  
  
   19

  (Unaudited) 

consultation process with the employee representatives and in total eliminated approximately   138   jobs. We employed   127   people at the Marzocchi plant in Bologna, Italy and an additional   11   people in our operations in North America and Taiwan.  In November 2015, we closed on the sale of certain assets related to our Marzocchi mountain bike suspension product line to the affiliates of Fox Factory Holding Corp.; and in December 2015, we closed on the sale of the Marzocchi motorcycle fork product line to an Italian company, VRM S.p.A. These actions were a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our Ride Performance product line globally while continuously improving our operations and increasing profitability. We recorded charges of   $29 million   in 2015 related to severance and other employee related costs, asset write-downs and other expenses related to these sales. 
  Under the terms of our amended and restated senior credit agreement that took effect on December 8, 2014, we are allowed to exclude up to   $150 million   in the aggregate of all costs, expenses, fees, fines, penalties, judgments, legal settlements and other amounts associated with any restructuring, litigation, claim, proceeding or investigation related to or undertaken by us or any of our subsidiaries, together with any related provision for taxes, incurred after December 8, 2014 in the calculation of the financial covenant ratios required under our senior credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had excluded   $74 million   of allowable charges relating to restructuring initiatives against the   $150 million   available under the terms of the senior credit facility.  
   
           (7) 
    Environmental Matters, Legal Proceedings and Product Warranties 
     We are involved in environmental remediation matters, legal proceedings, claims, investigations and warranty obligations. These matters are typically incidental to the conduct of our business and create the potential for contingent losses. We accrue for potential contingent losses when our review of available facts indicates that it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Each quarter we assess our loss contingencies based upon currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors and record adjustments to these reserves as required. As an example, we consider all available evidence, including prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies  cleanup experiences and data released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations when we evaluate our environmental remediation contingencies. All of our loss contingency estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information. With respect to our environmental liabilities, where future cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable, we have discounted those liabilities. We evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and, when they are assured, recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our consolidated financial statements. 
  Environmental Matters 
  We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We expense or capitalize, as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations. We expense costs related to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have the obligation to remediate or contribute towards the remediation of certain sites, including   one   Federal Superfund site. At   September 30, 2016  , our aggregated estimated share of environmental remediation costs for all these sites on a discounted basis was approximately   $16 million  , of which   $2 million   is recorded in other current liabilities and   $14 million   is recorded in deferred credits and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. For those locations where the liability was discounted, the weighted average discount rate used was   1.7 percent  . The undiscounted value of the estimated remediation costs was   $19 million  . Our expected payments of environmental remediation costs are estimated to be approximately   $1 million   in 2016,   $2 million   in 2017,   $1 million   in each year beginning 2018 through 2020 and   $13 million   in aggregate thereafter. 
  Based on information known to us, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for these costs. Although we believe these estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information, the costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. At some sites, we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs. In addition, certain environmental statutes provide that our liability could be joint and several, meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at these sites has been considered, where appropriate, in our determination of our estimated liability. We do not believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the Federal Superfund site, or as a liable party at the other locations referenced herein, will be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Antitrust Investigations and Litigation 
  On March 25, 2014, representatives of the European Commission were at Tenneco GmbH's Edenkoben, Germany administrative facility to gather information in connection with an ongoing global antitrust investigation concerning multiple automotive suppliers. On March 25, 2014, we also received a related subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ").  
  On November 5, 2014, the DOJ granted us conditional leniency pursuant to an agreement we entered into under the Antitrust Division's Corporate Leniency Policy. This agreement provides us with important benefits in exchange for our self-reporting of matters to the DOJ and our continuing full cooperation with the DOJ's resulting investigation. For example, the DOJ will not bring any criminal antitrust prosecution against us, nor seek any criminal fines or penalties, in connection with the matters we reported to the DOJ. Additionally, there are limits on our liability related to any follow on civil antitrust litigation in the U.S. The limits include single rather than treble damages, as well as relief from joint and several antitrust liability with other relevant civil antitrust action defendants. These limits are subject to our satisfying the DOJ and any court presiding over such follow on civil litigation.   
  Certain other competition agencies are also investigating possible violations of antitrust laws relating to products supplied by our company. We have cooperated and continue to cooperate fully with all of these antitrust investigations, and take other actions to minimize our potential exposure. 
  Tenneco and certain of its competitors are also currently defendants in civil putative class action litigation in the United States. More related lawsuits may be filed, including in other jurisdictions. Plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that defendants have engaged in anticompetitive conduct, in violation of federal and state laws, relating to the sale of automotive exhaust systems or components thereof. Plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and various purported classes of purchasers, injunctive relief, damages and attorneys  fees. However, as explained above, because we received conditional leniency from the DOJ, our civil liability in these follow on actions is limited to single damages and we will not be jointly and severally liable with the other defendants, provided that we have satisfied our obligations under the DOJ leniency agreement and approval is granted by the presiding court. 
  Antitrust law investigations, civil litigation, and related matters often continue for several years and can result in significant penalties and liability. We intend to vigorously defend the company and/or take other actions to minimize our potential exposure. In light of the many uncertainties and variables involved, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact that these matters may have on our company. Further, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Other Legal Proceedings, Claims and Investigations 
  We are also from time to time involved in other legal proceedings, claims or investigations. Some of these matters involve allegations of damages against us relating to environmental liabilities (including toxic tort, property damage and remediation), intellectual property matters (including patent, trademark and copyright infringement, and licensing disputes), personal injury claims (including injuries due to product failure, design or warning issues, and other product liability related matters), taxes, employment matters, and commercial or contractual disputes, sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures. Additionally, some of these matters involve allegations relating to legal compliance. For example, in the U.S. we are subject to an audit in   11   states with respect to the payment of unclaimed property to those states, spanning a period as far back as over   30 years  . While we vigorously defend ourselves against all of these legal proceedings, claims and investigations and take other actions to minimize our potential exposure, in future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved on unfavorable terms. Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on current information, including our assessment of the merits of the particular claim, except as described above under "Antitrust Investigations," we do not expect the legal proceedings, claims or investigations currently pending against us will have any material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
  In addition, for many years we have been and continue to be subject to lawsuits initiated by claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos. Our current docket of active and inactive cases is less than   500   cases nationwide. A small number of claims have been asserted against one of our subsidiaries by railroad workers alleging exposure to asbestos products in railroad cars. The substantial majority of the remaining claims are related to alleged exposure to asbestos in our automotive products although a significant number of those claims appear also to involve occupational exposures sustained in industries other than automotive. We believe, based on scientific and other evidence, it is unlikely that claimants were exposed to asbestos by our former products and that, in any event, they would not be at increased risk of asbestos-related disease based on their work with these products. Further, many of these cases involve numerous defendants, with the number in some cases exceeding   100   defendants from a variety of industries. Additionally, in many cases the plaintiffs either do not specify any, or specify the jurisdictional minimum, dollar amount for damages. As major asbestos manufacturers and/or users continue to go out of business or file for bankruptcy, we may experience an increased number of these claims. We vigorously defend ourselves

against these claims as part of our ordinary course of business. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us. To date, with respect to claims that have proceeded sufficiently through the judicial process, we have regularly achieved favorable resolutions. Accordingly, we presently believe that these asbestos-related claims will not have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Warranty Matters 
  We provide warranties on some of our products. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified with our products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims. We actively study trends of our warranty claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. We believe that the warranty reserve is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserve. The reserve is included in both current and long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. 
  Below is a table that shows the activity in the warranty accrual accounts:

    Earnings Per Share 
     Earnings per share of common stock outstanding were computed as follows: 

Options to purchase   171,580   and   175,343   shares of common stock were outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive.

    Common Stock 
     Equity Plans     We have granted a variety of awards, including common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), and stock options to our directors, officers, and employees. 
  Accounting Methods     We recorded compensation expense (net of taxes) of less than   $1 million   in the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   $1 million   in the three month period ended   September 30, 2015   and   $1 million   and   $3 million   in compensation expense for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectfully, related to nonqualified stock options as part of our selling, general and administrative expense. This had no impact on basic or diluted earnings per share for each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and resulted in a decrease of   $0.01   in both basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  
  For employees eligible to retire at the grant date, we immediately expense stock options and restricted stock. If employees become eligible to retire during the vesting period, we immediately recognize any remaining expense associated with their stock options and restricted stock. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was less than   $1 million   of unrecognized compensation costs related to our stock option awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of   0.3   years. 
  Compensation expense for restricted stock, restricted stock units, long-term performance units and SARs (net of taxes) was   $5 million   and   $1 million   for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $14 million   and   $10 million   for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  Cash received from stock option exercises for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   $4 million   and   $1 million  , respectively.     
  Stock options exercised in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015   generated a tax benefit of   $1 million   and   $6 million  , respectively. We started to record this tax effect in the third quarter of 2013 when we began utilizing our federal and state NOLs. 
  Stock Options     The following table reflects the status and activity for all options to purchase common stock for the period indicated: 

There were no stock options granted in 2015 or 2016. The total fair value of shares vested from options that were granted prior to 2015 was   $4 million   for both periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.

Restricted Stock     The following table reflects the status for all nonvested restricted shares for the period indicated: 

The fair value of restricted stock grants is usually equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the date of grant. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $15 million   of total unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.0   years. The total fair value of restricted shares vested was   $9 million   and   $6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  In January 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing our company to repurchase up to   $350 million   of our outstanding common stock over a   three   year period. This repurchase program does not obligate Tenneco to make repurchases at any specific time or situation and is part of our overall capital allocation strategy. In October 2015, our Board of Directors expanded our company's share repurchase plan, authorizing the repurchase of an additional   $200 million   of our company's outstanding common stock. This authorization is in addition to the   $350 million   share repurchase program our company announced in January 2015. We repurchased   2.8 million   shares for   $146 million   through this program in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Since we announced the current share repurchase program in January 2015, we have repurchased   7.0 million   shares for   $359 million   through   September 30, 2016  .    
  Treasury stock shares including repurchased shares were   10,256,389   and   7,473,325   shares at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Long-Term Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and SARs     Long-term performance units, restricted stock units and SARs are paid in cash and recognized as a liability based upon their fair value. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $21 million   of total unrecognized compensation costs is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   1.0   years.

      Pension Plans, Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits 
     Net periodic pension costs and postretirement benefit costs consist of the following components: 

For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we made pension contributions of   $2 million   and   $10 million   for our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. Based on current actuarial estimates, we believe we will be required to contribute approximately   $32 million   for the remainder of   2016  , which includes estimated contributions for the pension buyout referenced below. Pension contributions beyond   2016   will be required, but those amounts will vary based upon many factors including, for example, the performance of our pension fund investments during   2016  . 
  In February 2016, the Company launched a voluntary program to buy out active employees and retirees who have earned benefits in the U.S. pension plans and announced that the program is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. We will record a non-cash charge at that time. Cash payments to those who elect to take the buyout will be made from pension plan assets. 
  We made postretirement contributions of approximately   $6 million   during the first nine months of   2016  . Based on current actuarial estimates, we believe we will be required to contribute approximately   $3 million   for the remainder of   2016  . 
  The assets of some of our pension plans are invested in trusts that permit commingling of the assets of more than one employee benefit plan for investment and administrative purposes. Each of the plans participating in the trust has interests in the net assets of the underlying investment pools of the trusts. The investments for all our pension plans are recorded at estimated fair value, in compliance with the accounting guidance on fair value measurement.

    New Accounting Pronouncements 
     In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this update create Topic 842, Leases, and supersede the leases requirements in Topic 840, Leases.  Topic 842 specifies the accounting for leases. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flow arising from a lease. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. We will adopt this amendment on January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). ASU No. 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Such investments should be disclosed separate from the fair value hierarchy. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements but will impact pension asset disclosure in our annual report on Form 10-K going forward.

In May 2014, the FASB issued an amendment on revenue recognition. The amendment in this update creates Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendment supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts, and creates new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017 for public entities. We will adopt this amendment on January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

     Segment Information 
     We are organized and manage our business along our   two   major product lines (clean air and ride performance) and   three   geographic areas (North America; Europe, South America and India; and Asia Pacific), resulting in   six   operating segments (North America Clean Air, North America Ride Performance, Europe, South America and India Clean Air, Europe, South America and India Ride Performance, Asia Pacific Clean Air and Asia Pacific Ride Performance). Within each geographical area, each operating segment manufactures and distributes either clean air or ride performance products primarily for the original equipment and aftermarket industries. Each of the   six   operating segments constitutes a reportable segment. Costs related to other business activities, primarily corporate headquarter functions, are disclosed separately from the six operating segments as "Other." We evaluate segment performance based primarily on earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests. Products are transferred between segments and geographic areas on a basis intended to reflect as nearly as possible the  market value  of the products.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  As you read the following review of our financial condition and results of operations, you should also read our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page 6. 
  Executive Summary 
  We are one of the world's leading manufacturers of clean air and ride performance products and systems for light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway applications. We serve both original equipment (OE) vehicle designers and manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets, or aftermarket, globally through leading brands, including Monroe       , Rancho       , Clevite        Elastomers, Axios       , Kinetic        and Fric-Rot        ride performance products and Walker       , XNOx       , Fonos       , DynoMax        and Thrush         clean air products. We serve more than 80 different original equipment manufacturers and commercial truck and off-highway engine manufacturers, and our products are included on nine of the top 10 car models produced for sale in Europe and eight of the top 10 light truck models produced for sale in North America for 2015. Our aftermarket customers are comprised of full-line and specialty warehouse distributors, retailers, jobbers, installer chains and car dealers. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 93 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employed approximately 30,000 people to service our customers' demands.  
  Factors that continue to be critical to our success include winning new business awards, managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes and reducing overall costs. In addition, our ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as a shift in consumer preferences to other vehicles in response to higher fuel costs and other economic and social factors, increasing technologically sophisticated content, changing aftermarket distribution channels, increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts, also play a critical role in our success. Other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the impact of any such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives and other methods.  
  For the third quarter of 2016, light vehicle production was up two percent in North America, 14 percent in India and 24 percent in China compared to the third quarter of 2015. Light vehicle production was down two percent in Europe, 10 percent in South America and six percent in Australia in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  
  Total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $2,096 million, up four percent from $2,025 million in the third quarter of 2015 on strong global light vehicle revenues, driven by both the Clean Air and Ride Performance product lines. Excluding the impact of currency and substrate sales, revenue was up $93 million, or six percent, from $1,550 million to $1,643 million. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by stronger OE light vehicle volumes mainly in Europe, South America and India and China as well as new platforms in Europe and China, which were partially offset by lower aftermarket and lower commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues mainly in North America. 
  Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2016 was $1,741 million, or 83.1 percent of sales, compared to $1,707 million, or 84.3 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2015. The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in cost of sales ($ millions). 

The increase in cost of sales was due to the year-over-year increase in volume and higher other costs, mainly manufacturing, partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates, lower net material costs and lower restructuring. 
  Gross margin: Revenue less cost of sales for the third quarter of 2016 was $355 million, or 16.9 percent, versus $318 million, or 15.7 percent, in the third quarter of 2015. The effect on gross margin resulting from year-over-year increase in volume, lower net material costs and lower restructuring was partially offset by higher other costs, mainly manufacturing.  
  Engineering, research and development: Engineering, research and development expense was $41 million and $35 million in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A): SG A expense was down $4 million in the third quarter of 2016 at $109 million compared to $113 million in the third quarter of 2015.

Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense was $53 million in each of the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. 
  Earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests ( EBIT ) was $152 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $36 million when compared to $116 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Higher OE light vehicle volumes in Europe, South America and India and China, new platforms in Europe and China as well as lower restructuring and related expenses were partially offset by lower aftermarket and lower commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues mainly in North America. EBIT for the third quarter of 2015 also benefited from the timing of a customer recovery in China Clean Air of $5 million. 
  Total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 were $6,444 million, up four percent from $6,178 million in the first nine months of 2015 on strong global light vehicle revenues, driven by both the Clean Air and Ride Performance product lines. Excluding the impact of currency and substrate sales, revenue was up $327 million, or seven percent, from $4,744 million to $5,071 million. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by stronger OE light vehicle volumes in North America Clean Air, Europe, South America and India and China and increased aftermarket Ride Performance sales in Europe and South America, new platforms in North America, Europe and China as well as higher commercial truck, off-highway and other Clean Air revenue, which were partially offset by lower commercial truck, off-highway and other Ride Performance revenue mainly in North America and Europe and lower aftermarket revenue in North America. 
  Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): Cost of sales for the first nine months of 2016 was $5,321 million, or 82.6 percent of sales, compared to $5,157 million, or 83.5 percent of sales in the first nine months of 2015. The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in cost of sales ($ millions). 

The increase in cost of sales was due to the year-over-year increase in volume and higher other costs, mainly manufacturing, partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rates, lower net material costs and lower restructuring. 
  Gross margin: Revenue less cost of sales for the first nine months of 2016 was $1,123 million, or 17.4 percent, versus $1,021 million, or 16.5 percent, in the first nine months of 2015. The effect on gross margin resulting from year-over-year increase in volume, lower net material costs and lower restructuring was partially offset by higher other costs, mainly manufacturing, and unfavorable currency.  
  Engineering, research and development: Engineering, research and development expense was $117 million and $114 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A): SG A expense was up $31 million in the first nine months of 2016 at $390 million compared to $359 million in the first nine months of 2015.  
  Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense was $159 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared to $154 million in the first nine months of 2015. 
  EBIT was $453 million for the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $62 million when compared to $391 million in the first nine months of the prior year. Higher OE light vehicle volumes in North America Clean Air, Europe, South America and India and China, increased aftermarket Ride Performance sales in Europe and South America , new platforms in North America, Europe and China, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other Clean Air revenue, the benefit of our product cost leadership initiatives, lower restructuring and related expenses and savings from previous restructuring activities were partially offset by lower commercial truck, off-highway and other Ride Performance revenue mainly in North America and Europe, lower aftermarket revenue in North America, higher SG A and engineering expenses and $23 million of negative currency. EBIT for the first nine months of 2015 also benefited from the timing of a customer recovery in China Clean Air of $5 million. 
   
  Results from Operations 
  The tables below reflect our revenues for the three months and nine months periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We show the component of our OE revenue represented by substrate sales. While we generally have primary design, engineering and manufacturing responsibility for OE emission control systems, we do not manufacture substrates. Substrates  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

are porous ceramic filters coated with a catalyst - typically, precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. These are supplied to us by Tier 2 suppliers generally as directed by our OE customers. We generally earn a small margin on these components of the system. As the need for more sophisticated emission control solutions increases to meet more stringent environmental regulations, and as we capture more diesel aftertreatment business, these substrate components have been increasing as a percentage of our revenue. While these substrates dilute our gross margin percentage, they are a necessary component of an emission control system.  
  Our value-add content in an emission control system includes designing the system to meet environmental regulations through integration of the substrates into the system, maximizing use of thermal energy to heat up the catalyst quickly, efficiently managing airflow to reduce back pressure as the exhaust stream moves past the catalyst, managing the expansion and contraction of the emission control system components due to temperature extremes experienced by an emission control system, using advanced acoustic engineering tools to design the desired exhaust sound, minimizing the opportunity for the fragile components of the substrate to be damaged when we integrate it into the emission control system and reducing unwanted noise, vibration and harshness transmitted through the emission control system. 
  We present these substrate sales separately in the following table because we believe investors utilize this information to understand the impact of this portion of our revenues on our overall business and because it removes the impact of potentially volatile precious metals pricing from our revenues. While our original equipment customers generally assume the risk of precious metals pricing volatility, it impacts our reported revenues. Presenting revenues that exclude  substrates  used in catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters removes this impact.  
  Additionally, we present these reconciliations of revenues in order to reflect value-add revenues without the effect of changes in foreign currency rates. We have not reflected any currency impact in the 2015 table since this is the base period for measuring the effects of currency during 2016 on our operations. We believe investors find this information useful in understanding period-to-period comparisons in our revenues.

EBIT for Asia Pacific increased to $38 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $27 million in the first nine months of 2015, mainly driven by higher light vehicle volumes in China and lower restructuring and related expenses which were partially offset by higher SG A and engineering expenses and negative currency. For the Ride Performance division, restructuring and related expenses of $23 million were included in EBIT for the first nine months of 2016 and $40 million for the same period in 2015. Currency had a $6 million unfavorable impact on EBIT of the Ride Performance division for the first nine months of 2016 when compared to last year.  
  Currency had a $23 million unfavorable impact on overall company EBIT for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of prior year. 
  EBIT as a Percentage of Revenue for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

In the Clean Air division, EBIT as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months of 2016 was up one percentage point compared to the first nine months of last year. In North America, EBIT as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months of 2016 was even compared to the first nine months of last year. The benefit from higher OE light vehicle sales, new platforms and favorable currency was offset by lower aftermarket revenue, lower commercial truck and off-highway vehicle revenue and higher SG A expense. Europe, South America and India's EBIT as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months of 2016 was up two percentage points compared to the first nine months of prior year. The benefit from higher light vehicle volumes, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenue, favorable mix and new platforms in Europe as well as lower restructuring and related expenses and year-over-year restructuring savings was partially offset by negative currency. EBIT as a percentage of revenues for Asia Pacific in the first nine months of 2016 was up two percentage points compared to the first nine months of 2015. EBIT benefited from increased OE light vehicle sales and new platforms in China and higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenue in China and Japan, strong operational cost management and lower restructuring and related expenses, partially offset by higher SG A expense, negative currency and the timing of a customer recovery in China.  
  In the Ride Performance division, EBIT as a percentage of revenues was up two percentage points compared to the first nine months of prior year. In the first nine months of 2016, EBIT as a percentage of revenues for North America was up one percentage point compared to the first nine months of 2015. The benefit of improved operational cost management was partially offset by lower volumes in light vehicle, commercial truck volumes, lower aftermarket volumes net of favorable mix, higher restructuring and related expenses and higher SG A. EBIT as a percentage of revenues in Europe, South America and India was up two percentage points compared to the first nine months of prior year. The benefit from higher light vehicle sales in the region, higher aftermarket sales in Europe and South America, lower restructuring and related expenses and savings from prior

restructuring activities was partially offset by unfavorable mix in Europe, lower commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenue in Europe reflecting the sale of the Marzocchi specialty business and negative currency. In Asia Pacific, EBIT as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months of 2016 was up four percentage points compared to the first nine months of last year, mainly driven by higher light vehicle volumes in China and lower restructuring and related expenses which were partially offset by higher SG A and engineering expenses and negative currency.  
  Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized 
  We reported interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 of $24 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $1 million, and $16 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. Included in the third quarter of 2016 was $8 million of expense related to the completion of our refinancing activities which were initiated in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the refinancing expenses, interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 was even compared to the interest expense in the prior year. 
  We reported interest expense in the first nine months of 2016 of $76 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $4 million, and $49 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $5 million in the first nine months of 2015. Included in the first nine months of 2016 was $24 million of expense related to the completion of our refinancing activities which were initiated in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the refinancing expenses, interest expense increased by $3 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior year. 
  On September 30, 2016, we had $743 million in long-term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates. Of that amount, $500 million is fixed through July 2026, $225 million is fixed through December 2024, and the remainder is fixed from 2016 through 2025. We also have $584 million in long-term debt obligations that are subject to variable interest rates. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Capitalization  later in this Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
  Income Taxes 
  We reported income tax benefit of $69 million and income tax expense of $34 million in the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2016 included a net tax benefit of $105 million primarily relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes. During the third quarter, we completed our detailed analysis of our ability to recognize and utilize foreign tax credits within the carryforward period. As a result, we amended our U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2006 to 2012 to claim foreign tax credits in lieu of deducting foreign taxes paid. The U.S. foreign tax credit law provides for a credit against U.S. taxes otherwise payable for foreign taxes paid with regard to dividends, interest and royalties paid to us in the U.S. The tax expense recorded in the third quarter of 2015 included a net tax benefit of $12 million primarily relating to prior year U.S. research and development tax credits.  
  We reported income tax expense of $5 million and $122 million in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax expense recorded in the first nine months of 2016 included a net tax benefit of $106 million primarily relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes as described above. The tax expense recorded in the first nine months of 2015 included a net tax benefit of $9 million primarily relating to prior year U.S. research and development tax credits, prior year intercompany transactions and tax adjustments to prior year income tax estimates. 
  We believe it is reasonably possible that up to $22 million in unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of foreign statute of limitations and the conclusion of income tax examinations may be recognized within the next twelve months. 
  Restructuring and Other Charges 
  Over the past several years, we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations. These plans were approved by our Board of Directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business. For the full year 2015, we incurred $63 million in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of $10 million, primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, headcount reductions in Australia and South America, and the closure of a JIT plant in Australia, of which $46 million was recorded in cost of sales, $11 million in SG A, $1 million in engineering expense, $1 million in other expense and $4 million in depreciation and amortization expense. In the third quarter of 2016, we incurred $7 million in restructuring and related costs, primarily related to manufacturing footprint improvements in North America Ride Performance as well as headcount reduction and cost improvement initiatives in Europe and China Clean Air, of which $3 million was recorded in cost of sales and $4 million in SG A. In the third quarter of 2015, we incurred $35 million in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of $9 million, primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, and headcount reductions in Australia and South America, of which $27 million was recorded in cost of sales, $3 million in SG A, $1 million in engineering expense and $4 million in depreciation and amortization expense. In the first nine months of 2016, we incurred $26 million in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of $5 million, primarily related to manufacturing footprint improvements in North America Ride Performance as well as headcount reduction and cost improvement initiatives in

Europe and China Clean Air and South America, of which $9 million was recorded in cost of sales, $12 million in SG A, $2 million in other expense and $3 million in depreciation and amortization expense. In the first nine months of 2015, we incurred $47 million in restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of $9 million, primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, headcount reductions in Australia and South America and the closure of a JIT plant in Australia, of which $37 million was recorded in cost of sales, $5 million in SG A, $1 million in engineering expense and $4 million in depreciation and amortization expense.  
  Amounts related to activities that are part of our restructuring reserves are as follows: 

On January 31, 2013, we announced our intent to reduce structural costs in Europe by approximately $60 million annually. During the first quarter of 2016, we reached an annualized run rate on this cost reduction initiative of   $49 million  . With the disposition of the Gijon plant, which was completed at the end of the first quarter, the annualized rate essentially reached our target of   $55 million  , at the current exchange rates. In the third quarter of 2016, we incurred $7 million in restructuring and related costs, of which $1 million was related to this initiative. In the first nine months of 2016, we incurred $26 million in restructuring and related costs, of which $16 million was related to this initiative. While we are nearing the completion of this initiative, we expect to incur additional restructuring and related costs in 2016 due to certain ongoing matters. For example, we closed the Gijon plant in 2013, but subsequently re-opened it in July 2014 with about half of its prior workforce after the employees' works council successfully filed suit challenging the closure decision. Pursuant to an agreement we entered into with employee representatives, we engaged in a sales process for the facility. In March of 2016, we signed an agreement to transfer ownership of the aftermarket shock absorber manufacturing facility in Gijon, Spain to German private equity fund Quantum Capital Partners A.G. (QCP). The transfer to QCP was effective March 31, 2016 and under a three year manufacturing agreement, QCP will also continue as a supplier to Tenneco. 
  On July 22, 2015, we announced our intention to discontinue our Marzocchi motorcycle fork suspension product line and our mountain bike suspension product line, and liquidate our Marzocchi operations. These actions were subject to a consultation process with the employee representatives and in total eliminated approximately 138 jobs. We employed 127 people at the Marzocchi plant in Bologna, Italy and an additional 11 people in our operations in North America and Taiwan. In November 2015, we closed on the sale of certain assets related to our Marzocchi mountain bike suspension product line to the affiliates of Fox Factory Holding Corp.; and in December 2015, we closed on the sale of the Marzocchi motorcycle fork product line to an Italian company, VRM S.p.A. These actions were a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our Ride Performance product line globally while continuously improving our operations and increasing profitability. We recorded charges of $29 million in 2015 related to severance and other employee related costs, asset write-downs and other expenses related to these sales. We anticipate improving financial results by approximately $5 million annually, beginning in 2016. 
           Under the terms of our amended and restated senior credit agreement that took effect on December 8, 2014, we are allowed to exclude up to $150 million in the aggregate of all costs, expenses, fees, fines, penalties, judgments, legal settlements and other amounts associated with any restructuring, litigation, claim, proceeding or investigation related to or undertaken by us or any of our subsidiaries, together with any related provision for taxes, incurred after December 8, 2014 in the calculation of the financial covenant ratios required under our senior credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, we had excluded $74 million of allowable charges relating to restructuring initiatives against the $150 million available under the terms of the senior credit facility. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  We reported net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. of $180 million or $3.21 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2016. Included in the results for the third quarter of 2016 was positive impact from net tax benefit partially offset by negative impacts from expenses related to our restructuring activities and costs related to our refinancing activities. The total impact of these items increased earnings per diluted share by $1.68. We reported net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. of $52 million or $0.88 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2015. Included in the results for the third quarter of 2015 were negative impacts from expenses related to our restructuring activities offset partially by net tax benefits. The total impact of these items decreased earnings per diluted share by $0.34.  
  We reported net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. of $323 million or $5.67 per diluted common share for the first nine months of 2016. Included in the results for the first nine months quarter of 2016 were positive impact from net tax benefit partially offset by negative impacts from expenses related to our restructuring activities and costs related to our refinancing

activities. The total impact of these items increased earnings per diluted share by $1.18. We reported net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. of $179 million or $2.94 per diluted common share for the first nine months of 2015. Included in the results for the first nine months of 2015 were negative impacts from expenses related to our restructuring activities offset partially by net tax benefits. The total impact of these items decreased earnings per diluted share by $0.55.  
  Dividends on Common Stock 
  On January 10, 2001, our Board of Directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock. There are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock.

  Outlook 
  All our forward looking revenue estimates reflect constant currency. We expect total revenue growth of three percent in the fourth quarter 2016. Higher light vehicle revenue is expected to outpace global light vehicle industry production. Commercial truck revenue will be roughly in line with industry truck production and off-highway revenue is expected to be down year-over-year, reflecting further weakness in the Europe and North America off-highway markets compared with a year ago. In total, OE commercial truck and off-highway revenue is expected to be similar to the third quarter revenues. The global aftermarket is expected to make a solid contribution in the fourth quarter.   
  For the full year, we expect to outpace aggregate industry production by three percent for total revenue growth of six percent year-over-year. Additionally, we expect to deliver adjusted margin improvement for the full year. 
  We also expect revenue growth outpacing industry production in 2017 and 2018 as indicated in our January 2016 revenue estimates. 
  Tenneco's revenue projections are based on the type of information set forth under "Outlook" in Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as set forth in Tenneco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Please see that disclosure for further information. Additionally, revenue assumptions for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 are based on current and projected customer production schedules as well as aggregate industry production, which includes IHS Automotive October 2016 global light vehicle production forecasts, Power Systems Research (PSR) October 2016 forecast for global commercial truck and buses, PSR off-highway engine production in North America and Europe and Tenneco estimates. Unless otherwise indicated, our revenue estimate methodology does not attempt to forecast currency fluctuation, and accordingly reflects constant currency.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We recognize revenue for sales to our original equipment and aftermarket customers when title and risk of loss passes to the customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers, which is usually at the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers. Generally, in connection with the sale of exhaust systems to certain original equipment manufacturers, we purchase catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters or components thereof including precious metals ( substrates ) on behalf of our customers which are used in the assembled system. These substrates are included in our inventory and  passed through  to the customer at our cost, plus a small margin, since we take title to the inventory and are responsible for both the delivery and quality of the finished product. Revenues recognized for substrate sales were   $1,513 million   and   $1,434 million   for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. For our aftermarket customers, we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the time of sale. Estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and historical experience with returns. Certain taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, such as value added taxes, are excluded from revenue and recorded on a net basis. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenues and the related costs are included in cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  Warranty Reserves 
  Where we have offered product warranty, we also provide for warranty costs. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified with our products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and upon specific warranty issues as they arise. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. We actively study trends of our warranty claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. While we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs, it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Pre-production Design and Development and Tooling Assets 
  We expense pre-production design and development costs as incurred unless we have a contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the original equipment customer. Unbilled pre-production design and development costs recorded in prepayments and other and long-term receivables totaled $31 million and $21 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In addition, plant, property and equipment included $59 million and $64 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for original equipment tools and dies that we own, and prepayments and other included $134 million and $107 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for in-process tools and dies that we are building for our original equipment customers. 
  Income Taxes 
  We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values, and net operating losses ("NOL") and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis.  We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.   
  We evaluate our deferred income taxes quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted.  U.S. GAAP requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a "more likely than not" standard.  This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.  In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.  
  Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets based on a  more likely than not  threshold. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. We have considered the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets: 
  
   54 

     Table of Contents  

Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; 
                
    Taxable income or loss, based on recent results, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; 
                
    Tax-planning strategies; and 
                
    Taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the relevant tax law. 
     The valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions will impact our provision for income taxes until the valuation allowances are released. Our provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit for losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these jurisdictions until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated. 
  For interim tax reporting we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply it to our year to date ordinary income. Jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recognized due to a valuation allowance are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate. The impact of including these jurisdictions on the quarterly effective rate calculation could result in a higher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter due to the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections. The tax effects of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which they occur. 
  Goodwill, net 
  We evaluate goodwill for impairment as of October 31st each year, or more frequently if events indicate it is warranted. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. In step one, we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the unit s assets and liabilities to determine if impairment exists within the recorded balance of goodwill. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of market trends, forecasted revenues and expenses, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and other variables. A separate discount rate derived by a combination of published sources, internal estimates and weighted based on our debt and equity structure, was used to calculate the discounted cash flows for each of our reporting units. These estimates are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and outside of the control of management. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist which requires step two to be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value. 
  The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their assets and liabilities as October 31, 2015. 
  Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
  We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our employees. We also have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover some of our domestic employees. Our pension and postretirement health care and life insurance expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. Health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience while mortality rates are based upon the general population experience which is not expected to differ materially from our experience. 
  Our approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and foreign plans is generally based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the discount rate is determined using the results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan. Based on this approach, we raised the weighted average discount rate for all our pension plans to 3.9 percent in 2016 from 3.7 percent in   2015  . The discount rate for postretirement benefits was raised to 4.3 percent in   2016   from 4.1 percent in   2015  . 
  Our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns, and is adjusted for any expected changes in the long-term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets. As a result, our estimate of the weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets for all of our pension plans was lowered to 6.6 percent for   2016   from 6.7 percent for   2015  . 
  Except in the U.K., our pension plans generally do not require employee contributions. Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable U.S. and foreign government regulations and to make additional payments as funds are available to achieve full funding of the accumulated benefit obligation. As of   September 30, 2016  , all legal funding requirements have been met.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Capitalization 

General.   Short-term debt, which includes maturities classified as current, borrowings by foreign subsidiaries, and borrowings under our U.S. accounts receivable securitization program, was $124 million and $86 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which are classified as long-term debt, were $309 million and $105 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The   2016   year-to-date increase in Tenneco Inc. shareholders' equity primarily resulted from net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. of $323 million, a $11 million increase related to pension and postretirement benefits, a $10 million increase in premium on common stock and other capital surplus relating to common stock issued pursuant to benefit plans, and a $4 million increase caused by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the translation of financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars, partially offset by a $146 million increase in treasury stock as a result of purchases of common stock under our share purchase program. 
  Overview.   Our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. The arrangement is secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66 percent of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, as well as guarantees by our material domestic subsidiaries. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the senior credit facility provides us with a total revolving credit facility size of $1,200 million and had a $274 million balance outstanding under the Tranche A Term Facility, both of which will mature on December 8, 2019. Net carrying amount for the balance outstanding under the Tranche A Term Facility including a $2 million debt issuance cost was $272 million. Funds may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed under the revolving credit facility without premium or penalty (subject to any customary LIBOR breakage fees). The revolving credit facility is reflected as debt on our balance sheet only if we borrow money under this facility or if we use the facility to make payments for letters of credit. Outstanding letters of credit reduce our availability to borrow revolving loans under the facility. We are required to make quarterly principal payments under the Tranche A Term Facility of $3.75 million through December 31, 2016, $5.625 million beginning March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017, $7.5 million beginning March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2019 and a final payment of $195 million is due on December 8, 2019. We have excluded the required payments, within the next twelve months, under the Tranche A Term Facility totaling $21 million from current liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  , because we have the intent and ability to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis by using our revolving credit facility.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , of the   $1,200 million   available under the revolving credit facility, we had unused borrowing capacity of   $891 million   with   $309 million   in outstanding borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit. As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding debt also included (i)   $274 million   of a term loan which consisted of a   $272 million   net carrying amount including a   $2 million   debt issuance cost related to our Tranche A Term Facility which is subject to quarterly principal payments as described above through   December 8, 2019  , (ii)   $225 million   of notes which consisted of a   $221 million   net carrying amount including a   $4 million   debt issuance cost related to our 5   3   /   8    percent senior notes due   December 15, 2024  , (iii)   $500 million   of notes which consisted of a   $492 million   net carrying amount including a   $8 million   debt issuance cost related to our 5 percent senior notes due   July 15, 2026   (which were issued on June 13, 2016), and (iv)   $140 million   of other debt. 
  On June 6, 2016, we announced a cash tender offer to purchase our outstanding   $500 million   6   7   /8 percent senior notes due in 2020. We received tenders representing   $325 million   aggregate principal amount of the notes and, on June 13, 2016, we  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  

purchased the tendered notes at a price of 103.81 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On July 13, 2016, we redeemed the remaining outstanding   $175 million   aggregate principal amount of the notes that were not purchased pursuant to the tender offer at a price of 103.438 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We used the proceeds of the issuance of our 5 percent senior notes due 2026 to fund the purchase and redemption. The senior credit facility was used to fund the fees and expenses of the tender offer and redemption. 
  We recorded   $16 million   and   $8 million   of pre-tax interest charges in June and July of 2016, respectively, related to the repurchase and redemption of our 6   7   /8 percent senior notes due in 2020 and the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs relating to those notes. 
  We monitor market conditions with respect to the potential refinancing of our outstanding debt obligations, including our senior secured credit facility and senior notes. Depending on market and other conditions, we may seek to refinance our debt obligations from time to time. We cannot make any assurance, however, that any refinancing will be completed. 
  Senior Credit Facility   Interest Rates and Fees.   Beginning December 8, 2014, our Tranche A Term Facility and revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either (i) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin of 175 basis points, or (ii) a rate consisting of the greater of (a) the JPMorgan Chase prime rate plus a margin of 75 basis points, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points plus a margin of 75 basis points, and (c) one month LIBOR plus 100 basis points plus a margin of 75 basis points. The margin we pay on these borrowings will be increased by a total of 25 basis points above the original margin following each fiscal quarter for which our consolidated net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 and less than 3.25, and will be increased by a total of 50 basis points above the original margin following each fiscal quarter for which our consolidated net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 3.25. In addition, the margin we pay on these borrowings will be reduced by a total of 25 basis points below the original margin if our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than 1.25. We also pay a commitment fee equal to 30 basis points that will be reduced to 25 basis points or increased to up to 40 basis points depending on consolidated net leverage ratio changes as set forth in the senior credit facility. 
  Senior Credit Facility   Other Terms and Conditions.   Our senior credit facility requires that we maintain financial ratios equal to or better than the following consolidated net leverage ratio (consolidated indebtedness net of cash divided by consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the senior credit facility agreement), and consolidated interest coverage ratio (consolidated EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined in the senior credit facility agreement) at the end of each period indicated. Failure to maintain these ratios will result in a default under our senior credit facility. The financial ratios required under the amended and restated senior credit facility (or the predecessor facility, as applicable) and the actual ratios we achieved for the three quarters of 2016, are as follows: 

The senior credit facility includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of 3.50 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75, in each case through December 8, 2019. 
  The covenants in our senior credit facility agreement generally prohibit us from repaying or refinancing our senior notes. So long as no default existed, we would, however, under our senior credit facility agreement, be permitted to repay or refinance our senior notes (i) with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the senior credit facility agreement) or with the net cash proceeds of our common stock, in each case issued within 180 days prior to such repayment; (ii) with the net cash proceeds of the incremental facilities (as defined in the senior credit facility agreement) and certain indebtedness incurred by our foreign subsidiaries; (iii) with the proceeds of the revolving loans (as defined in the senior credit facility agreement); (iv) with the cash generated by our operations; (v) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the senior credit facility agreement) issued by us after December 8, 2014; and (vi) in exchange for permitted refinancing indebtedness or in exchange for shares of our common stock; provided that such purchases are capped as follows (with respect to clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) based on a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio after giving effect to such purchase, cancellation or redemption):

Although the senior credit facility agreement would permit us to repay or refinance our senior notes under the conditions described above, any repayment or refinancing of our outstanding notes would be subject to market conditions and either the voluntary participation of note holders or our ability to redeem the notes under the terms of the applicable note indenture. For example, while the senior credit facility agreement would allow us to repay our outstanding notes via a direct exchange of the notes for either permitted refinancing indebtedness or for shares of our common stock, we do not, under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding notes, have the right to refinance the notes via any type of direct exchange. 
  The senior credit facility agreement also contains other restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional liens; (ii) sale and leaseback transactions (except for the permitted transactions as described in the senior credit facility agreement); (iii) liquidations and dissolutions; (iv) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees; (v) investments and acquisitions; (vi) dividends and share repurchases; (vii) mergers and consolidations; and (viii) refinancing of the senior notes. Compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all the financial covenants and operational restrictions of the senior credit facility. Our senior credit facility does not contain any terms that could accelerate payment of the facility or affect pricing under the facility as a result of a credit rating agency downgrade. 
  Senior Notes.   As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding senior notes included $225 million of 5   3   /8 percent senior notes due December 15, 2024 which consisted of $221 million net carrying amount including a $4 million debt issuance cost and $500 million of 5 percent senior notes due July 15, 2026 which consisted of $492 million net carrying amount including a $8 million debt issuance cost. Under the indentures governing the remaining notes, we are permitted to redeem some or all of the remaining senior notes at specified prices that decline to par over a specified period, (a) on or after July 15, 2021, in case of the senior notes due 2026, and (b) on or after December 15, 2019, in the case of the senior notes due 2024. In addition, the notes may also be redeemed in whole or in part at a redemption price generally equal to 100 percent of the principal amount thereof plus a premium based on the present values of the remaining payments due to the note holders. Further, the indentures governing the notes also permit us to redeem up to 35 percent of the senior notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, (a) on or before July 15, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 105 percent, in case of the senior notes due 2026 and (b) on or before December 15, 2017 at a redemption price equal to 105.375 percent, in case of the senior notes due 2024. If we sell certain of our assets or experience specified kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the notes due 2026 and 2024 at 101 percent of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
  Our senior notes due, respectively, December 15, 2024 and July 15, 2026 contain covenants that will, among other things, limit our ability to create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. Our senior notes due 2024 also require that, as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro forma basis, be greater than 2.00, as well as containing restrictions on our operations, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional indebtedness; (ii) dividends; (iii) distributions and stock repurchases; (iv) investments; (v) asset sales and (vi) mergers and consolidations. Subject to limited exceptions, all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our senior notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures. 
  Accounts Receivable Securitization.   We securitize some of our accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis in the U.S. and Europe. As servicer under these accounts receivable securitization programs, we are responsible for performing all accounts receivable administration functions for these securitized financial assets including collections and processing of customer invoice adjustments. In the U.S., we have an accounts receivable securitization program with three commercial banks comprised of a first priority facility and a second priority facility. We securitize original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under the bank program. In March 2015, the U.S. program was amended and extended to April 30, 2017. The first priority facility provides financing of up to $130 million and the second priority facility, which is subordinated to the first priority facility, provides up to an additional $50 million of financing. Both facilities monetize accounts receivable generated in the U.S. that meet certain eligibility requirements. The second priority facility also monetizes certain accounts receivable generated in the U.S. that would otherwise be ineligible under the first priority securitization facility. The amount of  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  

outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable under the U.S. program was $50 million and $30 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Each facility contains customary covenants for financings of this type, including restrictions related to liens, payments, mergers or consolidations and amendments to the agreements underlying the receivables pool. Further, each facility may be terminated upon the occurrence of customary events (with customary grace periods, if applicable), including breaches of covenants, failure to maintain certain financial ratios, inaccuracies of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain changes in the rate of default or delinquency of the receivables, a change of control and the entry or other enforcement of material judgments. In addition, each facility contains cross-default provisions, where the facility could be terminated in the event of non-payment of other material indebtedness when due and any other event which permits the acceleration of the maturity of material indebtedness. 
  We also securitize receivables in our European operations with regional banks in Europe under various separate facilities.  The commitments for these arrangements are generally for one year, but some may be canceled with notice 90 days prior to renewal. In some instances, the arrangement provides for cancellation by the applicable financial institution at any time upon notification. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable in Europe was   $206 million   and   $174 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  If we were not able to securitize receivables under either the U.S. or European securitization programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase. These accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing, and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. 
  In our U.S. accounts receivable securitization programs, we transfer a partial interest in a pool of receivables and the interest that we retain is subordinate to the transferred interest. Accordingly, we account for our U.S. securitization program as a secured borrowing. In our European programs, we transfer accounts receivables in their entirety to the acquiring entities and satisfy all of the conditions established under ASC Topic 860,  Transfers and Servicing,  to report the transfer of financial assets in their entirety as a sale. The fair value of assets received as proceeds in exchange for the transfer of accounts receivable under our European securitization programs approximates the fair value of such receivables. We recognized   $1 million   interest expense in each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $2 million   in each of the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, relating to our U.S. securitization program. In addition, we recognized a loss of   $1 million   in each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $4 million   and   $3 million   in the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, on the sale of trade accounts receivable in our European accounts receivable securitization programs, representing the discount from book values at which these receivables were sold to our banks. The discount rate varies based on funding costs incurred by our banks. The discount rate varies based on funding costs incurred by our banks, which averaged approximately two percent during the first nine months of both   2016   and   2015  . 
  Financial Instruments.   One of our European subsidiaries receives payment from one of its customers whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the early delivery of financial instruments. We may collect these financial instruments before their maturity date by either selling them at a discount or using them to satisfy accounts receivable that have previously been sold to a European bank. Any of these financial instruments which are not sold are classified as other current assets. Such financial instruments held by our European subsidiary totaled zero and less than $1 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  In certain instances, several of our Chinese subsidiaries receive payment from customers through the receipt of financial instruments on the date the customer payments are due. Several of our Chinese subsidiaries also satisfy vendor payments through the delivery of financial instruments on the date the payments are due. Financial instruments issued to satisfy vendor payables and not redeemed totaled   $22 million   and $15 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and were classified as notes payable. Financial instruments received from OE customers and not redeemed totaled   $14 million   and $8 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We classify financial instruments received from our   customers as other current assets if issued by a financial institution of our customers or as customer notes and accounts, if issued by our customer. We classified   $14 million   and $8 million in other current assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The financial instruments received by one of our European subsidiaries and some of our Chinese subsidiaries are drafts drawn that are payable at a future date and, in some cases, are negotiable and/or are guaranteed by banks of the customers. The use of these instruments for payment follows local commercial practice. Because certain of such financial instruments are guaranteed by our customers  banks, we believe they represent a lower financial risk than the outstanding accounts receivable that they satisfy which are not guaranteed by a bank. 
  Supply Chain Financing.   Certain of our suppliers in the U.S. participate in a supply chain financing program under which they securitize their accounts receivables from Tenneco. The financial institution that participates in the supply chain financing program does so on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from Tenneco's suppliers at any time. If the  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

financial institution did not continue to purchase receivables from Tenneco's suppliers under this program, the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with Tenneco which in turn would cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase. 
  Capital Requirements.   We believe that cash flows from operations, combined with our cash on hand, subject to any applicable withholding taxes upon repatriation of cash balances from our foreign operations where most of our cash balances are located, and available borrowing capacity described above, assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of our senior credit facility agreement, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements, including debt amortization, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and other operational requirements, for the following year. Our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. In the event that we are unable to meet these financial covenants, we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs. Such actions include additional restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions, sales of assets, reductions to working capital and capital spending, issuance of equity and other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position. Should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs, we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  When foreign currency exchange rate risk cannot be managed by operational strategies, we use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans and accounts receivable and payable in nonfunctional currencies made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Additionally, we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. We manage counter-party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
  In managing our foreign currency exposures, we identify and then hedge exposures by creating offsetting intercompany exposures or through third-party derivative contracts. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset position of $1 million at   September 30, 2016   and is based on an internally developed model which incorporates observable inputs including quoted spot rates, forward exchange rates and discounted future expected cash flows utilizing market interest rates with similar quality and maturity characteristics. The following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts for our foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of   September 30, 2016  . All contracts in the following table mature in 2016. 

Interest Rate Risk 
  Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities. We use our revolving credit facility to finance our short-term and long-term capital requirements. We pay a current market rate  
  
   60 

     Table of Contents  

of interest on these borrowings. Our long-term capital requirements have been financed with long-term debt with original maturity dates ranging from five to ten years. On   September 30, 2016  , we had $743 million in long-term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates. Of that amount, $500 million is fixed through July 2026, $225 million is fixed through December 2024, and the remainder is fixed from 2016 through 2025. We also have $584 million in long-term debt obligations that are subject to variable interest rates. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Capitalization  earlier in this Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
  We estimate that the fair value of our long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   was about 101 percent of its book value. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates related to our variable interest rate debt would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about $7 million.

  Note 7 in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements located in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein for reference. 
  We expect to continue to incur legal and related costs in 2016 pertaining to the ongoing antitrust investigation. Such costs may not be evenly distributed throughout the year. 
   
  Tenneco 401(K) Retirement Savings Plan 
  Effective January 1, 2012, the Tenneco Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Hourly Employees and the Tenneco Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Salaried Employees were merged into one plan called the Tenneco 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the  Retirement Savings Plan ). Under the plan, subject to limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, participants may elect to defer up to 75 percent of their salary through contributions to the plan, which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock. We match 100 percent of an employee's contributions up to three percent of the employee's salary and 50 percent of an employee's contributions that are between three percent and five percent of the employee's salary. In connection with freezing the defined benefit pension plans for nearly all U.S. based salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December 31, 2006, and the related replacement of those defined benefit plans with defined contribution plans, we are making additional contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan. We recorded expense for these contributions of approximately $21 million and $20 million for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Matching contributions vest immediately. Defined benefit replacement contributions fully vest on the employee s third anniversary of employment.

  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
   
  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
  We are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Except for the update of the following risk factor, there have been no other material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  We are subject to, and could be further subject to, investigations by antitrust regulators and related lawsuits by other third parties.  Developments in these investigations and related lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern our business both in the United States and internationally, including antitrust laws. Violations of antitrust laws can result in significant penalties being imposed by antitrust authorities.  Costs, charges and liabilities arising out of or related to these investigations and related lawsuits can also be significant. 
  Antitrust authorities in various jurisdictions are investigating possible violations of antitrust laws by multiple automotive parts suppliers, including Tenneco. In addition, Tenneco and certain of its competitors are currently subject to civil putative class action lawsuits in the U.S., which allege anti-competitive conduct related to the activities subject to these investigations. More related lawsuits may be filed, including in other jurisdictions. Antitrust law investigations and related lawsuits often continue for several years and can result in significant penalties and liability.  At this point, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact on our company from investigations into our antitrust compliance and related lawsuits. In light of the uncertainties and many variables involved in such investigations and related lawsuits, we cannot assure you that the ultimate resolution of these and other investigations and related lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  (a) None. 
  (b) Not applicable. 
  (c) Purchase of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers.   The following table provides information relating to our purchase of shares of our common stock in the third quarter of   2016  . These purchases reflect shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock for minimum tax withholding obligations as well as shares repurchased through our share repurchase program. We generally intend to continue to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of outstanding restricted stock through the withholding of shares. 
  In January 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing our company to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock over a three year period. This repurchase program does not obligate Tenneco to make repurchases at any specific time or situation and is part of our overall capital allocation strategy. In October 2015, our Board of Directors expanded our company's share repurchase plan, authorizing the repurchase of an additional $200 million of our company's outstanding common stock. This authorization is in addition to the $350 million share repurchase program our company announced in January 2015. We repurchased   2.8 million   shares for   $146 million   through this program in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Since we announced the current share repurchase program in January 2015, we have repurchased   7.0 million   shares for   $359 million   through   September 30, 2016   and anticipate completing the remaining share repurchase authorization of $191 million by the end of 2017.

EXHIBIT 10.3 
  TENNECO INC. 2006 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT 

Participant 
    
  Effective as of ______________ (the  Grant Date ), the Participant has been granted a Full Value Award under the Tenneco Inc.  2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) in the form of shares of restricted stock with respect to ______ shares of Common Stock ( Restricted Shares ).  The Award shall be subject to the following terms and conditions (sometimes referred to as this  Award Agreement ) and the terms and conditions of the Plan as the same may be amended from time to time.  Terms used in this Award Agreement are defined elsewhere in this Award Agreement; provided, however, that, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.  
  1.  Vesting and Forfeiture of Restricted Shares  .  All Restricted Shares shall be unvested unless and until they become vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with this Paragraph 1.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement and the Plan, one-third (1/3) of the Restricted Shares awarded hereunder shall vest on each of the first, second and third anniversary of the Grant Date     (each a  Vesting Date ), provided that the Participant is continuously employed by the Company or a Subsidiary through the applicable Vesting Date.   Notwithstanding the foregoing: 
           (a) 
    in the event that (i) either (1) the Participant satisfies the requirements for Retirement or Total Disability (each as defined below) or (2) a tax withholding obligation is incurred under local law with respect to any of the Restricted Shares, in either case, prior to the Vesting Date with respect to such Restricted Shares (the date on which the requirements of clause (i)(1) or (i)(2) are satisfied being referred to herein as the  Tax Vesting Date ) and (ii) the Participant elects to satisfy the tax withholding obligation arising on the Tax Vesting Date pursuant to subparagraph 3(c) of this Award Agreement, then, on the Tax Vesting Date, that number of Restricted Shares having a Fair Market Value (determined as of the Tax Vesting Date) equal to the amount of taxes required to be withheld pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph 3(c) with respect to all Restricted Shares for which the Vesting Date has not occurred prior to the Tax Vesting Date shall become vested and the Tax Vesting Date shall be treated as the  Vesting Date  with respect to such shares; and  
              (b) 
    if the Participant's Termination Date occurs by reason of Total Disability, Retirement or death, any unvested Restricted Shares that are outstanding on the Termination Date shall vest immediately on the Termination Date and the Termination Date shall be the  Vesting Date  for purposes of this Award Agreement.  

All Restricted Shares which are not vested upon the Participant s Termination Date shall immediately expire and shall be forfeited and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Shares.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, the term  Total Disability means the Participant s permanent and total disability as determined under the rules and guidelines established by the Company in order to qualify for long-term disability coverage under the Company s long-term disability plan in effect at the time of such determination and the term  Retirement  means the Participant s Termination Date which occurs after the Participant has (I) attained age 65 or (II) attained age 55 and completed 10 years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and is not a result of termination by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for cause).  Any Restricted Shares for which the Tax Vesting Date is the Vesting Date (as determined in accordance with this Paragraph 1) shall be treated as attributable to successive tranches of Restricted Shares for which a Vesting Date has not occurred as of the Tax Vesting Date (and shall reduce the number of Restricted Shares in applicable tranches that will otherwise vest on future applicable Vesting Dates), beginning with the tranche of Restricted Shares with the first Vesting Date that occurs after the Tax Vesting Date.  Upon the Vesting Date with respect to any Restricted Shares, shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to the number of Restricted Shares which become vested on that Vesting Date will be delivered to the Participant (or his or her beneficiary), subject to withholding for taxes. 
  2.        Restrictions Prior to Vesting  .  Prior to the Vesting Date with respect to the Restricted Shares and until all conditions imposed on the Restricted Shares are satisfied, such Restricted Shares are restricted in that (a) they will be held by the Company and may not be sold, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, tendered or exchanged, or disposed of, by the Participant unless otherwise provided by the Plan and (b) they are subject to forfeiture by the Participant under certain circumstances as described herein and in the Plan.  However, as long as the applicable Restricted Shares are outstanding and have not been forfeited (i) the Participant will be entitled to receive, subject to withholding for taxes, dividends payable on the Restricted Shares, which the Committee or the Company may require to be reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Shares on which such dividends are paid and (ii) the Participant may vote the Restricted Shares.  The Participant agrees that the Restricted Shares (including any shares of Common Stock described in clause (ii)) shall be held by the Company prior to the Vesting Date with respect thereto. 
  3.        Withholding  .  All distributions under the Plan, including any distribution in respect of this Award, are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the delivery of any shares or other benefits under the Plan or this Award is conditioned on satisfaction of the applicable tax withholding obligations.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, such withholding obligations may be satisfied, at the Participant s election, (a) through cash payment by the Participant, (b) through the surrender of shares of Common Stock which the Participant already owns, or (c) through the surrender of shares of Common Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan; provided, however, that (i) the amount withheld in the form of shares of Common Stock under this Paragraph 3 may not exceed the minimum statutory withholding obligation (based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal and state purposes, including, without limitation, payroll taxes) unless otherwise elected by the Participant, (ii) in no event shall the Participant be permitted to elect less than the minimum  
  
   2 

statutory withholding obligation, and (iii) in no event shall the Participant be permitted to elect to have an amount withheld in the form of shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 3 that exceeds the maximum individual tax rate for the employee in applicable jurisdictions.  If the Participant makes an election in accordance with Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed on the Restricted Shares in the year in which the Grant Date occurs, he or she must so notify the Company in writing, file the election with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the Grant Date, and promptly pay the Company the amount it determines is needed to satisfy tax withholding requirements. 
  4.        Administration  .  The authority to manage and control the operation and administration of this Award shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all powers with respect to the Award and this Award Agreement as it has with respect to the Plan.  Any interpretation of the Award or this Award Agreement by the Committee and any decision made by it with respect to the Award or the Award Agreement is final and binding on all persons. 
  5.        Adjustment of Award  .  The number of Restricted Shares awarded pursuant to this Award Agreement may be adjusted by the Committee in accordance with the terms of the Plan to reflect certain corporate transactions which affect the number, type or value of the Restricted Shares.  The Participant agrees that the term Restricted Shares shall include any shares or other securities which the Participant may receive or be entitled to receive as a result of the ownership of the original Restricted Shares, whether they are issued as a result of a share split, share dividend, recapitalization, or other subdivision or consolidation of shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company or the result of the merger or consolidation of the Company, or sale of assets of the Company.  
  6.        Notices  .  Any notice required or permitted under this Award Agreement shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or when deposited in a United States Post Office, postage prepaid, addressed, as appropriate, to the Committee or the Company at the Company s principal offices, to the Participant at the Participant s address as last known by the Company or, in any case, such other address as one party may designate in writing to the other. 
  7.        Governing Law  .  The validity, construction and effect of this Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois and applicable federal law. 
  8.        Amendments  .  The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, and the Committee may amend this Award Agreement, provided that, except as provided in the Plan, no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under this Award Agreement prior to the date such amendment or termination is adopted by the Board or the Committee, as the case may be.     
  9.        Award Not Contract of Employment  .  The Award does not constitute a contract of employment or continued service, and the grant of the Award will not give the Participant the right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary, nor any right or  
  
   3 

claim to any benefit under the Plan or this Award Agreement, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.   
  10.        Severability  .  If a provision of this Award Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will nonetheless be enforceable according to their terms.  Further, if any provision is held to be overbroad as written, that provision shall be amended to narrow its application to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and enforced as amended. 
  11.        Plan Governs  .  The Award evidenced by this Award Agreement is granted pursuant to the Plan, and the shares of Restricted Stock and this Award Agreement are in all respects governed by the Plan and subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof, whether such terms and provisions are incorporated in this Award Agreement by reference or are expressly cited. 
  12.        Counterparts  . This Award Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

EXHIBIT 10.4 
  TENNECO INC. THREE YEAR 
  LONG TERM PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
  (______-______Performance Period) 
    
  ______________________ 
  Participant 
    
  Effective as of ______________, the Participant has been granted a Cash Incentive Award (the  Award ) under the Tenneco Inc.  2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) in the form of long term performance units ( Performance Units ).  The Award shall be subject to the following terms and conditions (sometimes referred to as this  Award Agreement ) and the terms and conditions of the Plan as the same may be amended from time to time.  Terms used in this Award Agreement are defined elsewhere in this Award Agreement; provided, however, that capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.  
  1.  General Terms of the Award  .  The following terms and conditions apply to the Award: 
  Performance Period:            January 1, 201__ to December 31, 201__ 
    
  Target Value of Award:        $                         (the  Total Target Value ) 
    
  Earning of Award:     
  50% based on Relative TSR performance  
  30% based on Cumulative EBITDA performance 
  20% based on Cumulative FCF performance 
    
  Appendix A of this Award Agreement, which is incorporated herein and forms a part of this Award Agreement, sets forth the manner in which TSR performance, EBITDA performance and FCF performance are calculated for purposes of this Award Agreement for the Performance Period. 
    
  2.        Earning of Award  .  The Participant will earn the Award based on satisfaction of performance targets as determined in accordance with the following: 
           (a) 
    TSR Target Value  .  For purposes hereof, the Participant s  TSR Target Value  is 50% of his or her Total Target Value.  The extent to which the Participant will earn his or her TSR Target Value is based on the Company TSR Percentile Ranking (calculated as described in Appendix A) for the Performance Period based on the following chart: 

(b) 
    EBITDA Target Value  .  For purposes hereof, the Participant s  EBITDA Target Value  is 30% of his or her Total Target Value.  The extent to which the Participant will earn his or her or her EBITDA Target Value is based on the Cumulative EBITDA (calculated as described in Appendix A) for the Performance Period against the Cumulative EBITDA Target established by the Committee for the Performance Period based on the following chart: 

(c) 
    FCF Target     Value.    For purposes hereof, the Participant s    FCF Target Value    is 20% of his or her Total Target Value.  The extent to which the Participant will earn his or her FCF Target Value is based on the achievement by the Company of Cumulative FCF (calculated as described in Appendix A) for the Performance Period against the Cumulative FCF Target established by the Committee for the Performance Period based on the following chart: 

(d) 
    Interpolation.    Interpolation shall be used to determine the Percent of TSR Target Value Earned, the Percent of EBITDA Target Value Earned and/or the Percent of FCF Target Value Earned, as applicable, in the event the Company TSR Percentile Ranking, Percent of EBITDA Target Value Earned and/or Percent of FCF Target Value Earned, as applicable, does not fall directly on one of the ranks listed in the above applicable charts.   
     3.        Form and Timing of Payments Under Award  . 
  
   2 

(a) 
    The payment of amounts earned as calculated pursuant to Paragraph 2 of this Award Agreement shall be paid to the Participant following the end of the Performance Period and no later   than two and one-half months after the end of the Performance Period.  Payment of such amounts shall be made subject to the following: 
              (i) 
    The Participant shall have no right with respect to any payments or other amounts in respect of this Award until such payments of amounts are actually paid or otherwise delivered to the Participant. 
              (ii) 
    If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant at any time has willfully engaged in any activity that the Committee determines was or is harmful to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any unpaid portion of the Award will be forfeited and the Participant shall have no rights with respect thereto. 
              (iii) 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein other than Paragraph 4 hereof (subject, however, to any applicable provisions of any written employment agreement between the Participant and the Company and the provisions hereof related thereto), if the Participant s Termination Date occurs on or before the end of the Performance Period other than as a result of Retirement, death or Total Disability, the Participant will forfeit this Award and shall have no rights with respect thereto. 
              (b) 
    Amounts earned as calculated pursuant to Paragraph 2 of this Award Agreement shall be paid out to the Participant in cash; provided, however, that, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may elect to settle the Award in shares of Common Stock based on the Fair Market Value of shares of Common Stock at the time of payment.  
     4.        Death, Total Disability and Retirement  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any written employment agreement between the Company and the Participant, if the Participant s Termination Date occurs on or before the end of the Performance Period (a) as a result of the Participant s death or Total Disability (as defined below), the Participant will be entitled to a payment equal to 100% of the Total Target Value assigned to the Participant under this Award, which amount shall be paid to the Participant, in cash, within 60 days after the date of the Participant s death or termination for Total Disability, or (b) as a result of Retirement (as defined below), the Participant will be entitled to a payment equal to the payment that he or she would have earned under this Award Agreement had the Participant continued to be employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries through the end of the Performance Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of the Participant s employment during the Performance Period prior to his or her Retirement and the denominator of which is the number of full months in the Performance Period, which amount shall be paid to the Participant, in cash, at the time determined under Paragraph 3.  For purposes hereof, the term "Retirement" means the Participant s Termination Date which occurs after the date on which he or she attains age 65 or the date on which the  
  
   3 

Participant attains age 55 and has completed at least 10 years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and is not a result of termination by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for cause), and the term "Total Disability" means the Participant s permanent and total disability as determined under the rules and guidelines established by the Company in order to qualify for long-term disability coverage under the Company's long-term disability plan in effect at the time of such determination.   
  5.        Payment of Fair Market Value in Certain Cases  .   If the Participant is entitled to receive payment for the fair market value of this Award pursuant to Article 6 of the Plan (relating to Change in Control), that fair market value will be equal to the amount the Participant would have received hereunder as if (a) his or her service had continued through the end of the Performance Period and (b) he or she had earned 100% of his or her Total Target Value.   
  6.        Withholding  .  All distributions under the Plan, including any distribution in respect of this Award, are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the delivery of any cash or other benefits under the Plan or this Award is conditioned on satisfaction of the applicable tax withholding obligations.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, such withholding obligations may be satisfied, at the Participant s election, (a) through cash payment by the Participant, (b) through the surrender of shares of Common Stock which the Participant already owns, or (c) through the surrender of shares of Common Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan; provided, however, that (i) the amount withheld in the form of shares of Common Stock under this Paragraph 6 may not exceed the minimum statutory withholding obligation (based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal and state purposes, including, without limitation, payroll taxes) unless otherwise elected by the Participant, (ii) in no event shall the Participant be permitted to elect less than the minimum statutory withholding obligation, and (iii) in no event shall the Participant be permitted to elect to have an amount withheld in the form of shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Paragraph 6 that exceeds the maximum individual tax rate for the employee in applicable jurisdictions. 
  7.        Transferability  .  This Award is not transferable except as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.   
  8.        Heirs and Successors  .  If any benefits deliverable to the Participant under this Award Agreement have not been delivered at the time of the Participant s death, such rights shall be delivered to the Participant s estate.  
  9.        Administration  .  The authority to administer and interpret this Award Agreement shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all the powers with respect to this Award Agreement as it has with respect to the Plan.  Any interpretation of the Award Agreement by the Committee and any decision made by it with respect to the Award Agreement is final and binding on all persons. 
  10.        Adjustment of Award  .   This Award may be adjusted by the Committee in accordance with the terms of the Plan to reflect certain corporate transactions which affect the number, type or value of the Performance Share Units.  
  
   4 

11.        Notices  .  Any notice required or permitted under this Award Agreement shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or when deposited in a United States Post Office, postage prepaid, addressed, as appropriate, to the Company at its principal offices, to the Participant at the Participant s address as last known by the Company or, in either case, such other address as one party may designate in writing to the other. 
  12.        Governing Law  .  The validity, construction and effect of this Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois and applicable federal law. 
  13.        Amendments  .  The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, and the Committee may amend this Award Agreement, provided that, except as provided in the Plan, no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under this Award Agreement prior to the date such amendment or termination is adopted by the Board or the Committee, as the case may be.       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee may amend or terminate this Award at any time in its sole discretion to exercise downward discretion in the amount payable under this Award if the Committee determines that the payout yielded or that would be yielded by this Award for the Performance Period does not accurately reflect the Company's performance for the Performance Period because the payout is too great.   
  14.        Award Not Contract of Employment  .  The Award does not constitute a contract of employment or continued service, and the grant of the Award will not give the Participant the right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary, nor any right or claim to any benefit under the Plan or this Award Agreement, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.   
  15.        Severability  .  If a provision of this Award Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions will nonetheless be enforceable according to their terms.  Further, if any provision is held to be overbroad as written, that provision shall be amended to narrow its application to the extent necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and enforced as amended. 
  16.        Plan Governs/Other Terms  .  The Award evidenced by this Award Agreement is granted pursuant to the Plan, and the Performance Units and this Award Agreement are in all respects governed by the Plan and subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof, whether such terms and provisions are incorporated in this Award Agreement by reference or are expressly cited.  Additionally, all Awards are subject to the Company s recoupment or clawback policies as applicable and as in effect from time to time. 
  17.        Counterparts  . This Award Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 
  
   5 

18.        Special Section 409A Rules  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Agreement to the contrary, if any payment or benefit hereunder is subject to section 409A of the Code, and if such payment or benefit is to be paid or provided on account of the Participant s termination of employment (or other separation from service): 
           (a)

APPENDIX A 
    
  DEFINITIONS AND CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES 
    
  Calculation of TSR  .   
    
                    TSR  
    = 
    Change in Stock Price + Dividends Paid 

Beginning Stock Price 

(i) 
    Beginning Stock Price shall mean the average of the Closing Prices for each of the twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to the first day of the Performance Period;  
              (ii) 
    Ending Stock Price shall mean the average of Closing Prices for each of the last twenty (20) trading days of the Performance Period;  
              (iii) 
    Change in Stock Price shall equal the Ending Stock Price minus the Beginning Stock Price;  
              (iv) 
    Dividends Paid shall mean the total of all dividends paid on one (1) share of stock during the Performance Period, provided that dividends shall be treated as though they are reinvested;  
              (v) 
    Closing Price shall mean the last reported sale price on the applicable stock exchange or market of one share of stock for a particular trading day; and 
              (vi) 
    In all events, TSR shall be adjusted to give effect to any stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits and similar transactions. 
     Calculation of Company TSR Percentile Ranking  . 
  The Company TSR Percentile Ranking is computed by (A) computing the Company s TSR for the Performance Period and (b) computing the TSR for the Performance Period of each company that was in the S P 500 Index as of the end of the Performance Period (the  S P Group ), provided that if a company declares bankruptcy at any time during the Performance Period, the company will be removed from the S P Group, and if a company does not have publicly reported stock prices for the whole Performance Period, the company will be removed from the S P Group.   The Company TSR Percentile Ranking is the percentage of TSRs of the S P Group calculated that are lower than the Company s TSR (e.g., if the Company s TSR is greater than 75% of the TSRs of the members of the S P Group, the Company TSR Percentile Ranking is the 75   th    percentile).   

Calculation of Cumulative EBITDA  .      
           (i) 
    The Company s Cumulative EBITDA means the sum of the Company s EBITDA for each of the three fiscal years included in the Performance Period.  
              (ii) 
    EBITDA means the Company s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncontrolling interests, adjusted for (a) asset write-downs, (b) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, (d) accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs, (e) extraordinary nonrecurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company s annual report to stockholders for the applicable year, and (f) acquisitions or divestitures. 
     Calculation of Cumulative FCF  .   
           (i) 
    The Company s Cumulative FCF means the sum of the Company s FCF for each of the three fiscal years included in the Performance Period.  
              (ii) 
    FCF means divisional cash flow less cash interest payments, net cash tax payments and distributions to non-controlling interest partners, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

  TO:      [Name of Individual] 
           RE: 
    Amendment to Outstanding Restricted Stock and Long Term Performance Unit ( LTPU ) Award Agreements 
     You are receiving this notice because you are the holder of Restricted Stock Awards and/or LTPU Awards granted under the Tenneco Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  LTIP ).  Recently, there were some changes in the accounting rules applicable to equity-based compensation that permitted us to amend the LTIP and outstanding awards to make the tax withholding provisions more flexible for participants.  
    
  Before the changes in the rules, the LTIP and the applicable award agreements provided that, except as provided by the committee that administers the LTIP (the  Committee ), participants could elect to satisfy required tax withholding through the surrender of previously-owned shares or through the surrender of shares to which the participant was otherwise entitled pursuant to the award (sometimes called  net  share withholding).  For accounting reasons, however, the LTIP (and award agreements) provided that any share withholding was limited to withholding at the minimum statutory withholding rate.  Due to the changes in the accounting rules, participants can now be permitted to elect share withholding up to the maximum individual tax rate for the employee s tax jurisdiction.   
    
  Both the LTIP and outstanding Restricted Stock Awards and LTPU Awards were amended to permit withholding in accordance with the new accounting rules.  In particular, your applicable award agreements have been amended to provide that, except as provided by the Committee, (i) the amount withheld in the form of shares of Tenneco stock may not exceed the minimum statutory withholding obligation (unless you elect otherwise), (ii) you will not be permitted to elect less than the minimum statutory withholding obligation, and (iii) you will be permitted to elect to have an amount withheld in the form of Tenneco stock that does not exceed your maximum individual tax rate.   
    
  This notice documents the amendment to your applicable award agreements.  You will not be receiving new award agreements.  Therefore, you should keep a copy of this notice with the applicable award agreements for your records.  
    
  If you have any questions, please contact ____________________.
