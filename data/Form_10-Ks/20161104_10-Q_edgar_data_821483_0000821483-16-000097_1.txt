Note 1 Overview    
    Par Pacific Holdings, Inc.   and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Par" or the "Company") own, manage and maintain interests in energy and infrastructure businesses. Currently, we operate in   three   primary business segments:  
  1)   Refining   - Our refinery in Kapolei, Hawaii produces ultra-low sulfur diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, marine fuel and other associated refined products primarily for consumption in Hawaii. Our refinery in   Newcastle, Wyoming   produces gasoline, ultra-low sulfur diesel, jet fuel and other associated refined products that are primarily marketed in Wyoming and South Dakota. 
  2)   Retail   - Our retail outlets sell gasoline, diesel and retail merchandise throughout the island of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii and Kauai. Our retail network includes "Hele," Tesoro and "76" branded retail sites, unmanned cardlock stations, company-operated convenience stores, sites operated in cooperation with 7-Eleven and other sites operated by third parties. We recently completed the rebranding of 30 out of 97 gas stations in Hawaii to "Hele," a new proprietary brand. 
  3)   Logistics   - We own and operate terminals, pipelines, a single-point mooring ("SPM") and trucking operations to distribute refined products throughout the island of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii, Molokai and Kauai. We own and operate a crude oil pipeline gathering system and related storage facilities in Wyoming and a refined products pipeline that transports product from our Wyoming refinery to a common carrier with access to Rapid City, South Dakota. Our Wyoming operations also include storage, loading racks and a rail siding at the refinery site. We also own and operate a jet fuel storage facility and pipeline that serve the Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. 
  We also own a   42.3%   equity investment in   Laramie Energy, LLC   ("  Laramie Energy  "). Laramie Energy develops and produces primarily natural gas, with operations and assets concentrated in the Piceance and Mancos Basins in Western Colorado.  
  In addition to the   three   operating segments described above, we have   two   additional reportable segments: (i)   Texadian   and (ii) Corporate and Other.   Texadian   focuses on sourcing, marketing, transporting and distributing crude oil and refined products in the United States ("U.S.") and Canada. Corporate and Other includes administrative costs and several small non-operated oil and gas interests that were owned by our predecessor. 

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts previously reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report include all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the complete fiscal year or for any other period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Use of Estimates        
  The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  For the Interim Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Deferred Turnaround Costs 
    
  Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at our refineries, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated until the next planned turnaround (generally   three   to   five years  ). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized deferred turnaround costs of approximately   $35.0 million  . Deferred turnaround costs are presented within Other long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    There have been no developments to recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for the following: 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations   ( ASU 2016-08 ). This ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ("ASU 2016-10"). This ASU amends the guidance on identifying performance obligations and the implementation guidance on licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting (SEC Update)   ("ASU 2016-11"). The amendments in ASU 2016-11 rescind certain SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, effective upon adoption of Topic 606. In addition, as a result of the amendments in ASU 2014-16, the SEC staff is rescinding its SEC Staff Announcement,  Determining the Nature of a Host Contract Related to a Hybrid Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share under Topic 815,  effective concurrently with Update 2014-16. In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ("ASU 2016-12"). The amendments in this ASU improve guidance on assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes, noncash consideration and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The effective dates for these ASUs are the same as the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and the impact this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ("ASU 2016-07"). ASU 2016-07 simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity method (as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence), the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the equity method would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee. ASU 2016-07 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-07 to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and requires that adjustments be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of adoption. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and the impact this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13"). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented as the net amount expected to be collected, which includes a reduction for any expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are to be estimated based on relevant information about past events and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The amendments are effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption

permitted for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"). The primary purpose of this ASU is to reduce the diversity in practice relating to eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The guidance in this ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied using a retrospective transition method. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  Note 3 Investment in Laramie Energy, LLC 
  We have a   42.3%   ownership interest in   Laramie Energy  , a joint venture entity focused on developing and producing natural gas in Garfield, Mesa and Rio Blanco Counties, Colorado.   Laramie Energy   has a   $400 million   revolving credit facility secured by a lien on its natural gas and oil properties and related assets with a borrowing base currently set at   $170 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility was approximately   $114 million  . We are guarantors of   Laramie Energy  's credit facility, with recourse limited to the pledge of our equity interest of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Par Piceance Energy Equity, LLC. Under the terms of its credit facility,   Laramie Energy   is generally prohibited from making future cash distributions to its owners, including us. 
  On   March 1, 2016  ,   Laramie Energy   acquired and assumed operatorship of certain properties in the Piceance Basin for  $157.5 million  , subject to customary purchase price adjustments ("Laramie Purchase"). In connection with the Laramie Purchase, we acquired additional membership interests of Laramie Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of   $55 million  . As a result of this transaction, our ownership interest in   Laramie Energy   increased from   32.4%   to   42.3%  . 
  The change in our equity investment in   Laramie Energy   is as follows (in thousands):

  For the Interim Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The net income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes   $13.5 million   and   $34.1 million   of depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD A") expense and   $12.7 million   of unrealized   gain   and   $16.8 million   of unrealized loss on derivative instruments, respectively. The net   loss   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   includes   $7.5 million   and   $23.3 million   of DD A expense and   $0.7 million   and   $5.1 million   of unrealized   losses   on derivative instruments, respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our equity in the underlying net assets of   Laramie Energy   exceeded the carrying value of our investment by approximately   $70.3 million   and   $55.4 million  , respectively. This difference arose primarily due to an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity investment in Laramie Energy in 2015 and our recent increase in ownership. We attributed this difference to natural gas and crude oil properties and are amortizing the difference over   15 years   based on the estimated timing of production of proved reserves. 
   
  Note 4 Acquisitions    
  Wyoming Refining Company   Acquisition  
  On   June 14, 2016  , Par Wyoming, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Par, entered into a unit purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with   Black Elk Refining, LLC   to purchase all of the issued and outstanding units representing the membership interests in   Hermes Consolidated, LLC   (d/b/a   Wyoming Refining Company  ) and indirectly   Wyoming Refining Company   s wholly-owned subsidiary,   Wyoming Pipeline Company, LLC   (collectively,    Wyoming Refining   ) (the "  WRC Acquisition  ").   Wyoming Refining   owns and operates a refinery and related logistics assets in   Newcastle, Wyoming  . 
  On   July 14, 2016  , we completed the   WRC Acquisition   for cash consideration of   $209.4 million  , including a deposit of   $5 million   paid in June 2016 and assumed   $58.0 million   of debt. The consideration was paid with funds received from the issuance of our 2.50% convertible subordinated bridge notes (the "Bridge Notes"), cash on hand, which included the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of an aggregate of   $115 million   principal amount of 5.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the "  5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  ") and the issuance of a   $65 million   secured term loan by   Par Wyoming Holdings, LLC   (the "  Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement  "). Please read   Note 9 Debt   for further information on the Bridge Notes, the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   and the   Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement  . 
  We accounted for the   WRC Acquisition   as a business combination whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. Goodwill recognized in the transaction was attributable to opportunities expected to arise from combining our operations with   Wyoming Refining   and utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards, as well as other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. 
  A summary of the preliminary estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the   WRC Acquisition   is as follows (in thousands):   

______________________________________________  
  (1) We allocated   $41.6 million   and   $21.7 million   of goodwill to our refining and logistics segments, respectively. 
  (2) We allocated   $295.9 million   and   $71.7 million   of total assets to our refining and logistics segments, respectively.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  For the Interim Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

We have recorded a preliminary estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and expect to finalize the purchase price allocation during 2017. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to income taxes and environmental liabilities. 
  The results of operations of Wyoming Refining were included in our results beginning   July 14, 2016  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our results of operations included revenues of   $83.9 million   and   net income   of   $1.4 million   related to Wyoming Refining. The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our consolidated revenues and net income (loss) as if the   WRC Acquisition   had been completed on January 1, 2015 (in thousands): 

Mid Pac Acquisition 
  On   April 1, 2015  , we completed the acquisition of Par Hawaii Inc., a Hawaii corporation ("PHI," formerly Koko oha Investments, Inc.), which owns   100%   of the outstanding membership interests in Mid Pac Petroleum, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (   Mid Pac   ). Net cash consideration was   $74.4 million  , including a working capital settlement of   $1.0 million   paid in September 2015. In connection with the acquisition,   Mid Pac  's pre-existing debt was fully repaid on the closing date for   $45.3 million  . The acquisition and debt repayment were funded with cash on hand and   $55 million   of borrowings under a Credit Agreement with the Bank of Hawaii ("  Mid Pac   Credit Agreement"). 
  We accounted for the acquisition of Mid Pac as a business combination whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. Goodwill recognized in the transaction was attributable to opportunities expected to arise from combining our operations with   Mid Pac  's and utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards, as well as other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. In addition, we recorded certain other identifiable intangible assets including trade names and customer relationships. These intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, which approximates their consumptive life. 
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the purchase price allocation was adjusted to record an increase to tax receivables and a decrease to goodwill of approximately   $0.6 million  . The tax receivable of   $0.6 million   relates to periods prior to the   Mid Pac   acquisition and was recorded in connection with a tax refund received by   Mid Pac   in March 2016. We finalized the   Mid Pac   acquisition purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2016. 
  The results of operations of Mid Pac were included in our refining, retail and logistics results beginning   April 1, 2015  .

  Supply and Offtake Agreements 
  On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron   Company ("J. Aron") to support the operations of our Hawaii refinery (the "Supply and Offtake Agreements"). The Supply and Offtake Agreements have a term of   three   years with   two     one  -year extension options upon mutual agreement of the parties. 
  During the term of the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we and J. Aron will identify mutually acceptable contracts for the purchase of crude oil from third parties. Per the Supply and Offtake Agreements, J. Aron will provide up to   94 thousand   barrels per day of crude oil to our Hawaii refinery. Additionally, we agreed to sell and J. Aron agreed to buy, at market prices, refined products produced at our Hawaii refinery. We will then repurchase the refined products from J. Aron prior to selling the refined products to our retail operations or to third parties. The agreements also provide for the lease of crude oil and certain refined product storage facilities to J. Aron. Following expiration or termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we are obligated to purchase the crude oil and refined product inventories then owned by J. Aron and located at the leased storage facilities at then-current market prices. Our obligations under the Supply and Offtake Agreements are secured by a security interest on substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary Par Hawaii Refining, LLC ("PHR"), a security interest on the equity interests held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Par Petroleum, LLC, in PHR and a mortgage whereby PHR granted to J. Aron a lien on all real property and improvements owned by PHR, including our Hawaii refinery. 
  While title to the crude oil and certain refined product inventories will reside with J. Aron, the Supply and Offtake Agreements will be accounted for similar to a product financing arrangement; therefore, the crude oil and refined products inventories will continue to be included on our condensed consolidated balance sheet until processed and sold to a third party. Each reporting period, we record a liability in an amount equal to the amount we expect to pay to repurchase the inventory held by J. Aron based on current market prices. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred approximately   $1.7 million   and   $5.6 million   in handling fees related to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, respectively, which is included in   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred approximately   $2.8 million   and   $4.0 million   in handling fees related to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, respectively, which is included in   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   Interest expense and financing costs, net   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations includes approximately   $0.9 million   and   $2.2 million   of expenses related to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   Interest expense and financing costs, net   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations includes approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.9 million   of expenses related to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, respectively. 
  The Supply and Offtake Agreements also include a deferred payment arrangement ("Deferred Payment Arrangement") whereby we can defer payments owed under the agreements up to the lesser of   $125 million   or   85%   of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Upon execution of the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we paid J. Aron a deferral arrangement fee of   $1.3 million  . The deferred amounts under the Deferred Payment Arrangement will bear interest at a rate equal to   90  -day LIBOR plus   3.75%   per annum. We also agreed to pay a deferred payment availability fee equal to   0.75%   of the unused capacity under the Deferred Payment Arrangement. Amounts outstanding under the Deferred Payment Arrangement are included in   Obligations under inventory financing agreements   on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the amount outstanding under the Deferred Payment Arrangement are included within Cash flows from financing activities on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , the capacity of the Deferred Payment Arrangement was   $63.5 million   and we had   $62.0 million   outstanding. 
  Under the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we pay or receive certain fees from J. Aron based on changes in market prices over time. In September 2015, we entered into an agreement to fix this market fee for the period from October 1, 2015 through November 30, 2016 whereby J. Aron agreed to pay us a total of   $18 million   to be settled in   fourteen   equal monthly payments. In February 2016, we fixed the market fee for the remainder of the term of the Supply and Offtake Agreements for an additional   $14.6 million   to be settled in   eighteen   equal monthly payments. The receivable from J. Aron was recorded as a reduction to our Obligations under inventory financing agreements pursuant to our Master Netting Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the   receivable   was   $18.5 million  . 
  The agreements also provide us with the ability to economically hedge price risk on our inventories and crude oil purchases. Please read   Note 10 Derivatives   for further information.

Supply and Exchange Agreements 
   On September 25, 2013, we entered into several agreements with Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), referred to collectively as the Supply and Exchange Agreements, for the purpose of managing our working capital and the crude oil and refined product inventory at the Hawaii refinery. Effective July 31, 2014, we supplemented the Supply and Exchange Agreements by entering into the Refined Product Supply Master Confirmation, pursuant to which Barclays provided refined product supply and intermediation arrangements to us.  
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred approximately   $6.9 million   in handling fees related to the Supply and Exchange Agreements, which is included in   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We incurred no handling fees related to the Supply and Exchange Agreements during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    Interest expense and financing costs, net   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations included approximately   $2.3 million   of interest expense related to the Supply and Exchange Agreements for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . We incurred   no   interest expense related to the Supply and Exchange Agreements during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Upon execution of the Supply and Offtake Agreements,   PHR   terminated the Supply and Exchange Agreements with Barclays, subject to certain obligations to reimburse Barclays for third-party claims. We recognized a loss of   $17.4 million   on the termination of the agreements which consisted of a loss of   $13.3 million   for the cash settlement value of the liability that had previously been measured assuming settlement with inventory on hand and a loss of   $5.6 million   for the acceleration of deferred financing costs. These losses were partially offset by a   $1.5 million   exit fee received from Barclays. The net loss of   $17.4 million   related to the termination of the Supply and Exchange Agreements is included in   Loss on termination of financing agreements   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The cash paid to settle the obligation is included in   Payments for termination of supply and exchange agreements   in the   Cash flows from financing activities   section of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement 
  On   July 14, 2016  , in connection with the   WRC Acquisition  , Par Wyoming Holdings, LLC, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the   Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement   with Chambers Energy Management, LP, which provides for a single advance secured term loan to our subsidiary in the amount of   $65.0 million   (the "  Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan  ") at the closing of the   WRC Acquisition  . The proceeds of the   Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan   were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the   WRC Acquisition   and to pay certain fees and closing costs. The   Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan   matures and is fully payable on   July 14, 2021   and may be prepaid, subject to the terms and requirements set forth in the   Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement  . 
  Interest is payable entirely in cash or, at our election with respect to any fiscal quarter, entirely paid-in-kind ("PIK"), provided that we may not elect to pay interest in the form of PIK for more than twelve fiscal quarters in the aggregate. The   Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan   will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable interest margin. With respect to cash interest, the applicable interest margin is at a rate per annum equal to   9.5%  . With respect to PIK interest, the applicable interest margin is at a rate per annum equal to   13%  .

The   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities   provide for (a) a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount at any time outstanding of   $30 million   ("  Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Revolver  "), subject to a borrowing base, which provides for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit and (b) certain term loans that are fully advanced ("  Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Term Loan  "). Once repaid, the   Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Term Loan   may not be reborrowed. The   Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Term Loan   bears interest at a rate equal to monthly LIBOR plus   3.0%  . Interest is payable in arrears on a monthly basis. The   Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Term Loan   requires quarterly principal payments of   $2.3 million   and the remaining unpaid balance is due at maturity. On   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the   Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Term Loan   was approximately   $58.0 million   and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of revolving loans and letter of credit obligations under the   Wyoming Refining Senior Secured Revolver   was approximately   $16.6 million  . 
  The   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities   require our subsidiaries and the borrowers under the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities   to comply with various affirmative, negative and financial covenants affecting their respective businesses, including certain financial covenants tested on a monthly basis, beginning July 31, 2016, through December 31, 2016, and quarterly thereafter. Included in these financial covenants are (1) a leverage ratio of not greater than   3.00   to 1.00 calculated on an annualized basis for each month ending on or before December 31, 2016 and on a trailing twelve-month basis for each fiscal quarter thereafter and (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio calculated as of the end of each month ending on or before December 31, 2016 and as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter. The fixed charge coverage ratio requires a ratio of at least   1.25   to 1.00. 
  The leverage ratio is determined as follows: 

Pursuant to the Third Loan Amendment, we made a deposit of   $10 million   into a cash collateral account with BofA (the "Cash Collateral") as a security for the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities  . The Cash Collateral will be released to Par upon meeting certain financial covenants and other requirements. The Cash Collateral of   $10 million   is included within   Restricted cash   on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . All loans and letters of credit issued under the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities   are secured by the Cash Collateral and a first-priority security interest and lien on substantially all assets of the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facility Borrowers  . 
  Bridge Notes 
  On   July 14, 2016  , we issued approximately   $52.6 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Notes in a private offering pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) entered into among the purchasers of the Bridge Notes and us. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bridge Notes of   $50 million   were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the   WRC Acquisition  . 
  Affiliates of EGI, a related party, purchased approximately   $36.8 million   aggregate principal amount of Bridge Notes. Affiliates of EGI were paid a fee of   $1.8 million   upon the closing of the Bridge Notes offering for executing the Bridge Notes Commitment Letter. Please read   Note 18 Related Party Transactions   for further discussion. 
  On   September 22, 2016  , we completed a registered pro-rata subscription rights offering of approximately   4 million   shares of our common stock (the  Rights Offering ). The Rights Offering resulted in gross proceeds, before expenses, of approximately   $49.9 million  . We used the net proceeds from the Rights Offering to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on the Bridge Notes. The remaining   $3.1 million   aggregate principal amount and   $0.3 million   unpaid interest of the Bridge Notes was mandatorily converted into   272,733   shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of   $12.25   per share. In connection with our repayment of the Bridge Notes, we expensed   $3.0 million   of financing costs, which are included within   Interest expense and financing costs, net   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

5% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2021 
  On June 21, 2016 and June 27, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate   $115 million   principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   in a private placement under Rule 144A (the "Notes Offering"). The Notes Offering included the exercise in full of an option to purchase an additional   $15 million   in aggregate principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   granted to the initial purchasers. The net proceeds of   $111.6 million   (net of original issue discount of 3%) from the sale of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   were used to finance a portion of the   WRC Acquisition  , to repay   $5 million   in principal amount of the Term Loan and for general corporate purposes. 
  The   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   bear interest at a rate of   5.00%   per year beginning   June 21, 2016   (payable semi-annually in arrears on   June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2016  ) and will mature on   June 15, 2021  . The initial conversion rate for the notes is   55.5556   shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   (or a total amount of   6,388,894   shares), which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $18.00   per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. Conversions of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   will be settled in cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof at our election. The holders of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   may exercise their conversion rights at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date under certain circumstances. 
  The   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   are not redeemable by us prior to   June 20, 2019  . On or after   June 20, 2019  , we may redeem all or any portion of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   if the last reported sales price of our common stock is at least   140%   of the conversion price then in effect (i) on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption and (ii) for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any   30   consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium, which is equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   to be redeemed from the relevant redemption date to the maturity date of   June 15, 2021  . We have determined that the redemption option and the related make-whole premium represent an embedded derivative that is not clearly and closely related to the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . Please read   Note 10 Derivatives   for further information on embedded derivatives. 
  We separately account for the liability and equity components of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . The fair value of the liability component was calculated using a discount rate of an identical debt instrument without a conversion feature. Based on this borrowing rate, the fair value of the liability component of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   on the issuance date was   $89.3 million  . The carrying amount of the equity component was determined to be   $22.2 million   by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the   $111.6 million   net proceeds of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . The deferred financing costs of   $0.6 million   related to   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   were allocated on a proportionate basis between Long-term debt and Additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of   September 30, 2016  , the if-converted value did not exceed the outstanding principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   was   $115.0 million  , the unamortized discount and deferred financing cost was   $25.0 million   and the carrying amount of the liability component was   $90.0 million  . The unamortized discount and deferred financing costs will be amortized to   Interest expense and financing costs, net   over the term of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . 
    
  Term Loan 
  On   June 15, 2016  , the Delayed Draw Term Loan and Bridge Loan Credit Agreement was amended to permit (i) the issuance of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  , (ii) the issuance of our Bridge Notes and (iii) the   WRC Acquisition  . We paid a consent fee of   $2.5 million   in connection with this amendment,   $1.3 million   of which was paid to an affiliate of Whitebox Advisors, LLC ("Whitebox"), one of our largest stockholders. On   June 21, 2016  , we repaid   $5 million   of the Term Loan pursuant to the terms of the amendment,   $3.3 million   of which was allocated to an affiliate of Whitebox.

  Note 10 Derivatives 
  Commodity Derivatives 
   We utilize crude oil commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil and future sales of refined products. The derivative contracts that we execute to manage our price risk include exchange traded futures, options and over-the-counter ( OTC ) swaps. Our futures, options and OTC swaps are marked-to-market and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized within   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  We are obligated to repurchase the crude oil and refined products from J. Aron at the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements. We have determined that this obligation contains an embedded derivative, similar to forward purchase contracts of crude oil and refined products. As such, we have accounted for this embedded derivative at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We are also required under the Supply and Offtake Agreements to hedge the time spread between the period of crude oil cargo pricing and the month of delivery. We utilize OTC swaps to accomplish this. 
  We have entered into forward purchase contracts for crude oil and forward sales contracts of refined products. We elect the   normal purchases normal sales     ("NPNS")   exception for all forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative and are not expected to net settle. Any gains and losses with respect to these forward contracts designated as   NPNS   are not reflected in earnings until the delivery occurs. 
  We elect to offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. Our condensed consolidated balance sheets present derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. Please read   Note 11 Fair Value Measurements   for the gross fair value and net carrying value of our derivative instruments. Our cash margin that is required as collateral deposits cannot be offset against the fair value of open contracts except in the event of default.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , our open commodity derivative contracts represent: 
             
    futures and OTC swaps sales of   634 thousand   barrels that economically hedge our crude oil and refined products inventory; 
                
    futures sales of   85 thousand   barrels that economically hedge our physical inventory for our Texadian segment; and 
                
    option collars of   52 thousand   barrels per month through   December 2017   and option collars and OTC swaps of   20 thousand   barrels per month through   December 2018   that economically hedge our internally consumed fuel. 
     Interest Rate Derivatives 
  We are exposed to interest rate volatility in our outstanding debt and in the Supply and Offtake Agreements. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had locked in an average fixed rate of   1.1%   in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR on an aggregate notional amount of   $200 million  . The interest rate swaps mature in February 2019 and March 2021. 
  On June 21, 2016 and June 27, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of   $115 million   principal amount of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . Please read   Note 9 Debt   for further discussion. Upon redemption of our   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   on or after   June 20, 2019   at our election, we are obligated to pay a make-whole premium equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   to be redeemed from the relevant redemption date to the maturity date of June 15, 2021. We have determined that the redemption option and the related make-whole premium represent an embedded derivative that is not clearly and closely related to the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . As such, we have accounted for this embedded derivative at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in   Interest expense and financing costs, net   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , this embedded derivative was deemed to have a   de minimis   fair value.

  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    
  Common Stock Warrants 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   354,350   and   345,135   common stock warrants outstanding, respectively. Beginning with the first quarter 2016, we estimate the fair value of our outstanding common stock warrants using the difference between the strike price of the warrant and the market price of our common stock, which is a Level 3 fair value measurement. Previously, we estimated the fair value of our outstanding common stock warrants using a simulation model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs used in the simulation model as of December 31, 2015 include:  

The expected volatility is based on the   7  -year historical volatilities of comparable public companies. The estimated fair value of the common stock warrants was   $13.04   and   $23.47   per share as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Since the common stock warrants were in the money upon issuance, we do not believe that changes in the inputs to the simulation models will have a significant impact to the value of the common stock warrants other than changes in the value of our common stock. Increases in the value of our common stock will increase the value of the common stock warrants. Likewise, decreases in the value of our common stock will result in a decrease in the value of the common stock warrants. 
  Derivative Instruments  
   We utilize crude oil commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil and future sales of refined products. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk. Please read   Note 10 Derivatives   for further information on derivatives.  
  We are obligated to repurchase the crude oil and refined products from J. Aron at the termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements. We have determined that this obligation contains an embedded derivative, similar to forward purchase contracts of crude oil and refined products. As such, we have accounted for this embedded derivative at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Upon redemption of our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes on or after   June 20, 2019   at our election, we are obligated to pay a make-whole premium equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the 5% Convertible Senior Notes to be redeemed from the relevant redemption date to the maturity date of June 15, 2021. We have determined that the redemption option and the related make-whole premium represent an embedded derivative that is not clearly and closely related to the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , this embedded derivative was deemed to have a   de minimis   fair value.  
  We classify financial assets and liabilities according to the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 instruments are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. These include our exchange traded futures.  Level 2 instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Our Level 2 instruments include OTC swaps and options.  These commodity derivatives are valued using market quotations from independent price reporting agencies and commodity exchange price curves that are corroborated with market data. Level 3 instruments are valued using significant unobservable inputs that are not supported by sufficient market activity. The J.Aron repurchase obligation derivative is a Level 3 instrument. 
  Contingent Consideration 
  The cash consideration for our acquisition of PHR may be increased pursuant to an earnout provision. The liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period using an estimate based on actual results to date and a Monte Carlo simulation analysis for future periods. Significant inputs used in the valuation model include estimated future gross margin, annual gross margin volatility and a present value factor. We consider this to be a Level 3 fair value measurement.

    Fair value approximates carrying value due to the floating rate interest which approximates a current market rate. 
              (3) 
    The carrying value of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   excludes the fair value of the equity component, which was classified as equity upon issuance.  
     We estimate the fair value of the Term Loan using a discounted cash flow analysis and an estimate of the current yield of   11.05%   and   9.63%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, by reference to market interest rates for term debt of comparable companies. 
  The fair value of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   was determined by aggregating the fair value of the liability and equity components of the notes. The fair value of the liability component of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis in which the projected interest and principal payments were discounted at an estimated market yield for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The equity component was estimated based on the Black-Scholes formula for a call option with strike price equal to the conversion price, a term matching the remaining life of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  , and an implied volatility based on market values of options outstanding as of September 30, 2016. The fair value of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   is considered a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy.

  Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies    
  In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits and other contingent matters. We establish accruals for specific legal matters when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Mid Pac Earnout and Indemnity Dispute 
  Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 3, 2011 and amended October 25, 2011 (the  SPA ), Mid Pac purchased all the issued and outstanding stock of Inter Island Petroleum, Inc. ( Inter Island ) from Brian J. and Wendy Barbata (collectively, the  Barbatas ).  The SPA provides for an earnout payment to be made to the Barbatas in an amount equal to   four   times the amount by which the average of Inter Island s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the relevant earnout period exceeds   $3.5 million  . The earnout payment is capped at a maximum of   $4.5 million  . Mid Pac contends that there are no amounts owed to the Barbatas for the earnout period. By letter dated May 29, 2014, the Barbatas disputed Mid Pac s computation of the earnout without explanation of the amount they claim to be owed or refutation of Mid Pac s analysis. Mid Pac intends to vigorously oppose any such claims. 
  Any claims by the Barbatas may be offset by Mid Pac s claims for indemnification under the SPA.  By letters dated December 13, 2013 and April 25, 2014, Mid Pac has asserted indemnification claims against the Barbatas exceeding   $1 million   with respect to environmental losses arising from certain terminals operated by Inter Island and its subsidiaries. The Barbatas have disputed such claims. 
  United Steelworkers Union Dispute 
  A portion of our employees at the Hawaii refinery are represented by the United Steelworkers Union ( USW ). On March 23, 2015, the union ratified a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement. On January 13, 2016, the USW filed a claim against PHR before the United States National Labor Relations Board (the  NLRB ) alleging a refusal to bargain collectively and in good faith. On March 29, 2016, the NLRB deferred final determination on the USW charge to the grievance/arbitration process under the extant collective bargaining agreement. Arbitration has not yet been scheduled. PHR denies the USW s allegations and intends to vigorously defend itself in connection with such claim in the grievance/arbitration process and any subsequent proceeding before the NLRB. 
  Environmental Matters  
  Like other petroleum refiners and exploration and production companies, our operations are subject to extensive and periodically-changing federal and state environmental regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. 
  Periodically, we receive communications from various federal, state and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective actions for these asserted violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action. Except as disclosed below, we do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Wyoming refinery 
  Our Wyoming refinery is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders and settlement agreements involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late 1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the Wyoming refinery. The largest cost component arising from these various decrees relates to the investigation, monitoring and remediation of soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment contamination associated with the facility s historic operations. Investigative work by Wyoming Refining and negotiations with the relevant agencies as to remedial approaches remain ongoing on a number of aspects of the contamination, meaning that investigation, monitoring and remediation costs are not reasonably estimable for some elements of these efforts. Based on current information, however, preliminary estimates we have received for the well-understood components of these efforts suggest total response costs of approximately   $20.0 million  , approximately   one-third   of which we expect to incur in the next   5 years  , with the remainder being incurred over approximately   30 years  .  
  Additionally, we believe the Wyoming refinery will need to modify or close a series of wastewater impoundments in the next several years and replace those impoundments with a new wastewater treatment system. Based on preliminary information, reasonable estimates we have received suggest costs of approximately   $2.1 million   to modify or close the existing wastewater treatment ponds and approximately   $11.6 million   to design and construct a new wastewater treatment system. 
  Finally, among the various historic consent decrees, orders and settlement agreements into which Wyoming Refining has entered, there are several penalty orders associated with exceedances of permitted limits by the Wyoming refinery s wastewater discharges. Although the frequency of these exceedances appears to be declining over time, Wyoming Refining may become subject to new penalty enforcement action in the next several years, which could involve penalties in excess of   $100,000  . Moreover, in addition to the issues associated with the Wyoming refinery, certain product pipeline assets were acquired in the   WRC Acquisition  . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration ( PHMSA ) recently conducted an integrated inspection of the products pipeline with additional follow-up regarding integrity management planning and general operations and maintenance. Based on preliminary discussions with PHMSA following this inspection, the Wyoming refinery anticipates a civil penalty in excess of   $100,000  . In connection with our acquisition of, and commencement of operations at, the Wyoming refinery, findings of a past failure to comply with applicable environmental or pipeline safety laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties that could be in excess of   $100,000  , the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations. 
  Regulation of Greenhouse Gases 
    The   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency     ("EPA")   regulates greenhouse gases ("GHG") under the Clean Air Act. New construction or material expansions that meet certain GHG emissions thresholds will likely require that, among other things, a GHG permit be issued in accordance with the Clean Air Act regulations and we will be required in connection with such permitting to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce GHG emissions. 
  Furthermore, the   EPA   is currently developing refinery-specific GHG regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose GHG emission limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations. Any such controls could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business and an increase in cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
  On September 29, 2015, the   EPA   announced a final rule updating standards that control toxic air emissions from petroleum refineries, addressing, among other things, flaring operations, fenceline air quality monitoring and additional emission reductions from storage tanks and delayed coking units. Affected existing sources will be required to comply with the new requirements no later than 2018, with certain refiners required to comply earlier depending on the relevant provision and refinery construction date. We do not anticipate that compliance with this rule will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In 2007, the State of Hawaii passed Act 234, which required that GHG emissions be rolled back on a statewide basis to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Although delayed, the Hawaii Department of Health has issued regulations that would require each major facility to reduce CO   2    emissions by   16%   by 2020 relative to a calendar year 2010 baseline (the first year in which GHG emissions were reported to the   EPA   under 40 CFR Part 98). Those rules are pending final approval by the Government of Hawaii. The Hawaii refinery s capacity to reduce fuel use and GHG emissions is limited. However, the state s pending regulation allows and the Hawaii refinery expects to be able to demonstrate that additional reductions are not cost-effective or necessary in light of the state s current GHG inventory and future year projections. The pending regulation allows for  partnering  with other facilities

(principally power plants) which have already dramatically reduced greenhouse emissions or are on schedule to reduce CO   2    emissions in order to comply with the state s Renewable Portfolio Standards. 
  Fuel Standards 
  In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the "EISA") that, among other things, set a target fuel economy standard of   35   miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contained a second Renewable Fuel Standard (the  RFS2 ). In August 2012, the   EPA   and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish an average industry fuel economy of   54.5   miles per gallon by model year 2025. The RFS2 requires an increasing amount of renewable fuel usage, up to   36 billion   gallons by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. The RFS2 may present production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the   EPA   to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels.  
  In October 2010, the   EPA   issued a partial waiver decision under the Clean Air Act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from   10%   ( E10 ) to   15%   ( E15 ) for 2007 and newer light duty motor vehicles. In January 2011, the   EPA   issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model years 2001- 2006. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed on a large scale for use in traditional gasoline engines. Consequently, unless either the state or federal regulations are revised,   qualified Renewable Identification Numbers     ("RINs")   will be required to fulfill the federal mandate for renewable fuels.  
  In March 2014, the   EPA   published a final Tier 3 gasoline standard that lowers the allowable sulfur level in gasoline to 10 parts per million ("ppm") and also lowers the allowable benzene, aromatics and olefins content of gasoline, with the most recent rulemaking addressing certain technical corrections and clarifications effective June 21, 2016. The effective date for the new standard, January 1, 2017, gives refiners nationwide little time to engineer, permit and implement substantial modifications; however, approved small volume refineries have until January 1, 2020 to meet the standard. PHR submitted its application to the EPA for small volume refinery status on December 30, 2014 and the EPA approved the application on September 9, 2015. However, PHR exceeded the 75,000 barrel average aggregate daily crude oil throughput limit for small volume refineries in 2015 and was therefore disqualified from small volume refinery effective as of June 21, 2016. PHR is required to comply with Tier 3 gasoline standards within 30 months of this date. On March 19, 2015, the EPA confirmed the small refinery status of our Wyoming refinery. 
  There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in the EISA and other fuel-related regulations. Along with credit and trading options, potential capital upgrades for the Hawaii and Wyoming refineries are being evaluated. We may also experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. 
  Environmental Agreement 
  On   September 25, 2013  , Hawaii Pacific Energy (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Par created for purposes of the PHR acquisition), Tesoro Corporation ("Tesoro") and   PHR   entered into an Environmental Agreement ( Environmental Agreement ), which allocated responsibility for known and contingent environmental liabilities related to the acquisition of   PHR  , including the Consent Decree as described below.    
  Consent Decree 
  On July 18, 2016, PHR and subsidiaries of Tesoro entered into a consent decree with the EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice and other state governmental authorities concerning alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act related to the ownership and operation of multiple facilities owned or formerly owned by Tesoro and its affiliates ("Consent Decree"), including our Hawaii refinery. As a result of the Consent Decree, PHR expanded its previously-announced refinery turnaround completed during the third quarter of 2016 to undertake additional capital improvements to reduce emissions of air pollutants, to provide for certain nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission controls and monitoring and to install certain leak detection and repair equipment required by the Consent Decree. Although the turnaround was completed during the third quarter of 2016, work related to the Consent Decree remains ongoing. This work subjects us to risks associated with engineering, procurement and construction of improvements and repairs to our facilities and related penalties and fines to the extent applicable deadlines under the Consent Decree are not satisfied, as well as risks related to the performance of equipment required by, or affected by, the Consent Decree. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
  We estimate the cost of compliance with the Consent Decree to be approximately   $30 million  . However, Tesoro is responsible under the Environmental Agreement to reimburse PHR for all reasonable third party capital expenditures incurred for

the Consent Decree to the extent related to acts or omissions prior to the date of the closing of the PHR acquisition.  Tesoro is obligated to pay all applicable fines and penalties related to the Consent Decree. 
  As of September 30, 2016, Tesoro has reimbursed us for   $4.7 million   of the total capital expenditures of   $7.1 million   incurred in connection with the Consent Decree. Net capital expenditures and reimbursements related to the Consent Decree are presented within   Capital expenditures   on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Indemnification 
    In addition to its obligation to reimburse us for capital expenditures incurred pursuant to the Consent Decree, Tesoro agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses arising out of related breaches of Tesoro s representations, warranties and covenants in the Environmental Agreement, certain defined  corrective actions  relating to pre-existing environmental conditions, third-party claims arising under environmental laws for personal injury or property damage arising out of or relating to releases of hazardous materials that occurred prior to the date of the closing of the PHR acquisition, any fine, penalty or other cost assessed by a governmental authority in connection with violations of environmental laws by   PHR   prior to the date of the closing of the PHR acquisition, certain groundwater remediation work, fines or penalties imposed on   PHR   by the Consent Decree related to acts or omissions of Tesoro prior to the date of the closing of the PHR acquisition and to claims and losses related to the Pearl City Superfund Site.  
  Tesoro s indemnification obligations are subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Environmental Agreement. These limitations include a deductible of   $1 million   and a cap of   $15 million   for certain of Tesoro s indemnification obligations related to certain pre-existing conditions as well as certain restrictions regarding the time limits for submitting notice and supporting documentation for remediation actions. 
  Recovery Trusts    
  We emerged from the reorganization of Delta Petroleum on August 31, 2012 ("Emergence Date") when the plan of reorganization ("Plan") was consummated. On the Emergence Date, we formed the Delta Petroleum General Recovery Trust ( General Trust ). The General Trust was formed to pursue certain litigation against third parties, including preference actions, fraudulent transfer and conveyance actions, rights of setoff and other claims, or causes of action under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other claims and potential claims that the Debtors hold against third parties. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   two   related claims totaling approximately   $22.4 million   remained to be resolved by the trustee for the General Trust and we have reserved approximately   $0.6 million   representing the estimated value of claims remaining to be settled which are deemed probable and estimable at period end.  
  One of the two remaining claims was filed by the U.S. Government for approximately   $22.4 million   relating to ongoing litigation concerning a plugging and abandonment obligation in Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Lease OCS-P 0320, comprising part of the Sword Unit in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. The second unliquidated claim, which is related to the same plugging and abandonment obligation, was filed by Noble Energy Inc., the operator and majority interest owner of the Sword Unit. We believe the probability of issuing stock to satisfy the full claim amount is remote, as the obligations upon which such proof of claim is asserted are joint and several among all working interest owners and Delta, our predecessor, only owned an approximate   3.4%   aggregate working interest in the unit.  
  The settlement of claims is subject to ongoing litigation and we are unable to predict with certainty how many shares will be required to satisfy all claims. Pursuant to the Plan, allowed claims are settled at a ratio of   54.4   shares per $1,000 of claim.

  On   September 22, 2016  , we issued approximately   4 million   shares of our common stock to certain pre-existing investors and other investors in the Rights Offering at a purchase price of   $12.25   per share. The gross proceeds from the Rights Offering were approximately   $49.9 million  , before deducting expenses of approximately   $0.6 million  , for net proceeds of approximately   $49.3 million  . The net proceeds from the Rights Offering were used to repay all accrued and unpaid interest and a portion of the outstanding principal amount on the Bridge Notes.

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   89 thousand   and   242 thousand   shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units with a fair value of approximately   $1.2 million   and   $4.2 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   3 thousand   and   1.1 million   stock option awards with a weighted-average exercise price of   $15.15   and   $21.49   per share, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   $12.1 million   of total unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock option awards, which are expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of   2.8 years  . 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares issuable under the LTIP, subject to shareholder approval. Additionally, we issued an aggregate of   1.1 million   stock option awards to our new President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chairman and our Vice Chairman of our board of directors, each with an exercise price of   $21.44  . In the first quarter of 2016, we issued an aggregate of approximately   52 thousand   stock option awards with an exercise price of   $22.99   and approximately   34 thousand   shares of restricted stock to our Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and General Counsel and Senior Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions. These stock option and restricted stock awards were also subject to shareholder approval and therefore were not considered granted as of December 31, 2015. 
  On June 2, 2016, our shareholders approved an amendment to the LTIP to increase the number of shares issuable under the LTIP to   4 million   shares. Accordingly, the stock option and restricted stock awards issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 were considered granted as of June 2, 2016.

Note 14 Income (Loss) per Share    
  Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average number of shares issuable under the common stock warrants, representing   352 thousand   shares during each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   587 thousand   shares and   693 thousand   shares during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The common stock warrants are included in the calculation of basic income (loss) per share because they are issuable for minimal consideration. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

________________________________________________________  
           (1) 
    Entities with a net loss from continuing operations are prohibited from including potential common shares in the computation of diluted per share amounts. We have utilized the basic shares outstanding to calculate both basic and diluted loss per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Participating securities includes restricted stock that has been issued but has not yet vested. 
     For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excluded   463 thousand   and   448 thousand   shares of unvested restricted stock,   1.7 million   stock options and   6.4 million   and   2.3 million   outstanding common stock equivalents assuming our   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   had been converted on the date of issuance, respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our weighted-average potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding consisted of   587 thousand   and   303 thousand   shares of unvested restricted stock and   10 thousand   and   27 thousand   common stock equivalents related to stock options, respectively.  
  As discussed in   Note 9 Debt  , we have the option of settling the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   in cash or shares of common stock, or any combination thereof, upon conversion. We have a net loss for the period; therefore, there is no impact for the conversion of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   on diluted EPS as the effect would be anti-dilutive; however, had we reported net income for the   three   or   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , diluted EPS would have been determined using the if-converted method. 
   
  Note 15 Income Taxes    
  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future results of operations and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income, significant book losses during the current and prior periods and projections for future results of operations over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, among other factors, management continues to conclude that we did not meet the  more likely than not  requirement in order to recognize deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets at   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no adjustments were recognized for uncertain tax positions.

Our net taxable income must be apportioned to various states based upon the income tax laws of the states in which we derive our revenue. Our net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards will not always be available to offset taxable income apportioned to the various states. The states from which some of our revenues are derived are not the same states in which our NOLs were incurred; therefore we expect to incur state tax liabilities on the net income of our refining, logistics, retail and Texadian segments. 
  Pursuant to ASC 740-20-45-7, we recognize the interim effects of intraperiod tax allocation discretely. As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a benefit for the release of   $8.6 million   of our valuation allowance to offset future temporary differences associated with the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded a benefit for the release of   $18.3 million   of our valuation allowance as we expect to be able to utilize a portion of our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income of   PHI  .  Excluding the impact of releasing the tax valuation allowance in   2016   with respect to the issuance of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  , we recognized a state tax expense of   $1 thousand   and state tax benefit of   $17 thousand   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Excluding the impact of releasing the valuation allowance in   2015  , we recognized a state tax expense of   $174 thousand   and   $217 thousand   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  We will continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on consideration of actual and projected operating results and tax planning strategies. Should actual operating results continue to improve, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered more likely than not to be realizable could be increased. 
   
  Note 16 Benefit Plans    
  Wyoming Refining Defined Contribution Plan 
  Our Wyoming refinery has a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering substantially all its employees (the "Contribution Plan"). Employees are allowed to make contributions to the Contribution Plan and begin vesting in the Contribution Plan immediately upon employment. Company contributions vest at the rate of   20%   each year over a   five  -year period from the date of employment. We contribute up to   6%   of participants  base salary to the Contribution Plan.  
  Defined Benefit Plan  
  Our Wyoming refinery has a defined benefit pension plan (the "Benefit Plan") covering substantially all its employees. Benefits are based on years of service and the employee s highest average compensation received during five consecutive years of the last ten years of employment. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount equal to the pension expense, subject to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the tax deductibility of such contributions. The components of the underfunded status of the Benefit Plan as of the   WRC Acquisition   date of July 14, 2016 are as follows:

We have a long-term, risk-controlled investment approach using diversified investment options with minimal exposure to volatile investment options like derivatives. Our Benefit Plan assets are invested in pooled separate accounts administered by the Benefit Plan custodian. The underlying assets in the pooled separate accounts are invested in equity securities, debt securities and real estate. The pooled separate accounts are valued based upon the fair market value of the underlying investments and are deemed to be Level 2. 
  We do not intend to make any contributions to the pension plan during   2016  . Based on current data and assumptions, the following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid over the next   10 years  :

Note 17 Segment Information    
    During the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to separate our logistics operations from our refining operations due to a change in senior leadership, organizational structure, the acquisition of   Mid Pac   and to reflect how we currently make financial decisions and allocate resources. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we also began including all general and administrative and acquisition and integration expenses in our Corporate and Other segment because we manage those costs on a consolidated basis. Additionally, effective in the fourth quarter of 2015, the crude oil and natural gas operations are included within the Corporate and Other reportable segment. Currently we report the results for the following   five   business segments: (i)   Refining  , (ii)   Retail  , (iii)   Logistics  , (iv)   Texadian   and (v) Corporate and Other. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the results of operations of   Wyoming Refining   are included in our   refining   and   logistics   segments. 
  We previously reported results for the following   four   business segments: (i) Refining and Distribution, (ii) Retail, (iii) Natural Gas and Oil Production and (iv) Commodity Marketing and Logistics.

  Certain of our stockholders, or affiliates of our stockholders, are the lenders under our Term Loan. In previous years, they received common stock warrants exercisable for shares of common stock in connection with the origination of the Term Loan. On   June 15, 2016  , the Term Loan was amended to permit (i) the issuance of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  , (ii) the issuance of the Bridge Notes and (iii) the   WRC Acquisition  . We paid a consent fee of   $2.5 million   in connection with this amendment,   $1.25 million   of which was paid to an affiliate of Whitebox, one of our largest stockholders. On   June 21, 2016  , we repaid   $5 million   of the Term Loan pursuant to the terms of the amendment,   $3.3 million   of which was allocated to an affiliate of Whitebox. 
  Convertible Notes Offering 
    In June 2016, we issued   $115 million   in aggregate principal amount of our   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   in a private placement under Rule 144A in the Notes Offering. Please read   Note 9 Debt   for further discussion. 
  Prior to the Notes Offering, we also entered into a backstop convertible note commitment letter with funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC ("Highbridge") and funds managed on behalf of Whitebox (collectively, the  Backstop Convertible Note Purchasers ), pursuant to which the Backstop Convertible Note Purchasers committed to purchase   $100 million   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes due 2021, which would be issued in a private offering pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  
  The obligations of the Backstop Convertible Note Purchasers to purchase convertible notes automatically terminated upon the consummation of the Notes Offering, provided that each of the Back Up Convertible Note Purchasers and their respective affiliates were allocated the opportunity to purchase at least   $32.5 million   of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   offered in the Notes Offering.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  Overview 
  We are a growth-oriented company based in Houston, Texas focused on operating integrated refining, logistics and distribution businesses in niche markets. We also own, manage and maintain interests in other energy and infrastructure businesses. We were created through the successful reorganization of Delta Petroleum Corporation ("Delta") in August 2012. The reorganization converted approximately $  265 million   of unsecured debt to equity and allowed us to preserve significant tax attributes. We changed our name from Par Petroleum Corporation to   Par Pacific Holdings, Inc.   effective October 20, 2015.  
  Our business is organized into   three   primary operating segments:  
  1)   Refining   - Our refinery in Kapolei, Hawaii, produces ultra-low sulfur diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, marine fuel and other associated refined products primarily for consumption in Hawaii. Our refinery in   Newcastle, Wyoming  , produces gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, jet fuel and other associated refined products that are primarily marketed in Wyoming and South Dakota. 
  2)   Retail   - Our retail outlets sell gasoline, diesel and retail merchandise throughout the island of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii and Kauai. Our retail network includes "Hele," Tesoro and "76" branded retail sites, unmanned cardlock stations, company-operated convenience stores, sites operated in cooperation with 7-Eleven and other sites operated by third parties. We recently completed the rebranding of 30 out of 97 gas stations in Hawaii to a new proprietary brand called "Hele." 
  3)   Logistics   - We own and operate terminals, pipelines, a single-point mooring ("SPM") and trucking operations to distribute refined products throughout the island of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii, Molokai and Kauai. We own and operate a crude oil pipeline gathering system and related storage facilities in Wyoming and a refined products pipeline that transports product from our Wyoming refinery to a common carrier with access to Rapid City, South Dakota. Our Wyoming operations also include storage, loading racks and a rail siding at the refinery site. We also own and operate a jet fuel storage facility and pipeline that serve the Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. 
  We also own a   42.3%   equity investment in   Laramie Energy  . Laramie Energy develops and produces primarily natural gas, with operations and assets concentrated in the Piceance and Mancos Basins in Western Colorado.  
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our reportable segments to separate our logistics operations from our refining operations due to a change in senior leadership, organizational structure, the acquisition of   Par Hawaii, Inc.   ("  PHI  ") and to reflect how we currently make financial decisions and allocate resources. We have five reportable segments: (i)   Refining  , (ii)   Retail  , (iii)   Logistics  , (iv)   Texadian   and (v) Corporate and Other. We previously reported results for the following   four   business segments: (i) Refining and Distribution, (ii) Retail, (iii) Natural Gas and Oil Production and (iv) Commodity Marketing and Logistics. We have recast the segment information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to conform to the current period presentation. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the results of operations of   Wyoming Refining   are included in our   refining   and   logistics   segments. Please read   Note 17 Segment Information   to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for detailed information on our operating results by segment. 
  Recent Events 
  On   June 14, 2016  , we entered into a unit purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with   Black Elk Refining, LLC   to purchase all of the issued and outstanding units representing the membership interests in   Hermes Consolidated, LLC   (d/b/a   Wyoming Refining Company  ) and indirectly   Wyoming Refining Company   s wholly-owned subsidiary,   Wyoming Pipeline Company, LLC   (collectively,    Wyoming Refining   ) (the "  WRC Acquisition  ").   Wyoming Refining   owns and operates the   18,000   barrels per day refinery and related logistics assets in   Newcastle, Wyoming  . The   WRC Acquisition   closed on   July 14, 2016  . Please read   Note 4 Acquisitions   for further discussion. 
  
   32 

On   December 17, 2015  , we entered into an equity commitment letter with Laramie Energy, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase certain membership interests of Laramie Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of $  55 million   in connection with the closing of a purchase and sale agreement whereby Laramie Energy agreed to acquire certain properties in the Piceance Basin for   $157.5 million  , subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction closed on   March 1, 2016   and, upon the closing of the transaction, Laramie Energy assumed ownership and operatorship of the purchased properties and our ownership interest in Laramie Energy increased from   32.4%   to   42.3%  . 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we successfully restarted our Hawaii refinery after a major turnaround and a maintenance project on our subsea pipeline. The turnaround and pipeline maintenance, including associated downtime, reduced our profitability as a result of high feedstock costs driven by the purchase of higher-cost crude oil and the additional import of 8 thousand barrels per day in refined products, higher production costs per throughput barrel of   $5.42   during the third quarter of 2016 compared to   $4.18   during the third quarter of 2015, and   $4.9 million   in additional maintenance expense for the refinery and subsea pipeline during the third quarter of 2016. The total deferred costs related to the turnaround were   $35.0 million   and will be amortized over the period until the next turnaround. 

Results of Operations 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net Income (Loss).   Our   third   quarter   2016   results were impacted by the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery and poor global crack spreads, which is reflected in a decrease in our   net income   from   $14.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to a   net loss   of   $27.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . Other factors impacting our results period over period include the change in value of our contingent consideration obligation, a decrease in impairment expense and increases in DD A, equity earnings from Laramie, and interest expense and financing costs, net as further discussed below.  
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss).   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA was   a loss   of   $1.7 million   compared to   earnings   of   $34.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily related to higher production and maintenance costs associated with the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery and lower crack spreads, partially offset by improved crude oil differentials and the contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was a   loss   of   $19.0 million   when compared to   income   of   $23.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily related to higher production and maintenance costs associated with the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery, lower crack spreads and increases in DD A and interest expense and financing costs, net, partially offset by improved crude oil differentials, increase in equity earnings from Laramie, and the contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016. 
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015 
    Net Income (Loss).   During   2016  , our financial performance was impacted by the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery and poor global crack spreads, which is reflected in a decrease in our   net income   from   $26.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to a   net loss   of   $59.5 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . Other factors impacting our results period over period include the termination of certain financing agreements in 2015, the change in value of our contingent consideration obligation, a decrease in impairment expense, an increase in our equity losses from Laramie and the releases of valuation allowances as further discussed below.  
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss).   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of   $3.1 million   compared to   earnings   of   $87.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily related to higher production and maintenance costs associated with the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery and lower crack spreads, partially offset by improved crude oil differentials, the contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016, and the contribution provided by Mid Pac, which was acquired on   April 1, 2015  . 
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was   a loss   of   $60.5 million   compared to   income   of   $52.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily related to higher production and maintenance costs associated with the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery, lower crack spreads, and an increase in losses from Laramie Energy, partially offset by improved crude oil differentials, the contribution provided by Wyoming Refining, which was acquired on July 14, 2016, and the contribution provided by Mid Pac, which was acquired on   April 1, 2015  .

    Crude oil throughput and sales volumes per day is calculated based on the   79   day period for which we owned the Wyoming Refining in 2016.  As such, the amounts for the total refining segment represent the sum of the Hawaii refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over the respective period plus the Wyoming refinery's throughput or sales volumes averaged over for the period from July 14, 2016 to   September 30, 2016  .  
              (2) 
    The profitability of our Hawaii business is heavily influenced by crack spreads in both the Singapore and U.S. West Coast markets. These markets reflect the closest liquid market alternatives to source refined products for Hawaii. We believe the Singapore and Mid Pacific crack spreads (or four barrels of Brent crude converted into one barrel of gasoline, two barrels of distillate (diesel and jet fuel) and one barrel of fuel oil) best reflect a market indicator for our operations. The Mid Pacific crack spread is calculated using a ratio of 80% Singapore and 20% San Francisco indexes. 
              (3) 
    Weighted-average differentials, excluding shipping costs, of a blend of crudes with an API of 31.98 and sulfur weight percentage of 0.65% that is indicative of our typical crude oil mix quality compared to Brent crude. 
              (4) 
    Please see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total refining throughput.  
              (5) 
    Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refinery including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in   Operating expense (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations. 
              (6) 
    The profitability of our Wyoming refinery is heavily influenced by crack spreads in nearby markets. We believe the Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is the best market indicator for our operations in Wyoming. The Wyoming 3-2-1 Index is computed by taking two parts gasoline and one part distillate (ULSD) as created from three barrels of West Texas Intermediate Crude. Pricing is based 50% on applicable product pricing in Rapid City, South Dakota and 50% on applicable product pricing in Denver, Colorado.

As such, the amounts for the total logistics segment represent the sum of the pipeline throughput in Hawaii averaged over the respective period plus the pipeline throughput in Wyoming averaged over for the period from July 14, 2016 to   September 30, 2016  .  
      
  Non-GAAP Performance Measures    
  Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
  Adjusted Gross Margin 
  Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation and purchase price allocation adjustments) and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) less inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINS obligations and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin. 
  Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in   Operating expense (excluding depreciation)   and   Depreciation, depletion and amortization  . 
  Adjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost of revenues.

The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):   

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA  
  Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants, acquisition and integration expense, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, inventory valuation adjustment, loss on termination of financing agreements, impairment expense and release of tax valuation allowance. Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding interest, taxes, DD A and equity losses from Laramie Energy. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess: 
             
    The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; 
                
    The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and 
     
   40 

Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure. 
     Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.

  Factors Impacting Segment Results 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015 
  Refining.   Operating   loss   for our refining segment was   $18.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $53.2 million   compared to operating   income   of   $35.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in profitability was primarily driven by lower crack spreads and the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery. The 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific crack spread   decreased   from   $7.93   per barrel in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $4.45   per barrel in the   third   quarter of   2016  . The decrease in crack spreads was partially offset by improved crude oil differentials. The Mid Pacific crude oil differential   increased   from   $0.56   per barrel in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $2.42   per barrel in the   third   quarter of   2016  . The downtime associated with the turnaround resulted in higher production costs per throughput barrel of   $5.42   during the third quarter of 2016 compared to   $4.18   during the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, we imported 8 thousand barrels per day of refined products to meet customer demand during the turnaround which significantly contributed to our low margin realization during the third quarter. We also incurred approximately   $1.3 million   of repair and maintenance expenses incurred associated with the turnaround. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $3.7 million of operating income to the refining segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Logistics.   Operating   income   for our logistics segment was   $2.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $3.5 million   compared to operating   income   of   $6.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Profitability of the logistics business decreased primarily due to repair and maintenance expenses of   $3.6 million   related to the Hawaii subsea pipeline and a   decrease   in pipeline throughput in Hawaii from   139.3   Mbpd for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   128.8   Mbpd for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   driven by the Hawaii refinery turnaround. Wyoming Refining

contributed approximately $0.7 million of operating income to the logistics segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Retail.   Operating   income   for our retail segment was   $6.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $2.9 million   compared to operating   income   of   $9.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in operating income was primarily due to   a decrease   in sales prices of   9%   which caused a compression in margin as costs did not decrease at the same rate as sales prices. 
  Texadian.   Operating   loss   for our Texadian segment was   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   in profitability of   $12.7 million   compared to an operating   loss   of   $12.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to an impairment charge of   $9.6 million   related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and an overall decrease in activity. 
   
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015 
  Refining.   Operating   loss   for our refining segment was   $35.3 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $113.5 million   compared to operating   income   of   $78.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in profitability was primarily driven by lower crack spreads and the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery. The 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific crack spread   decreased   from   $8.93   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   $4.29   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in crack spreads was partially offset by improved crude oil differentials. The Mid Pacific crude oil differential   increased   from   $1.43   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   $2.19   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The downtime associated with the turnaround resulted in higher production costs per throughput barrel of   $3.96   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.80   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, we imported 8 thousand barrels per day of refined products to meet customer demand during the turnaround which significantly contributed to our low margin realization during the third quarter. We also incurred approximately $1.3 million of repair and maintenance expenses associated with the turnaround. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $3.7 million of operating income to the refining segment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Logistics.   Operating   income   for our logistics segment was   $13.0 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $6.9 million   compared to operating   income   of   $19.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in profitability is primarily due to repair and maintenance expenses of $3.6 million related to the Hawaii subsea pipeline and a   decrease   in pipeline throughput in Hawaii from   146.3   Mbpd for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   141.8   Mbpd for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   driven by the Hawaii refinery turnaround. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately $0.7 million of operating income to the logistics segment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Retail.   Operating   income   for our retail segment was   $17.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $4.8 million   compared to operating   income   of   $21.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in profitability was primarily due to   a decrease   in sales prices of   13%  . The   decrease   in sales prices was partially offset by the acquisition of Mid Pac on   April 1, 2015   which contributed   $9.7 million   of operating income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   to our retail segment as compared to   $6.4 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Texadian.   Operating   loss   for our Texadian segment was   $2.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   in profitability of   $9.4 million   compared to operating   loss   of   $11.5 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in profitability was primarily due to an impairment charge of   $9.6 million   related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Adjusted Gross Margin 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015 
  Refining.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately   $32.2 million  ,   a decrease   of   $24.1 million   compared to   $56.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to lower crack spreads and the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery. The 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific crack spread   decreased     44%   from   $7.93   per barrel during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $4.45   per barrel during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in crack spreads resulted in a decrease of approximately   $22.3 million   in Adjusted Gross Margin for the refining segment. The decrease was also due to high feedstock costs driven by the purchase of higher-cost crude oil and the additional import of 8 thousand barrels per day of refined products to meet customer demand during the turnaround. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately   $15.6 million   of Adjusted Gross Margin to the refining segment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   42 

Logistics.     For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately   $8.8 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.3 million   compared to   $8.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by the logistics segment of the   WRC Acquisition  , which contributed approximately $0.7 million of Adjusted Gross Margin to the logistics segment, partially offset by a decrease in pipeline throughput in Hawaii, which   decreased   from   139.3   Mbpd for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   128.8   Mpbd for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Retail.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately   $19.2 million  ,   a decrease   of   $1.6 million   when compared to   $20.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to   a decrease   of   9%   in sales prices which caused a compression in retail fuel margins (sales price of fuel charged to retail customers  at the pump  minus cost of fuel paid to our suppliers) as costs did not decrease at the same rate as prices. 
  Texadian.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our Texadian Adjusted Gross Margin was   a loss of approximately     $0.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.4 million   compared to   a loss of approximately     $1.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to an overall decrease in activity. 
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015 
  Refining.     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately   $80.9 million  ,   a decrease   of   $67.0 million   compared to   $147.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to lower crack spreads and the turnaround at our Hawaii refinery. The 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific crack spread   decreased     52%   from   $8.93   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   $4.29   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The   decrease   in crack spreads was partially offset by improved crude oil differentials. The Mid Pacific crude oil differential   increased     53%   from   $1.43   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   $2.19   per barrel for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was also due to high feedstock costs driven by the purchase of higher-cost crude oil and the additional import of 8 thousand barrels per day of refined products to meet customer demand during the turnaround. Wyoming Refining contributed approximately   $15.6 million   of Adjusted Gross Margin to the refining segment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Logistics.     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately   $25.0 million  ,   a decrease   of   $1.2 million   compared to   $26.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily driven by throughput in Hawaii, which   decreased   from   146.3   Mbpd for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   141.8   Mbpd for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Retail.     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately   $53.1 million  ,   an increase   of   $2.4 million   when compared to   $50.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was driven by a   19%   increase in sales volumes, which is primarily attributed to the acquisition of Mid Pac on   April 1, 2015  . This increase in volumes was offset by   a decrease   of   13%   in sales prices that caused a compression in retail fuel margins (sales price of fuel charged to retail customers  at the pump  minus cost of fuel paid to our suppliers) as costs did not decrease at the same rate as prices.  
  Texadian  .   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our Texadian Adjusted Gross Margin was   a loss of approximately     $4.8 million  ,   a decrease   of   $4.9 million   when compared to income of   approximately     $0.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to   lower   trading differentials on heavy Canadian crude oil and lower volumes as the Cushing/Hardisty trading differential   decreased   from   $5.73   per barrel in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   to   $4.02   per barrel in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .

Discussion of Consolidated Results 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , revenues were   $510.3 million  , a   $14.8 million     increase   compared to   $495.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to the   WRC Acquisition  , which closed on July 14, 2016, that contributed revenues of   $80.9 million   to the refining segment, offset by a decrease of   $66.7 million   in third-party revenues at our Hawaii refinery as a result of declines in crude oil prices. Brent crude oil prices averaged   $46.99   per barrel during the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to   $51.20   per barrel during the   third   quarter of 2015, with similar   decreases   in WTI crude oil prices. Revenues in our retail segment   decrease  d   $5.8 million   primarily driven by   a decrease   of   9%   in sales prices. 
  Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation).   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)  , was   $459.3 million  , a   $54.1 million     increase   compared to   $405.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by the   WRC Acquisition  , which closed on July 14, 2016, that contributed   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   of   $66.7 million   to the refining segment. Our   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   related to our Hawaii refinery decreased   $12.0 million   as a result of the global declines in crude oil prices (as discussed above). The decrease in crude oil prices was offset by high feedstock costs driven by the purchase of higher-cost crude oil and the additional import of 8 thousand barrels per day of refined products to meet customer demand during the turnaround. 
  Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation).     For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   operating expense (excluding depreciation)   was approximately   $51.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $13.2 million   when compared to   $38.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to higher repair and maintenance expenses of approximately $4.9 million related to the Hawaii subsea pipeline and the turnaround of our Hawaii refinery and an increase of approximately   $9.1 million   related to the   WRC Acquisition  , which closed on July 14, 2016. 
  Lease Operating Expense.     For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , lease operating expense was approximately   $10 thousand  ,   a decrease   of   $1.6 million   when compared to   $1.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to shutting in operations at the Point Arguello Unit in offshore California during the third quarter of 2015. 
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  .     For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , DD A expense was approximately   $9.6 million  ,   an increase   of   $5.0 million   compared to   $4.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to depreciation of assets acquired as part of the   WRC Acquisition   on   July 14, 2016   and amortization of deferred turnaround expenditures of $1.1 million associated with our Hawaii refinery turnaround during the third quarter of 2016. Wyoming Refining contributed   $3.1 million   of DD A expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    Impairment Expense.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded impairment charges of   $9.6 million   related to goodwill and intangible assets in our Texadian segment. There was no impairment expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  General and Administrative Expense.      For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expense was approximately   $9.9 million  , which was flat when compared to   $9.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Acquisition and Integration Expense.      For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , acquisition and integration expense was approximately   $2.0 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.7 million   when compared to   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was due to acquisition and integration expense of   $2.0 million   incurred in connection with the   WRC Acquisition   completed in   July 2016  . Additionally, during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred no expense related to the integration of Mid Pac, which was acquired on   April 1, 2015  , compared to   $0.3 million   of integration expense during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest Expense and Financing Costs, Net  .   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our interest expense and financing costs were approximately   $11.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $6.8 million   when compared to   $4.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to interest expense and financing costs of approximately $3.0 million related to the Bridge Notes, interest expense of $1.4 million associated with our   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   issued during the second quarter of 2016 and interest expense of $2.2 million related to the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities   and the   Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement  .

Change in Value of Common Stock Warrants  .   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in   a gain   of approximately   $0.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.7 million   when compared to   a loss   of approximately   $1.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our stock price decreased from   $15.34   per share as of   June 30, 2016   to   $13.08   per share as of   September 30, 2016  , which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , our stock price increased from   $18.72   per share as of   June 30, 2015   to   $20.83   per share as of   September 30, 2015  , which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the common stock warrants. 
  Change in Value of Contingent Consideration  .   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the change in value of our contingent consideration liability resulted in   income   of approximately   $1.0 million  , a change of   $5.3 million   when compared to   a loss   of   $4.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The contingent consideration relates to the acquisition of   PHR   that occurred on   September 25, 2013   and the change in value during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to a decrease in our expected cash flows related to   PHR   for 2016 as a result of lower crack spreads. 
  Equity Earnings (Losses) From Laramie Energy  .   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , equity   earnings   from Laramie were approximately   $3.7 million  ,   an increase   in equity   earnings   of   $5.1 million   compared to equity   losses   of   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in equity   earnings   was primarily due to an increase in derivative gains of $9.8 million in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   offset by an increase in DD A expense of $6 million. 
  Income Taxes.   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax   expense   of   $30 thousand  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded income tax   expense   of   $0.5 million   which includes a   $0.3 million   increase in the valuation allowance resulting from adjustments to the Mid Pac purchase price allocation and $0.2 million in state income tax expense. 
   
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015 
  Revenues.   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues were   $1.3 billion  , a   $0.3 billion     decrease   compared to   $1.6 billion   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to   reductions   of   $390.8 million   and   $21.0 million   in third-party revenues at our Hawaii refinery and Texadian, respectively, and was primarily the result of global declines in crude oil prices. Brent crude oil prices averaged   $43.18   per barrel in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $55.31   per barrel in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , with similar   decreases   experienced for WTI crude oil prices. Wyoming Refining contributed revenues of   $80.9 million   to the refining segment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . Revenues in our retail segment   increase  d   $6.9 million   primarily driven by the Mid Pac acquisition on   April 1, 2015   which contributed revenues for the retail segment of   $91.6 million   and   $63.5 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   increase   in retail revenues related to Mid Pac was partially offset by   a decrease   of   13%   in sales prices.  
  Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation).   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)  , was   $1.2 billion  , a   $0.2 billion     decrease   compared to   $1.4 billion   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to reductions of   $288.0 million   and   $38.7 million   at our Hawaii refinery and Texadian, respectively, and was primarily the result of global declines in crude oil prices as discussed above. The decrease in crude oil prices was offset by high feedstock costs driven by the purchase of higher-cost crude oil and the additional import of 8 thousand barrels per day in refined products. Wyoming Refining contributed   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   of   $66.7 million   to the refining segment.   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   in our retail segment increased   $4.4 million   primarily driven by the Mid Pac acquisition on   April 1, 2015  , which contributed   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   for the retail segment of   $67.6 million   and   $47.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in retail sales volumes related to Mid Pac was partially offset by a decrease of   14%   in the cost of refined product resulting from the global declines in crude oil prices as discussed above.  
  Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation).     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   operating expense (excluding depreciation)   was approximately   $125.2 million  ,   an increase   of   $22.4 million   compared to   $102.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to the acquisitions of Wyoming Refining and Mid Pac that contributed   $9.1 million   and   $7.0 million   to the increase in   operating expense (excluding depreciation)  , respectively. Additionally, we chartered a new barge in 2016 which increased   operating expense (excluding depreciation)   by $2.0 million and repair and maintenance expense increased   $4.9 million   in connection with the Hawaii subsea pipeline and the turnaround of our Hawaii refinery.  
  Lease Operating Expense.     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , lease operating expense was approximately   $0.1 million  ,   a decrease   of   $4.5 million   when compared to   $4.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to shutting in operations at the Point Arguello Unit in offshore California during the third quarter of 2015. 
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  .     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , DD A expense was approximately   $19.8 million  ,   an increase   of   $6.9 million   when compared to   $12.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to depreciation, depletion and amortization of assets acquired as part of the Wyoming Refining and Mid Pac acquisitions on   July 14, 2016   and   April 1, 2015  , respectively. Wyoming Refining contributed   $3.1 million   of DD A expense for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . Mid Pac contributed   $4.5 million   and   $2.6 million   of DD A expense for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Additionally, we recognized amortization of deferred turnaround expenditures of $1.1 million for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Impairment Expense.   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded impairment charges of   $9.6 million   related to goodwill and intangible assets in our Texadian segment. There was no impairment expense for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   45 

General and Administrative Expense.     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , general and administrative expense was approximately   $31.7 million  , which was relatively flat when compared to   $31.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Acquisition and Integration Expense.     For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , acquisition and integration expense was approximately   $3.6 million  ,   an increase   of   $1.8 million   when compared to   $1.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to the   WRC Acquisition   being completed in   July 2016  , partially offset by costs incurred for the Mid Pac acquisition and integration during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest Expense and Financing Costs, Net  .   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our interest expense and financing costs were approximately   $22.0 million  ,   an increase   of   $6.2 million   when compared to   $15.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to interest expense and financing costs of approximately $3.0 million related to the Bridge Notes, interest expense of $1.4 million associated with our   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes   issued during the second quarter of 2016 and interest expense of $2.2 million related to the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities   and the   Par Wyoming Holdings Credit Agreement  .  
  Change in Value of Common Stock Warrants  .   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a   gain   of approximately   $3.5 million  , a change of   $6.2 million   when compared to a   loss   of   $2.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our stock price   decreased   from   $23.54   per share as of   December 31, 2015   to   $13.08   per share as of   September 30, 2016   which resulted in   a decrease   in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , our stock price increased from   $16.25   per share on   December 31, 2014   to   $20.83   per share on   September 30, 2015   which resulted in an increase in the value of the common stock warrants. 
  Change in Value of Contingent Consideration  .   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the change in value of our contingent consideration liability resulted in a   gain   of approximately   $10.8 million  , a change of   $29.5 million   when compared to a   loss   of   $18.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The contingent consideration relates to the acquisition of PHR which occurred on   September 25, 2013   and the change in value was due to a decrease in our expected cash flows related to PHR for 2016 as a result of lower crack spreads. 
  Loss on Termination of Financing Agreements.   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , our loss on the termination of financing agreements was approximately   $19.2 million  , which includes a loss of   $17.4 million   on the termination of the Barclays Supply and Exchange Agreements and a loss of   $1.8 million   on the termination of the asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility with PHR (the "HIE ABL Facility"). The loss of   $17.4 million   on the termination of the Supply and Exchange Agreements consists of a loss of   $13.3 million   for the cash settlement value of the liability and a loss of   $5.6 million   for the acceleration of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a   $1.5 million   exit fee received from Barclays. The loss on the termination of the HIE ABL Facility consists of the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs. No such loss was incurred in the   2016   period. 
  Equity Losses From Laramie Energy  .   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , equity   losses   from Laramie were approximately   $15.2 million  ,   an increase   in the loss of   $9.1 million   compared to equity   losses   of   $6.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in the loss was primarily due to increases of $10.8 million and $10.9 million in DD A and   losses   on derivative instruments in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , respectively.  
  Income Taxes.   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax benefit of   $8.1 million   primarily due to the release of   $8.6 million   of our valuation allowance as we expect to be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with the reversal of the deferred tax liability recognized upon issuance of the   5.00% Convertible Senior Notes  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an income tax benefit of   $18.1 million   primarily due to the release of   $18.3 million   of our valuation allowance as we expect to be able to utilize a portion of our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income of Mid Pac.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements, fixed capacity payments and contractual obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements and access to capital markets. 
  
   46 

The following table summarizes our liquidity position as of   October 28, 2016   and   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

           (1) 
    Please read   Note 8 Inventory Financing Agreements   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
              (2) 
    Includes HIE Retail, LLC and Mid Pac, which are parties to the   Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities  . 
     The change in our liquidity position from   September 30, 2016   to   October 28, 2016   was primarily attributable to changes in working capital and results of operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had access to the J. Aron Deferred Payment Arrangement, the   Hawaii Retail Credit Facilities  , a   $30 million   revolving credit facility under the   Wyoming Refining Credit Facilities  , and cash on hand of   $56.3 million  . In addition, we have the Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron, which are used to finance the majority of the inventory at our Hawaii refinery. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our   refining   segment, our   retail   segment, our   Texadian   segment, payments related to acquisitions, and cash capital contributions to   Laramie Energy  . 
  We believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital expenditures, working capital and debt service requirements for the next 12 months. 
  We may seek to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. 
   
  Cash Flows  
    The following table summarizes cash activities for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):   

  Net cash   used in   operating activities was approximately   $41.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , which resulted from   a net loss   of approximately   $59.5 million  , non-cash   charges to   operations of approximately   $22.9 million   and net cash   used for   changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately   $4.7 million  , including deferred turnaround expenditures of   $35 million  . Net cash   provided by   operating activities was approximately   $144.3 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , which resulted from   net income   of approximately   $26.9 million  , non-cash   charges to   operations of approximately   $70.9 million   and net cash   provided by   changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately   $46.5 million  .  
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash   used in   investing activities was approximately   $291.1 million   and primarily related to   $209.2 million   for the acquisition of   Wyoming Refining Company  , an investment in   Laramie Energy   of  
  
   47 

$55.0 million   in connection with its acquisition of additional natural gas and oil properties and additions to property and equipment of approximately of   $19.3 million  . Net cash   used in   investing activities was approximately   $107.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   and primarily related to   $64.4 million   for the acquisition of   PHI  , an investment in   Laramie Energy   of   $27.5 million   and additions to property and equipment of approximately   $15.9 million  . 
  Net cash   provided by   financing activities for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $220.9 million   and consisted primarily of net proceeds from   borrowings   of approximately   $157.2 million  , net proceeds from the Rights Offering of   $49.3 million   and net proceeds from the J. Aron deferred payment arrangement of   $26.7 million  . These outflows were partially offset by a   $16.8 million   payment related to contingent consideration for the PHR acquisition,   $12.0 million   of which was classified as a financing activity. Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   was approximately   $24.0 million   and consisted primarily of net   repayments   on debt of   $29.2 million   and net repayments of the deferred payment arrangement of   $8.5 million  . These repayments were partially offset by net cash proceeds of   $13.2 million   due to the change in the inventory financing agreements from the Barclays Supply and Exchange Agreements to the J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreements.  
  Capital Expenditures  
  Our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   totaled approximately   $19.3 million   and were primarily related to our Hawaii refinery and information technology systems. We also funded   $55 million   for investments in   Laramie Energy  . Our capital expenditure budget for   2016  , including major maintenance costs, ranges from   $50 million   to   $55 million   and primarily relates to scheduled turnaround expenditures, as well as projects to improve our Hawaii refinery reliability and efficiency and upgrades to our information technology systems. In connection with the closing of the   WRC Acquisition  , we increased our capital expenditure budget for   2016   by approximately $11 million, which primarily relates to Wyoming refinery improvements to meet government regulations and upgrades to the information technology systems. 
  We also continue to seek strategic investments in business opportunities, but the amount and timing of those investments are not predictable. 
   
  Commitments and Contingencies  
  Point Arguello.   On March 23, 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation ( Whiting ), whereby we paid Whiting an aggregate of $3.9 million to transfer the entirety of our interest in the Point Arguello Unit offshore California ( Point Arguello ) to Whiting and to satisfy any and all obligations in respect of such interest in Point Arguello. 
  Supply and Offtake Agreements.   On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron   Company ("J. Aron") to support the operations of our Hawaii refinery (the "Supply and Offtake Agreements"). The Supply and Offtake Agreements have a term of three years with two one-year extension options upon mutual agreement of the parties. Please read   Note 8 Inventory Financing Agreements   for more information. 
  Consent Decree.   On July 18, 2016, PHR and subsidiaries of Tesoro entered into a consent decree with the EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice and other state governmental authorities concerning alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act related to the ownership and operation of multiple facilities owned or formerly owned by Tesoro and its affiliates ("Consent Decree"), including our Hawaii refinery. As a result of the Consent Decree, PHR expanded its previously-announced refinery turnaround to undertake additional capital improvements to reduce emissions of air pollutants, to provide for certain nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emission controls and monitoring and to install certain leak detection and repair equipment required by the Consent Decree. 
   We estimate the cost of compliance with the Consent Decree to be approximately $30 million. However, Tesoro is responsible under the Environmental Agreement to reimburse PHR for all reasonable third party capital expenditures incurred for the Consent Decree to the extent related to acts or omissions prior to the date of the closing of the PHR acquisition. Tesoro is obligated to pay all applicable fines and penalties related to the Consent Decree. Please read   Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies   for more information. 
  Wyoming refinery.   Our Wyoming refinery is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders and settlement agreements involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late 1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the Wyoming refinery. Please read   Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies   for more information.

  Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Commodity Price Risk  
  Our earnings, cash flow and liquidity are significantly affected by commodity price volatility. Our revenues fluctuate with refined product prices and our   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   fluctuates with movements in crude oil and feedstock prices. Assuming all other factors remain constant, a $1 per barrel change in average gross refining margins, based on our year-to-date throughput of   85 thousand   barrels per day, would change annualized operating income by approximately   $30.5 million  . This estimate may differ from actual results. 
  In order to manage commodity price risks, we utilize exchange-traded futures, options and OTC swaps to manage commodity price risks associated with: 
             
    the price for which we sell our refined products; 
                
    the price we pay for crude oil and other feedstocks; 
                
    our crude oil and refined products inventory; 
     
   49 

our fuel requirements for our Hawaii refinery; and 
                
    our exposure to crude oil price volatility in our Texadian segment. 
     Our Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron require us to hedge our exposure based on the time spread between the crude oil cargo pricing period and the expected delivery month. We manage this exposure by entering into swaps with J. Aron. Please read   Note 8 Inventory Financing Agreements   for more information. 
  All of our futures and OTC swaps are executed to economically hedge our physical commodity purchases, sales and inventory. Our open futures and OTC swaps expire at various dates through December 30, 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , these open commodity derivative contracts represent:  
             
    futures and OTC swaps sales of   634 thousand   barrels that economically hedge our crude oil and refined products inventory; and 
                
    futures sales of   85 thousand   barrels that economically hedge our physical inventory for our Texadian segment. 
       Based on our net open positions at   September 30, 2016  , a $1 change in the price of crude oil, assuming all other factors remain constant, would have an approximately $764 thousand effect on the fair value of these derivative instruments and   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)  . 
  Our predominant variable operating cost is the cost of fuel consumed in the refining process, which is included in   Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Assuming normal operating conditions, we consume approximately   71 thousand   barrels per day of crude oil during the refining process at our Hawaii refinery. We internally consume approximately 3% of this throughput in the refining process which is accounted for as a fuel cost. We have economically hedged our internally consumed fuel cost at our Hawaii refinery by purchasing option collars and swaps at a rate of   52 thousand   barrels per month through   December 2017   and   20 thousand   barrels per month through   December 2018  . These option collars have a weighted-average strike price ranging from a floor of   $53.17   per barrel to a ceiling of   $61.28   per barrel. The OTC swaps have a weighted-average price of   $46.45  . 
  Compliance Program Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of   qualified Renewable Identification Numbers     ("RINs")   required to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Our overall   RINs   obligation is based on a percentage of our domestic shipments of on-road fuels as established by the   EPA  . To the degree we are unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy our   RINs   obligation, we must purchase   RINs   on the open market. To mitigate the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may purchase   RINs   when the price of these instruments is deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments, however, we elect the   normal purchases normal sales   exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. 
  Interest Rate Risk  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $237.6 million   of outstanding debt was subject to floating interest rates. We also have interest rate exposure in connection with our liability under the J. Aron Supply and Offtake Agreements for which we pay a charge based on 3-month LIBOR. An increase of 1% in the variable rate on our indebtedness, after considering the instruments subject to minimum interest rates, would result in an increase to our   cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)   and interest expense of approximately   $1.9 million   and   $2.7 million   per year, respectively. 
  We utilize interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate collars or other similar contracts to manage our interest rate risk. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had locked in an average fixed rate of   1.1%   in exchange for a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR on an aggregate notional amount of   $200 million  . The interest rate swaps mature in February 2019 and March 2021. 
  Credit Risk 
  We are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. We will continue to closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with our credit policy.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , these disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and accumulated and reported to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There were no changes during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financing reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
  PHMSA Matters 
  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration ( PHMSA ) recently conducted an integrated inspection of the Wyoming refinery's products pipeline with additional follow-up regarding integrity management planning and general operations and maintenance. Based on preliminary discussions with PHMSA following this inspection, Wyoming Refining anticipates a civil penalty in excess of $100,000. In connection with our acquisition of, and commencement of operations at, the Wyoming refinery, findings of a past failure to comply with applicable environmental or pipeline safety laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties that could be in excess of $100,000, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations.  
  Kawaihae Loading Rack 
  On   October 9, 2014  , Mid Pac received a notice from the EPA alleging that Mid Pac had violated the Clean Air Act at its terminal located in Kawaihae, Hawaii by "failing to equip its loading rack with pollution controls" and by "failing to limit emissions from its loading rack," and advising Mid Pac that the matter had been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ"). The DOJ proposed civil penalties of approximately   $700 thousand  . Subsequently, Mid Pac and the DOJ entered into a tolling agreement to facilitate settlement discussions. Mid Pac disputes the EPA's allegations. On   April 1, 2015  , we acquired Mid Pac. Mid Pac, the EPA and the DOJ have agreed to resolve the fines and penalties for   $200 thousand   and, among other things, the installation of a vapor combustion system by no later than   March 1, 2017  .  
  Additionally, from time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of our business. Please read   Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
   
  Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  We are subject to certain risks. For a discussion of these risks, see "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Risks Related to the   WRC Acquisition 
  We may fail to successfully integrate Wyoming Refining with our existing business in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or fail to realize all of the expected benefits of the   WRC Acquisition  , which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition. 
  
   51 

Integration of Wyoming Refining with our existing business will be a complex, time-consuming and costly process, particularly given that the acquisition of Wyoming Refining significantly increased our size and diversified the geographic areas in which we operate. A failure to successfully integrate Wyoming Refining with our existing business in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The difficulties of combining Wyoming Refining with our existing business include, among other things: 
             
    operating a larger combined organization and adding operations; 

difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of Wyoming Refining; 

customer or key employee loss from Wyoming Refining;  

the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; 

integrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; 

managing relationships with new customers and suppliers for whom we have not previously provided products or services; 

maintaining an effective system of internal controls related to Wyoming Refining and integrating internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other regulatory compliance and corporate governance matters; 

an inability to complete other internal growth projects and/or acquisitions; 

difficulties integrating new technology systems that we have not historically used in our operations or financial reporting; 

an increase in our indebtedness; 

potential environmental or regulatory compliance matters or liabilities and title issues, including certain liabilities arising from Wyoming Refining's operations before our acquisition of Wyoming Refining;  

coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities; and 

coordinating and consolidating corporate and administrative functions. 
       
  If any of these risks or unanticipated liabilities or costs were to materialize, then any desired benefits of the acquisition of Wyoming Refining may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Wyoming Refining business may actually perform at levels below the forecasts we used to evaluate the acquisition of Wyoming Refining due to factors that are beyond our control, such as competition in Wyoming Refining's region, market demand for the products Wyoming Refining produces and regulatory requirements for maintenance and improvement projects that impact Wyoming Refining. If Wyoming Refining performs at levels below the forecasts we used to evaluate the acquisition of Wyoming Refining, then our future results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
  The   WRC Acquisition   may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating potential liabilities. 
  Our recent growth is due in large part to acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of Texadian, PHR, Mid Pac and the   WRC Acquisition  . We expect acquisitions to be instrumental to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of potential unknown and contingent liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform due diligence reviews of acquired companies and their businesses that we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, such reviews will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our reviews, including the due diligence we conducted in connection with the   WRC Acquisition  , may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with potential environmental problems or other contingent and unknown liabilities that may exist or arise. 
  As a result, there may be unknown and contingent liabilities related to Wyoming Refining and its business of which we are unaware. We could be liable for unknown obligations relating to the   WRC Acquisition   for which indemnification is not available, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
  
   52 

Financing the   WRC Acquisition   substantially increased our outstanding indebtedness. 
  We funded the   WRC Acquisition   with net proceeds from the Par Wyoming Holdings Term Loan, the Bridge Notes, which have subsequently been repaid with the net proceeds from our rights offering and converted into shares of our common stock, and cash on hand, which included the net proceeds from our notes offering. The resulting increase in our outstanding indebtedness may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditure or working capital needs because we will require additional funds to service our outstanding indebtedness and may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.  
  Flaws in our due diligence in connection with the   WRC Acquisition   could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  We conducted limited due diligence in connection with the   WRC Acquisition  . Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting, finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process and the fact that such efforts do not always lead to a consummated transaction. Diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect a particular entity. In addition, factors outside the control of the entity and outside of our control may later arise. If, during the diligence process, we failed to identify issues specific to an entity or the environment in which the entity operates, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in other reporting losses. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate financial or other covenants under our debt financings. We cannot assure you that we will not have to take write-downs or write-offs in connection with the acquisitions of certain of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Wyoming Refining, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  In connection with the   WRC Acquisition  , we will be required to undertake significant remediation and other corrective actions with respect to certain environmental matters. 
  In connection with the   WRC Acquisition  , there are several environmental issues that will require us to undertake significant remediation efforts and other corrective actions. The Wyoming refinery, owned by Wyoming Refining, is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders and settlement agreements involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late 1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the Wyoming refinery. 
  As is typical of older small refineries like the Wyoming refinery, the largest cost component arising from these various decrees relates to the investigation, monitoring and remediation of soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment contamination associated with the facility s historic operations. Investigative work by Wyoming Refining and negotiations with the relevant agencies as to remedial approaches remain ongoing on a number of aspects of the contamination, meaning that investigation, monitoring and remediation costs are not reasonably estimable for some elements of these efforts. Based on current information, however, preliminary estimates we have received for the well-understood components of these efforts suggest total response costs of approximately $20.0 million, approximately one-third of which we expect to incur in the next five years and the remainder being incurred over approximately 30 years.  
  Additionally, we believe the Wyoming refinery will need to modify or close a series of wastewater impoundments in the next several years and to replace those impoundments with a new wastewater treatment system. Based on preliminary information, reasonable estimates we have received suggest costs of approximately $2.1 million to modify or close the existing wastewater treatment ponds and approximately $11.6 million to design and construct a new wastewater treatment system. 
   Finally, among the various historic consent decrees, orders and settlement agreements into which the Wyoming refinery has entered, there are several penalty orders associated with exceedances of permitted limits by the Wyoming refinery s wastewater discharges. Although the frequency of these exceedances appears to be declining over time, we may become subject to new penalty enforcement action in the next several years, which could involve penalties in excess of $100,000. Moreover, in addition to the issues associated with the Wyoming refinery, certain product pipeline assets were acquired in the   WRC Acquisition  . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration ( PHMSA ) recently conducted an integrated inspection of the products pipeline with additional follow-up regarding integrity management planning and general operations and maintenance. Based on preliminary discussions with PHMSA following this inspection, the Wyoming refinery anticipates a civil penalty in excess of $100,000. In connection with our acquisition of, and commencement of operations at, the Wyoming refinery, findings of a past failure to comply with applicable environmental or pipeline safety laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties that could be in excess of $100,000, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
  
   53 

The volatility of crude oil prices and refined product prices and changes in the demand for such products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Expected earnings and cash flows from the   WRC Acquisition   depend on a number of factors, including to a large extent the cost of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks which has fluctuated significantly in recent years. While prices for refined products are influenced by the price of crude oil, the constantly changing margin between the price we pay for crude oil and other refinery feedstocks and the prices we receive for refined products ( crack spread ) also fluctuates significantly. The prices we pay and prices we receive depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the global supply and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products, which are subject to, among other things: 

changes in the global economy and the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products; 

availability of crude oil and refined products and the infrastructure to transport crude oil and refined products; 

local factors, including market conditions, the level of operations of other refineries in our markets and the volume and price of refined products imported; 

threatened or actual terrorist incidents, acts of war and other global political conditions; 

government regulations; and 

weather conditions, hurricanes or other natural disasters. 
       
  In addition, we purchase our refinery feedstocks before manufacturing and selling the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the manufactured refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant impact on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for sale to our customers. Price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Wyoming Refining is particularly vulnerable to disruptions to our refining operations because its refining operations are concentrated in one facility, which is scheduled for a maintenance turnaround during 2019 and 2020 that will involve significant expenditures. 
  Because all of Wyoming Refining's refining operations are concentrated in the Wyoming refinery, a significant disruption at the Newcastle facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Wyoming Refining expects to perform a significant maintenance turnaround at the Wyoming refinery during 2019 and 2020, which will involve anticipated expenditures of $30 million to $31 million. All or a portion of its refinery s production may be halted or disrupted during the turnaround and the turnaround, if unsuccessful or delayed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
  In addition, the Wyoming refinery may require additional unscheduled down time for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds. Refinery operations may also be disrupted by external factors such as a suspension of feedstock deliveries or an interruption of electricity, natural gas, water treatment or other utilities. Other potentially disruptive factors include natural disasters, severe weather conditions, workplace or environmental accidents, interruptions of supply, work stoppages, losses of permits or authorizations or acts of terrorism. Disruptions to our refining operations could reduce our revenues during the period of time that our processing units are not operating. 
  The financial and operating results for Wyoming Refining, including the products it refines and distributes, are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year. 
  The operating results for Wyoming Refining, including the products it refines and sells, can be seasonal. Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic. Wyoming Refining's financial and operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters may be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year as a result of this seasonality. 
  
   54 

Risks Related to Regulation 
  We could be held responsible in the future for decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own. 
  Under state and federal law, oil and gas companies are obligated to plug and abandon ( P A ) a well and restore the lease to pre-operating conditions after operations cease. U.S. state and federal regulations allow the government to call upon predecessors in interest of oil and gas leases to pay for P A, restoration and decommissioning obligations if the current operator fails to fulfill those obligations, the costs of which could be significant. On March 23, 2016, we assigned our interests in the Point Arguello Unit offshore California to Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation; however, as a former record title holder, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management could call upon us to fulfill the P A obligations related to these divested assets if the then current lessee of those assets are unable to fulfill their obligations. 
  Renewable fuels mandates may reduce demand for the petroleum fuels we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the   WRC Acquisition  . 
  The EPA has issued Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS ) mandates, requiring refiners such as us to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels they produce and sell in the U.S. We, and other refiners subject to RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program, those refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as renewable identification numbers ( RINs ), to maintain compliance. To the extent that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable fuels, we generate our own RINs that we have the option of retaining for current or future RFS compliance or selling on the open market. 
  Under the RFS program, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties are required to blend into their finished petroleum fuels increases annually over time until 2022. Our refineries in Hawaii and Wyoming are subject to compliance with the RFS mandates. On November 30, 2015, the EPA issued final volume mandates for the years 2014 through 2016, which are generally lower than the corresponding statutory mandates for those years.  
  Existing laws, regulations or regulatory initiatives could change and, notwithstanding that the EPA s proposed volume mandates for 2014 through 2016 are generally lower than the corresponding statutory mandate for those years, the final minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels could increase in the future. Despite a decline in RINs prices from relatively higher levels observed during mid- 2013, we cannot currently predict the future prices of RINs and, thus, the expenses related to acquiring RINs in the future could increase relative to the cost in prior years. During 2015, we paid $6.3 million for RINs and expect to pay approximately the same amount in 2016 for our Hawaii refinery. We also expect to incur additional expenses related to acquiring RINs for our Wyoming refinery during 2016. Any increase in the final minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels and/or any increase in the cost to acquire RINs has the potential to result in significant costs in connection with RINs compliance for 2016 and future years, for costs which could be material and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, while there is no current regulatory standard that authenticates RINs that may be purchased on the open market from third parties, we believe that the RINs we purchase are from reputable sources, are valid and serve to demonstrate compliance with applicable RFS requirements. However, if this belief proves incorrect and the RINs that we purchase are not valid or in compliance with applicable RFS requirements, our financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.
