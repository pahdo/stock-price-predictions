A. 
    Statement of Information Furnished 
       
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Crown Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the  Company ).  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Form 10-Q instructions.  In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and the results of its operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and of its cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The results reported in these consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  These results have been determined on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

    Accounting and Reporting Developments 
       
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to how an entity should recognize revenue.  The guidance specifies that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In addition, the guidance expands the required disclosures related to revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company will adopt this standard on a modified retrospective basis.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the subsequent measurement of inventory.  Under existing guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market, where market was defined as replacement cost, with a ceiling of net realizable value and floor of net realizable value less a normal profit margin.  The new guidance requires an entity to subsequently measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on lease accounting.  Under the new guidance lease classification criteria and income statement recognition is similar to current guidance; however, all leases with a lease term longer than one year will be recorded on the balance sheet through a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.  The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on share-based payments.  The new guidance includes provisions to simplify various aspects of how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Under the current guidance, upon settlement tax benefits in excess of compensation costs ("windfalls") are recorded in equity and tax deficiencies ("shortfalls") are recorded in equity to the extent of previous windfalls.  Under the new guidance all of the tax effects related to share-based payments at settlement will be recorded through the income statement.  The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows.  Under the new guidance, cash payments resulting from debt prepayment or extinguishment will be classified as cash outflows from financing activities.   In addition, beneficial interests obtained in a securitization of 
  
   7 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

financial assets should be disclosed as a noncash activity and cash receipts from the beneficial interests should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities.  Under existing guidance, the Company classifies cash receipts from beneficial interests in securitized receivables and cash payments resulting from debt prepayment or extinguishment as cash flows from operating activities.  The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance, which may have a material impact on its cash flows from operating activities. 

C.      Acquisitions 
    
  On   February 18, 2015  , the Company completed its acquisition of Empaque, a leading manufacturer of beverage packaging in Mexico, from Heineken N.V., in a cash transaction valued at   $1.2 billion  .  The addition of Empaque significantly increases the Company's presence in the growing Mexican market and substantially enhances the Company's strategic position in beverage cans, both regionally and globally.  
    
  The Company finalized its purchase accounting for the Empaque acquisition in the first quarter of 2016.  There were no adjustments to the preliminary valuation of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as compared to the amounts disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

D. 
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income    
       
  The following table provides information about the changes in each component of accumulated  other  comprehensive income.

E.  
    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  A summary of restricted stock transactions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   follows: 

9 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

The performance-based awards   cliff vest at the end of three years  . The number of performance-based shares that will ultimately vest is based on the level of market performance achieved, ranging between   0%   and   200%   of the shares originally awarded, and will be settled in stock. The market performance criteria is the Company's Total Shareholder Return ("TSR"), which includes share price appreciation and dividends paid, during the three-year term of the award measured against the TSR of a peer group of companies. 
    
  The time-vesting restricted and deferred stock awards vest ratably over three to five years. 
    
  The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 2016 time-vesting stock awards was   $51.04   and the performance-based stock awards was   $51.18  . 
    
  The fair value of the performance-based shares awarded in   2016   was calculated using a   Monte Carlo   valuation model, including a weighted average stock price volatility of   19.8%  , an expected term of   three   years, and a weighted average risk-free interest rate of   1.22%  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested stock awards was   $36  . The weighted average period over which the expense is expected to be recognized is   2.0   years.  The aggregate market value of the shares released on the vesting dates was   $26   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

F. 
    Receivables 

The Company uses receivable securitization facilities in the normal course of business as part of managing its cash flows.  In connection with certain receivable securitization facilities, the Company recognized deferred purchase price receivables of   $107   and   $105   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The net change in deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the receivables line item in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

G. 
    Inventories 
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost for U.S. inventories principally determined under the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method. Non-U.S. inventories are principally determined under the FIFO or average cost method. 

H. 
    Derivative and Other Financial Instruments 
       
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Under GAAP a framework exists for measuring fair value, providing a three-tier hierarchy of pricing inputs used to     report assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value. Level 1 includes inputs such as quoted prices which are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the report date. Level 2 includes inputs other than those available in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 
  includes unobservable pricing inputs that are not corroborated by market data or other objective sources. The Company has no recurring items valued using Level 3 inputs other than certain pension plan assets. 
  
   10 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company applies a   market approach   to value its commodity price hedge contracts. Prices from observable markets are used to develop the fair value of these financial instruments and they are reported under Level 2. The Company uses an   income approach   to value its foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model that calculates the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using market information as of the reporting date, such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and are reported under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Fair value disclosures for financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis are provided later in this note.  In addition, see    Note J    for fair value disclosures related to debt. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  In the normal course of business the Company is subject to risk from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Company manages these risks through a program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily swaps and forwards. Counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
    
  The Company s objective in managing exposure to market risk is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flow.    The extent to which the Company uses such instruments is dependent upon its access to these contracts in the financial markets and its success using other methods, such as netting exposures in the same currencies to mitigate foreign exchange risk and using sales agreements that permit the pass-through of commodity price and foreign exchange rate risk to customers. 
    
  For derivative financial instruments accounted for in hedging relationships, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the manner in which effectiveness will be assessed. The Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the hedging relationships are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures.  When a hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting the change in fair value from the date of the last effectiveness test is recognized in earnings.  Any gain or loss which has accumulated in other comprehensive income at the date of the last effectiveness test is reclassified into earnings at the same time of the underlying exposure. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  The Company designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. No components of the hedging instruments are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Changes in fair value of outstanding derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for ineffectiveness, are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction. Classification of the gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon reclassification from comprehensive income is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   mature between   one   and   twenty-five   months. 
    
  When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that an anticipated transaction will occur in the originally specified period, changes to fair value accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. 
    
  The Company uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated purchases of various commodities, including aluminum, fuel oil and natural gas and these exposures are hedged by a central treasury unit. 
    
  The Company also designates certain foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated sales or purchases. The Company manages these risks at the operating unit level. Often, foreign currency risk is hedged together with the related commodity price risk.  
    
  The following table sets forth financial information about the impact on accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and earnings from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. 
  
   11 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recognized gains of   $1   (  $1   net of tax) and   $2   (  $1   net of tax) in earnings related to hedge ineffectiveness caused by volatility in the metal premium component of aluminum prices.  
    
  For the twelve month period ending September 30, 2017, a net   gain   of   $9   (  $7   net of tax) is expected to be reclassified to earnings.   No   amounts were reclassified during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   in connection with anticipated transactions that were no longer considered probable. 
    
  Fair Value Hedges and Contracts Not Designated as Hedges 
    
  The Company designates certain derivative financial instruments as fair value hedges of recognized foreign-denominated assets and liabilities, generally trade accounts receivable and payable and unrecognized firm commitments. The notional values and maturity dates of the derivative instruments coincide with those of the hedged items. Changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments, excluding time value, are offset by changes in fair value of the related hedged items. 
    
  Other than for firm commitments, amounts related to time value are excluded from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness and are reported in earnings. Less than   $1   was reported in earnings for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Certain derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts related to intercompany debt, were not designated in hedge relationships; however, they are effective economic hedges as the changes in their fair value, except for time value, are offset by changes in re-measurement of the related hedged items. The Company s primary use of these derivative instruments is to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency.  Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are immediately recognized in earnings as foreign exchange adjustments. 
    
  The impact on earnings from foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges was a   loss   of   $1   and a   loss   of   $6   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and a   loss   of less than   $1   and a   gain   of less than   $1   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The impact on earnings from foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedges was a   gain   of   $6   and a   gain   of   $32   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and  a   gain   of   $24 
  
   12 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

and a   loss   of   $19   for the same period in   2015  . These adjustments were reported within foreign exchange in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were offset by changes in the fair values of the related underlying hedged items. 
    
  For the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , certain commodity hedges did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and therefore the change in their fair value during the quarter was recognized in earnings.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a gain of   $1   (  $1   net of tax) and a gain of   $5   (  $4   net of tax) in earnings related to these ineffective hedges. 
    
  Net Investment Hedges  
    
  The Company designates certain derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (debt) as hedges of its net investment in a euro-based subsidiary and recorded a   loss   of   $13   (  $8   net of tax) and a    loss   of   $31   (  $20   net of tax) in accumulated other comprehensive income during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
    Fair Values of Derivative Financial Instruments and Valuation Hierarchy 
    
  The following table sets forth the fair value hierarchy for the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for  at fair value on a recurring basis as of    September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Certain derivative financial instruments are subject to agreements with counterparties similar to master netting arrangements and are  eligible for offset.   The Company has made an  accounting  policy election not to offset the fair values of these instruments within the statement of financial position.  In the table below, the aggregate fair values of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities are presented on both a gross and net basis, where appropriate.

Notional Values of Outstanding Derivative Instruments 
    
  The aggregate U.S. dollar-equivalent notational values of outstanding derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 were: 

I. 
    Restructuring and Other 
       
  The Company recorded restructuring and other charges as follows:   

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded charges of   $3   to write down the carrying value of fixed assets and   $3   for termination benefits related to the announced closure of a beverage plant in the Company's Asia Pacific segment.  The Company announced plans to close the plant in an effort to reduce cost by consolidating manufacturing processes in China. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, other costs primarily relate to pension settlement charges. 
    
  A summary of the outstanding accrual balances associated with current and prior restructuring actions is provided below.   
    
    2015 European Division Actions 
    
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred charges of   $17   re  lated to the closure of     two     facilities in its   European Food segment.  The closures are expected to reduce cost by eliminating excess capacity and consolidating manufacturing processes.   

14 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

The facility closures are expected to result in the reduction of approximately   280   employees when completed in early 2017.  The Company expects to incur   $3   of future charges related to these actions. 
    
  The table below summarizes the restructuring accrual balances and utilization by cost type for these actions.   

Other Actions 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had a restructuring accrual of   $13   primarily related to prior actions to reduce manufacturing capacity and headcount in its European Aerosol and Specialty Packaging businesses.  The Company expects to pay the liability through 2024 as certain employees have elected to receive payment as a fixed monthly sum over future years.  The accrual also included   $3   related to the announced closure of a beverage plant in the Company's Asia Pacific segment as discussed above.  The Company continues to review its supply and demand profile and long-term plans in its businesses, and it is possible that the Company may record additional restructuring charges in the future.   

J. 
    Debt 
       
  The Company's outstanding debt was as follows: 

15 

The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term borrowings, using a market approach incorporating Level 2 inputs such as quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, was   $5,445   at   September 30, 2016   and   $5,540   at   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  In February 2016, the Company amended its credit agreement to provide for an additional   $300   of term loan borrowings, the proceeds of which, along with borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and cash on hand were used to redeem the Company's   $700     6.25%   senior notes due 2021.  In connection with the redemption, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of   $27   for premiums paid and the write-off of deferred financing fees. 
    
  In September 2016, the Company issued    600   (  $675   at September 30, 2016) principal amount of   2.625%   senior unsecured notes due 2024. The notes were issued at par by Crown European Holdings S.A., a subsidiary of the Company, and are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Company used the proceeds to repay a portion of the Euro term loan facility. In connection with the repayment, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of   $7   for the write-off of deferred financing fees.  
    
  In September 2016, the Company also issued   $400   principal amount of   4.25%   senior unsecured notes due 2026. The notes were issued at par by Crown Americas LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, and are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Company used the proceeds to repay a portion of the U.S dollar term loan facility. In connection with the repayment, the Company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of   $3   for the write-off of deferred financing fees.  

K. 
    Asbestos-Related Liabilities 
       
  Crown Cork   Seal Company, Inc. ( Crown Cork ) is one of many defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits filed throughout the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. These claims arose from the insulation operations of a U.S. company, the majority of whose stock Crown Cork purchased in 1963. Approximately   ninety   days after the stock purchase, this U.S. company sold its insulation assets and was later merged into Crown Cork. 
    
  Prior to 1998, amounts paid to asbestos claimants were covered by a fund made available to Crown Cork under a 1985 settlement with carriers insuring Crown Cork through 1976, when Crown Cork became self-insured. The fund was depleted in 1998 and the Company has no remaining coverage for asbestos-related costs. 
    
  In December 2001, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted legislation that limits the asbestos-related liabilities of Pennsylvania corporations that are successors by corporate merger to companies involved with asbestos. The legislation limits the successor s liability for asbestos to the acquired company s asset value adjusted for inflation. Crown Cork has 
  paid significantly more for asbestos-related claims than the acquired company s adjusted asset value. In November 2004, the legislation was amended to address a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision (Ieropoli v. AC S Corporation, et. al., No. 117 EM 2002) which held that the statute violated the Pennsylvania Constitution due to retroactive application. The Company cautions that the limitations of the statute, as amended, are subject to litigation and may not be upheld.  
    
  In June 2003, the state of Texas enacted legislation that limits the asbestos-related liabilities in Texas courts of companies such as Crown Cork that allegedly incurred these liabilities because they are successors by corporate merger to companies that had been involved with asbestos. The Texas legislation, which applies to future claims and pending claims, caps asbestos-related liabilities at the total gross value of the predecessor s assets adjusted for inflation. Crown Cork has paid significantly more for asbestos-related claims than the total adjusted value of its predecessor s assets. 
    
  In October 2010, the Texas Supreme Court, in a 6-2 decision, reversed a lower court decision, Barbara Robinson v. Crown Cork   Seal Company, Inc., No. 14-04-00658-CV, Fourteenth Court of Appeals, Texas, which had upheld the dismissal of an asbestos-related case against Crown Cork. The Texas Supreme Court held that the Texas legislation was unconstitutional under the Texas Constitution when applied to asbestos-related claims pending against Crown Cork when the legislation was enacted in June 2003. The Company believes that the decision of the Texas Supreme Court is limited to retroactive application of the Texas legislation to asbestos-related cases that were pending against Crown Cork in Texas on June 11, 2003 and therefore, in its accrual, continues to assign no value to claims filed after June 11, 2003. 
    
  In recent years, the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming enacted legislation that limits asbestos-related liabilities under state law of companies such as  
  
    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Crown Cork that allegedly incurred these liabilities because they are successors by corporate  merger to companies that had been involved with asbestos.  The legislation, which applies to future and, with the exception of Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming, pending claims, caps asbestos-related liabilities at the fair market value of the predecessor's total gross assets adjusted for inflation.   Crown Cork has paid significantly more for asbestos-related claims than the total value of its predecessor's assets adjusted for inflation.  Crown Cork has integrated the legislation into its claims defense strategy.  
    
  The Company further cautions that an adverse ruling in any litigation relating to the constitutionality or applicability to Crown Cork of one or more statutes that limits the asbestos-related liability of alleged defendants like Crown Cork could have a material impact on the Company. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company paid   $12   to settle outstanding claims and had claims activity as follows: 

In the fourth quarter of each year, the Company performs an analysis of outstanding claims and categorizes these claims by year of exposure and state filed.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company's outstanding claims were: 

The outstanding claims in each period exclude approximately   19,000   inactive claims. Due to the passage of time, the Company considers it unlikely that the plaintiffs in these cases will pursue further action against the Company. The exclusion of these inactive claims had no effect on the calculation of the Company s accrual as the claims were filed in states, as described above, where the Company s liability is limited by statute. 
    
  With respect to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during 1964, the Company does not include in its accrual any amounts for settlements in states where the Company s liability is limited by statute except for certain pending claims in Texas as described earlier.   
    
  With respect to post-1964 claims, regardless of the existence of asbestos legislation, the Company does not include in its accrual any amounts for settlement of these claims because of increased difficulty of establishing identification of relevant insulation products as the cause of injury. Given the Company's settlement experience with post-1964 claims, it does not believe that an adverse ruling in the Texas or Pennsylvania asbestos litigation cases, or in any other state that has enacted asbestos legislation, would have a material impact on the Company with respect to such claims. 
    
  As of December 31, the percentage of outstanding claims related to claimants alleging serious diseases (primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies) were as follows: 

Crown Cork has entered into arrangements with plaintiffs  counsel in certain jurisdictions with respect to claims which are not yet filed, or asserted, against it. However, Crown Cork expects claims under these arrangements to be filed or asserted against Crown Cork in the future. The projected value of these claims is included in the Company s estimated liability as of   September 30, 2016  . 

17 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s accrual for pending and future asbestos-related claims and related legal costs was $  254  , including $  205   for unasserted claims. The Company s accrual includes estimated probable costs for claims through the year   2025  . The Company s accrual excludes potential costs for claims beyond   2025   because the Company believes that the key assumptions underlying its accrual are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. 
    
  It is reasonably possible that the actual loss could be in excess of the Company s accrual. The Company is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss in excess of its accrual due to uncertainty in the following assumptions that underlie the Company s accrual and the possibility of losses in excess of such accrual: the amount of damages sought by the claimant (which was not specified for approximately   82%   of the claims outstanding at the end of   2015  ), the Company and claimant s willingness to negotiate a settlement, the terms of settlements of other defendants with asbestos-related liabilities, the bankruptcy filings of other defendants  (which may result in additional claims and higher settlements for non-bankrupt defendants), the nature of pending and future claims (including the seriousness of alleged disease, whether claimants allege first exposure to asbestos before or during 1964 and the claimant s ability to demonstrate the alleged link to Crown Cork), the volatility of the litigation environment, the defense strategies available to the Company, the level of future claims, the rate of receipt of claims, the jurisdiction in which claims are filed, and the effect of state asbestos legislation (including the validity and applicability of the Pennsylvania legislation to non-Pennsylvania jurisdictions, where the substantial majority of the Company s asbestos cases are filed). 

L. 
    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
       
  The Company, along with others in most cases, has been identified by the EPA or a comparable state environmental agency as a Potentially Responsible Party ( PRP ) at a number of sites and has recorded aggregate accruals of   $7   for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites. The Company has been identified as having either directly or indirectly disposed of commercial or industrial waste at the sites subject to the accrual, and where appropriate and supported by available information, generally has agreed to be responsible for a percentage of future remediation costs based on an estimated volume of materials disposed in proportion to the total materials disposed at each site. The Company has not had monetary sanctions imposed nor has the Company been notified of any potential monetary sanctions at any of the sites. 
    
  The Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of   $7   for remediation activities at various worldwide locations that are owned by the Company and for which the Company is not a member of a PRP group.  Although the Company believes 
  its accruals are adequate to cover its portion of future remediation costs, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the amount of the Company s accruals and will not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial position and cash flow. Any possible loss or range of potential loss that may be incurred in excess of the recorded accruals cannot be estimated. 
    
  In March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office ( FCO ), conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company.  The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the market for the supply of metal packaging products. The FCO s investigation is ongoing. To date, the FCO has not officially charged the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any violations of competition law. The Company has commenced an internal investigation into the matter and has discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company.  The Company is cooperating with the FCO and submitted a leniency application which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to date and which may lead to the reduction of  penalties that the  FCO may impose.  If the FCO finds that the Company or any of its  subsidiaries violated competition law, the FCO has wide discretion to levy fines. At this stage of the investigation the Company believes that a loss is probable.  However, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the FCO s investigation and is unable to estimate the loss or possible range of any additional losses that could be incurred, which could be material to the Company s operating results and cash flows for the periods in which they are resolved or become reasonably estimable. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to governmental, labor, environmental, securities, vendor and other matters arising out of the Company s normal course of business. While the impact on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company s consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flow. 

18 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of the ordinary course of business. The Company s basic raw materials for its products are steel and aluminum, both of which are purchased from multiple sources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its selling prices to reflect these movements. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully recover any increases or fluctuations in raw material costs from its customers. The Company also has commitments for standby letters of credit and for purchases of capital assets. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was party to certain indemnification agreements covering environmental remediation, lease payments and other potential costs associated with properties sold or businesses divested. For agreements with defined liability limits the maximum potential amount of future liability was   $6  . The Company accrues for costs related to these items when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had guarantees of   $22   related to the residual values of leased assets. 

M. 
    Earnings Per Share 
       
  The following table summarizes the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to the Company.  

For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   0.1 million   and   0.5 million   contingently issuable common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.  

N. 
    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
       
  The components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

19 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also recorded pension settlement charges of   $9   and   $12   which were included in restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

O. 
    Income Taxes 
     The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income as a result of the following items:    

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a benefit of   $31   to release the valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in Canada.  The Company's operations in Canada recently returned to profitability in part due to benefits from recent restructuring actions and improved cost performance.  Based on current projections, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the deferred tax assets.  The Company's loss carryforwards in Canada expire at various dates beginning in 2026.  If future changes impact the Company's profitability in Canada, it is possible that the Company may record an additional valuation allowance in the future. 
     
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Spanish tax authorities concluded their audits of Mivisa's Spanish operations for the years 2009 to 2014.   In connection with the audits, the Company recognized a charge of   $8   to settle certain tax contingencies.   
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a charge of   $5   to write off certain tax credit carryforwards that the Company will be unable to utilize as a result of an internal reorganization of the Company's operations in the U.K.

P. 
    Segment Information 
       
  The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on segment income. Segment income, which is not a defined term under GAAP, is defined by the Company as income from operations adjusted to add back provisions for asbestos and restructuring and other, the impact of fair value adjustments related to the sale of inventory acquired in an acquisition and the timing impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Segment income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.  
    
  The tables below present information about the Company's operating segments. 

The primary sources of revenue included in non-reportable segments are the Company's aerosol can businesses in North America and Europe, its specialty packaging business in Europe and its tooling and equipment operations in the U.S. and U.K.      

Intersegment sales primarily include sales of ends and components used to manufacture cans, such as printed and coated  metal, as well as parts and equipment used in the manufacturing process. 

21 

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

A reconciliation of segment income of reportable segments to income before income taxes is as follows: 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, intercompany profit of   $8   and   $12   was eliminated within segment income of non-reportable segments.   
    
  Corporate and unallocated items includes corporate and division administrative costs, technology costs, and unallocated items such as the U.S. and U.K. pension plan costs, fair value adjustments for the sale of inventory acquired in an acquisition and the timing impact of hedge ineffectiveness.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 2.        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (dollars in millions) 
    
    Introduction 
    
  The following discussion presents management's analysis of the results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 and changes in financial condition and liquidity from December 31, 2015.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in and referred to within this report. 
    
  Business Strategy and Trends 
    
  The Company's strategy is to grow its businesses in targeted international growth markets, while improving operations and results in more mature markets through disciplined pricing, cost control and careful capital allocation.  
    
  In recent years, beverage can sales unit volumes in the Company's mature markets have been stable to slightly declining in the U.S. and Canada and slightly increasing in Western European markets. Beverage can volume has generally continued to grow in emerging markets driven by increased per capita incomes and consumption, combined with an increased preference for cans over other forms of beverage packaging. Global food and aerosol can sales unit volumes have been stable to declining in recent years primarily due to lower consumer spending. While the opportunity for organic volume growth in the Company's mature markets is not comparable to that in targeted international growth markets, the Company continues to generate strong returns on invested capital and significant cash flow from these businesses. The Company monitors capacity across all of its businesses and, where necessary, may take action such as closing a plant or reducing headcount to better manage its costs. Any or all of these actions may result in additional restructuring charges in the future which may be material.  
    
  As part of the Company's efforts to manage cost, it attempts to pass-through increases in the cost of aluminum and steel to its customers.  Aluminum and steel prices can be subject to significant volatility and there has not been a consistent and predictable trend in pricing.   
    
  In 2016, the Company expects to utilize cash flow to reduce leverage.   The Company will also continue to evaluate select growth opportunities through capacity additions in existing plants, new plants in markets that it already knows and understands, and potential strategic acquisitions in geographic areas and product lines in which it already operates or that complement its existing businesses.  In response to increasing global customer demand for beverage cans in non-standard sizes, commonly called "specialty cans," the Company intends to continue to make investments in converting existing capacity or adding new capacity for non-standard can sizes.  The Company currently expects to use a portion of its cash flow in 2016 to repay debt, and cash flows generated from the Company's operations may also be reinvested in the business, used for acquisitions (which may increase the Company s leverage), or returned to shareholders through share repurchases or possible future dividends. 

Results of Operations 
    
  In assessing performance, the key performance measure used by the Company is segment income, a non-GAAP measure generally defined by the Company as income from operations adjusted to add back provisions for asbestos and restructuring and other, the impact of fair value adjustments related to the sale of inventory acquired in an acquisition and the timing impact of hedge ineffectiveness.

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  The foreign currency translation impacts referred to below were primarily due to changes in the euro and pound sterling in the Company's European businesses, the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso in the Company's Americas segments and the Chinese renminbi and Thai baht in the Company's Asia Pacific segment.  The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency translation by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the applicable prior year average foreign exchange rates. 

Net Sales and Segment Income       

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and the pass-through of lower material costs.  Net sales would have been $55 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.  
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and the pass-through of lower material costs, partially offset by the impact of an additional six weeks of Empaque results, which was acquired in February 2015.  Net sales would have been $200 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.  
    
  Discussion and analysis of net sales and segment income by segment follows.    

Americas Beverage 
    
  The Americas Beverage segment manufactures aluminum beverage cans, ends, steel crowns, glass bottles and aluminum closures and supplies a variety of customers from its operations in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico. The U.S. and Canadian beverage can markets are mature markets which have experienced stable to slightly declining volumes in recent years.  In Mexico, the Company's sales unit volumes have increased primarily due to market growth and the acquisition of Empaque in February 2015.  The addition of Empaque significantly increased the Company's presence in the growing Mexican market and substantially enhances the Company's strategic position in beverage cans, both regionally and globally.  In Brazil and Colombia, the Company's sales unit volumes have increased in recent years primarily due to market growth driven by increased per capita income and consumption, combined with an increased preference for cans over other forms of beverage packaging.  
    
  The Company has announced plans to construct new beverage can plants in Nichols, New York and Monterrey, Mexico.  To meet customers' demand for specialty beverage cans in North America, the Nichols plant will be capable of producing multiple can sizes and is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2017.  The Monterrey plant will also be capable of producing multiple can sizes and is expected to be operational late in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, the Company has announced plans to expand production capacity in Colombia which is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2017.

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Net sales and segment income in the Americas Beverage segment are as follows:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by higher sales unit volumes.  Net sales would have been $22 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015. 
    
  Segment income increased primarily due to higher sales unit volumes and a benefit of $4 from lower aluminum premium costs in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and $5 of start-up costs associated with the Company's projects in Nichols, New York and Monterrey, Mexico.  Segment income would have been $4 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due the impact of foreign currency translation and the pass-through of lower material costs partially offset by a 7% increase in sales unit volumes, which includes the impact of Empaque for an additional six weeks. Net sales would have been $105 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   
    
  Segment income increased primarily due to $33 from higher sales unit volumes, including the impact of Empaque and improved cost performance, and a benefit of $14 from lower aluminum premium costs in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and $5 of start-up costs.  Segment income would have been $16 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015. 

North America Food 
    
  The North America Food segment manufactures steel and aluminum food cans and ends and metal vacuum closures and supplies a variety of customers from its operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The North American food can and closures market is a mature market which has experienced stable to slightly declining volumes in recent years.  In 2015, the Company announced the closure of two North America food can plants to more appropriately align capacity with customer demand and reduce costs.   
    
  Net sales and segment income in the North America Food segment are as follows:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to 6% lower sales unit volumes.  Segment income remained constant as the impact of lower sales unit volumes was offset by cost reduction initiatives. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to pass-through of lower tinplate costs, lower sales unit volumes and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Net sales would have been $12 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Segment income decreased primarily due to lower sales unit volume, including the loss of a customer during 2015,  the impact of steel purchased in 2015 being converted and sold at lower prevailing  prices in 2016 and inflation on non-steel input costs. 

European Beverage 
    
  The Company's European Beverage segment manufactures steel and aluminum beverage cans and ends and supplies a variety of customers from its operations throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.  In recent years, the European beverage can market has been growing.  
    
  In 2015, the Company announced plans to invest in a second line at its Osmaniye, Turkey plant in response to growing demand.  The new line will be capable of producing multiple can sizes and is expected to be operational late in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, the Company announced plans to begin installation of a second high-speed aluminum beverage can line at its Custines, France facility. Commercial startup of the line is expected in the second quarter of 2017 and will complete that plant's conversion from steel to aluminum.   
    
  Net sales and segment income in the European Beverage segment are as follows:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation.  Net sales would have been $14 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015. 
    
  Segment income increased primarily due to lower aluminum premiums, $4 from improved cost performance and $4 from sales unit volumes as higher volume in the Middle East offset lower volume in Europe, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.  Segment income would have been $2 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to the pass-through of lower aluminum costs and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 1% increase in sales unit volumes.  Net sales would have been $34 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   
    
  Segment income increased primarily due to lower aluminum premium costs and increased sales unit volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.  Segment income would have been $7 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   

European Food 
    
  The European Food segment manufactures steel and aluminum food cans, ends and metal vacuum closures, and supplies a variety of customers from its operations primarily throughout Europe and Africa. The European food can market is a mature market which has experienced stable to slightly declining volumes in recent years.  In 2015, the Company announced the closure of two European Food facilities in an effort to reduce cost by eliminating excess capacity and consolidating manufacturing processes.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Net sales and segment income in the European Food segment are as follows:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to 2% lower sales unit volumes partly due to adverse weather conditions, $14 from the pass-through of lower tinplate costs and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Net sales would have been $7 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   
    
  Segment income decreased primarily due to lower sales unit volumes, partially offset by improved cost performance including the impact of recent restructuring actions.   
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to product and geographic mix including a 1% decline in sales unit volumes, $34 from the pass-through of lower tinplate costs and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Net sales would have been $16 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   
    
  Segment income increased due to improved cost performance, including the impact of recent restructuring and other actions. 

Asia Pacific  
    
  The Company's Asia Pacific segment primarily consists of beverage can operations in Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam and also includes the Company's non-beverage can operations, primarily food cans and specialty packaging in China, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. In recent years, the beverage can market in Asia has been growing.  The Company's third beverage can plant in Cambodia began commercial production in the second quarter of 2016.  In China, the current industry supply of beverage cans exceeds demand, which has resulted in pricing pressure and negative impacts on the Company's profitability.  In response to the current situation in China, the Company continues to evaluate its strategic alternatives which may include future restructuring actions , the cost of which could be material. 
    
  Net sales and segment income in the Asia Pacific segment are as follows:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to $23 from reduced selling prices including the pass-through of lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales unit volume.  Sales unit volume increased 2% as increases in Southeast Asia offset lower volume in China.   
    
  Segment income was comparable, mainly due to the the impact of reduced selling prices in China offset by increased sales unit volumes in Southeast Asia.

    Crown Holdings, Inc. 

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to $69 from lower selling prices including the pass-through of lower raw material costs and the impact of competitive price compression and from the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher sales unit volumes. Net sales would have been $22 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.   
    
  Segment income was comparable, mainly due to the impact of lower selling prices in China offset by higher sales unit volumes in Southeast Asia. 

Non-reportable Segments 
    
  The Company's non-reportable segments include its European aerosol can and specialty packaging business, its North American aerosol can business and its tooling and equipment operations in the U.S. and U.K.  In recent years, the Company's aerosol can and specialty packaging businesses have experienced slightly declining volumes. In 2015, the Company completed the sale of four of its European industrial specialty packaging plants. 
    
  Net sales and segment income in non-reportable segments are as follows:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to $30 from lower sales in the Company's equipment operations and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Net sales would have been $6 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.  
    
  Segment income decreased primarily due to lower sales in the Company's equipment operations and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Segment income would have been $2 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015.  
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 
    
  Net sales decreased primarily due to $41 from the divestiture of certain operations within the Company's European aerosol and specialty packaging businesses in 2015, $34 from lower equipment sales, $15 from lower selling prices in the Company's aerosol and specialty packaging businesses, including the pass-through of lower tinplate prices, and the impact of foreign currency translation.  Net sales would have been $11 higher using exchange rates in effect during 2015. 
    
  Segment income decreased $2 due to the divestiture of certain operations within the Company's European aerosol and specialty packaging businesses in 2015, $6 from lower sales in the North America aerosol business and equipment business, partially offset by improved cost performance in the European aerosol and specialty packaging business.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Corporate and Unallocated Expense 

The three months ended September 30, 2015 included a charge of $7 related to the timing impact of hedge ineffectiveness as compared to a benefit of $2 in the three months ended September 30, 2016.    
    
  The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a charge of $3 related to the timing impact of hedge ineffectiveness as compared to a benefit of $6 in the three months ended September 30, 2016.   Additionally, corporate and unallocated expenses decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 due to $14 of lower pension costs, $7 of lower stock-based compensation expense and a charge of $6 related to fair value adjustments for the sale of inventory acquired in the acquisition of Empaque in 2015.  

Cost of Products Sold (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015, cost of products sold (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased from   $1,984   to   $1,838   and from $5,487 to $5,050 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and lower raw material costs.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the impact of the Empaque acquisition partially offset the impact of foreign currency translation and lower raw material costs.  Cost of products sold would have been $42 and $154 higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 using exchange rates in effect during 2015. 

Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased from   $61   to   $63   and from $174 to $188.  The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of Empaque.  

Selling and Administrative Expense 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, selling and administrative expense decreased from   $94   to   $90   primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, selling and administrative expense decreased from $291 to $275 primarily due to $7 from lower stock-compensation expense and $8 from the impact of foreign currency translation.  

Interest Expense 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015, interest expense decreased from   $68   to   $59   and from $202 to $181 primarily due to lower average debt outstanding.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 

Taxes on Income 
       
  The Company's effective income tax rate was as follows:   

The low effective income tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to a benefit recognized in the third quarter of 2016 to release the valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax assets in Canada as further discussed in    Note O    to the consolidated financial statements.   

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from   $19   to   $23   and from $48 to $59 primarily due to higher earnings in the Company's beverage can operations in Brazil. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash from Operations 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities increased from $  315   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    to $376 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to higher operating income and working capital improvements partially offset by increased pension contributions.  
    
  Days sales outstanding for trade receivables increased from 36 days at September 30, 2015 to 41 days at September 30, 2016 primarily due to longer customer payment terms and higher sales unit volumes in certain geographic locations partially offset by an 8 day decrease related to the derecognition of receivables under the Company's securitization and factoring programs. 
    
  Inventory turnover was 64 days at September 30, 2015 compared to 66 days at September 30, 2016.  Inventory turnover at September 30, 2016 increased compared to 63 days at December 31, 2015 due to seasonality in the Company's food and beverage can businesses.  The food can business is seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted.  The industry enters its busiest period in the the third quarter when the majority of fruits and vegetables in the Northern Hemisphere are harvested.  Due to this seasonality, inventory levels increase in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the second and third quarters.  The beverage can business is also seasonal with inventory levels generally increasing in the first half of the year to meet peak demand in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.   
  Days outstanding for trade payables increased from 84 days at September 30, 2015 to 94 days at September 30, 2016 primarily due to higher levels of inventory and longer payment terms with suppliers. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash used for investing activities decreased from $  1,374   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $228   in   2016   primarily due to funds paid for the acquisition of Empaque in 2015 partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.  The Company currently expects capital expenditures for 2016 to be approximately $450.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Financing activities provided cash of   $611   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    and used cash of   $328   in   2016   primarily due to higher net borrowings in 2015 to fund the acquisition of Empaque, a cash inflow from the settlement of foreign currency derivatives used to hedge intercompany debt obligations in 2016 compared to an outflow in 2015, and higher dividends paid to noncontrolling interest in 2016. 

Liquidity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , $463 of the Company's   $526   of cash and cash equivalents was located outside the U.S. The Company is not currently aware of any legal restrictions under foreign law that materially impact its access to cash held outside the U.S. 
    
  The Company funds its cash needs in the U.S. through a combination of cash flows from operations in the U.S., distributions from certain foreign subsidiaries, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the acceleration of cash receipts under its receivable securitization facilities.  The Company records current and/or deferred U.S. taxes for the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.  For certain other foreign subsidiaries, the Company considers earnings indefinitely reinvested and has not recorded any U.S. taxes. Of the cash and cash equivalents located outside the U.S., $413 was held by subsidiaries 
  for which earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested.  While based on current operating plans the Company does not foresee a need to repatriate these funds, if such earnings were repatriated the Company would be required to record any incremental U.S. taxes on the repatriated funds.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had $1,052 of borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facility, equal to the total facility of $1,200 less borrowings of $106 and $42 of outstanding standby letters of credit.  The Company could have borrowed this amount at September 30, 2016 and would still have been in compliance with its leverage ratio covenants.   

Capital Resources 
    
  As of    September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately $144 of capital commitments primarily related to its Americas and European Beverage segments.  The Company expects to fund these commitments primarily through cash flows generated from operations and to fund any excess needs through external borrowings. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016 there were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations provided within Part II, Item 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which information is incorporated herein by reference, except for the debt issuances and repayments described in    Note J    to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
    
  Information regarding the Company's commitments and contingent liabilities appears in Part I within Item 1 of this report under    Note L   , entitled  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,  to the consolidated financial statements, and in Part II within Item 1A of this report which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis   (Continued) 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions.  
    
  Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, impacting the reported results of operations and financial condition of the Company.  Part II, Item 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and    Note A    to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form  
  10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2015 describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in the preparation of the  consolidated  financial  statements.   There  have  been  no  significant  changes  in  the Company's critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2016.  The discussion below supplements the discussion from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to goodwill.  
    
    Goodwill Impairment 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the European Aerosols and Specialty Packaging reporting unit was 23% higher than its carrying value.  The reporting unit operates in a low-growth environment with multiple competitors, which could result in lower selling prices.  In addition, shifts in consumer demand could result in lower volumes.  While the Company believes current Adjusted EBITDA projections are reasonable, the reporting unit s ability to maintain or grow Adjusted EBITDA could be negatively impacted by the above factors.  If Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 10%, the fair value of the reporting unit would approximate carrying value. To the extent future operating results were to decline, causing the estimated fair value to fall below carrying value, it is possible that an impairment charge of up to $91 could be recorded.  In addition, the Company's North America Food reporting unit has been negatively impacted by lower sales unit volume and lower customer pricing.  The reporting unit operates in a low-growth environment with multiple competitors.  If operations continue to decline, it is possible that an impairment charge of up to $115 could be recorded.   
    
    Forward Looking Statements 
    
  Statements included herein in  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  including, but not limited to, in the discussions of asbestos in    Note K    and commitments and contingencies in     Note L    to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and also in Part I, Item 1:  Business  and Item 3:  Legal Proceedings  and in Part II, Item 7:  Management's Discussion and Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  within the Company's  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31, 2015,  which are not historical  facts  (including  any  statements  concerning  plans  and  objectives  of  management for  capacity additions, share repurchases, dividends, future operations or economic performance, or assumptions related thereto), are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the Company and its representatives may, from time to time, make oral or written statements which are also  forward-looking statements.  
    
  These forward-looking statements are made based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Company and, therefore, involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.     
    
  While the Company periodically reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition in connection with the preparation of  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and certain other sections contained in the Company's quarterly, annual or other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the Company does not intend to review or revise any particular forward-looking statement in light of future events.     
    
  A discussion of important factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the Company to differ from expectations has been set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 within Part II, Item 7:  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  under the caption  Forward Looking Statements  and is incorporated herein by reference.  Some of the factors are also discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in prior Company filings with the SEC.  In addition, other factors have been or may be discussed from time to time in the Company's SEC filings.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  In the normal course of business the Company is subject to risk from adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates and commodity prices.  The Company manages these risks through a program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily swaps and forwards. Counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  These instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The extent to which the Company uses such instruments is dependent upon its access to these contracts in the financial markets and its success in using other methods, such as netting exposures in the same currencies to mitigate foreign exchange risk and using sales arrangements that permit the pass-through of commodity prices and foreign exchange rate risks to customers.  The Company's objective in managing its exposure to market risk is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flow. For further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments and their fair values at September 30, 2016, see    Note H    to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $1.3 billion principal floating interest rate debt. A change of 0.25% in these floating interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately $3 million before tax. 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation and as of the end of the quarter for which this report is made, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  Disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information to be disclosed in reports that the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and terms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There has been no change in internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
