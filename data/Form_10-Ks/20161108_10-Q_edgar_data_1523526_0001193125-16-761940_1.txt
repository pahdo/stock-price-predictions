Canada.     

(3)  
  An affiliated fund that is managed by an affiliate of SIC Advisors LLC also holds an investment in this security.     

(4)  
  Security is non-income producing.     

(5)  
  The investment is not a qualifying asset under Section 55 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  1940 Act ), as amended. Non-qualifying assets represent
13.0% of the Company s portfolio at fair value.     

(6)  
  The investment has an unfunded commitment as of September 30, 2016. For further details see Note 11. Fair value includes an analysis of the unfunded commitment.

(7)  
  The interest rate on these loans is subject to a base rate plus 3 Month  3M  LIBOR, which at September 30, 2016 was 0.85%. As the interest rate is subject to
a minimum LIBOR floor which was greater than the 3M LIBOR rate at September 30, 2016, the prevailing rate in effect at September 30, 2016 was the base rate plus the LIBOR floor.     

(8)  
  The interest rate on these loans is subject to a base rate plus 1 Month  1M  LIBOR, which at September 30, 2016 was 0.53%. As the interest rate is subject to
a minimum LIBOR floor which was greater than the 1M LIBOR rate at September 30, 2016, the prevailing rate in effect at September 30, 2016 was the base rate plus the LIBOR floor.     

(10)  
  This investment is in the  equity  class of a CLO security. The CLO equity investments are entitled to recurring distributions which are generally equal to
the excess cash flow generated from the underlying investments after payment of the contractual payments to debt holders and fund expenses. The estimated yield is based on the current projections of this excess cash flow taking into account
assumptions which have been made regarding expected prepayments, losses and future reinvestment rates. These assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated. Ultimately, the actual yield may be higher or lower than the estimated yield if actual
results differ from those used for the assumptions.     

(14)  
  The interest rate on these loans is subject to a base rate plus 6 Month  6M  LIBOR, which at September 30, 2016 was 1.24%. As the interest rate is subject to
a minimum LIBOR floor which was greater than the 6M LIBOR rate at September 30, 2016, the prevailing rate in effect at September 30, 2016 was the base rate plus the LIBOR floor.     

(16)  
  Control Investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or maintains greater than
50% of the board representation.              See

    SIERRA INCOME CORPORATION    
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
   September 30, 2016        (unaudited)        Note 1. Organization    
  Sierra Income Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on
June 13, 2011 and formally commenced operations on April 17, 2012. The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC )
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  1940 Act ). The Company is externally managed by SIC Advisors LLC ( SIC Advisors ), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
 Advisers Act ). SIC Advisors is a majority owned subsidiary of Medley LLC, which is controlled by Medley Management Inc., a publicly traded asset management firm (NYSE: MDLY), which in turn is controlled by Medley Group LLC, an entity
wholly-owned by the senior professionals of Medley LLC. The term  Medley  refers to the collective activities of Medley Capital LLC, Medley LLC, Medley Management Inc., Medley Group LLC, SIC Advisors, associated investment funds and their
respective affiliates. The Company has elected and intends to continue to qualify to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company ( RIC ) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  Code ). The Company s fiscal year-end is December 31st.      On April 17, 2012, the Company
successfully reached its minimum escrow requirement and officially commenced operations by issuing 1,108,033 shares of common stock to SIC Advisors for gross proceeds of $10,000,000. The Company s offering period is currently scheduled to
terminate on April 17, 2017, unless further extended. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has sold a total of 93,716,607 shares of common stock, which includes shares issued as part of the distribution reinvestment plan (see Note 13), for
total proceeds of $956 million, which includes the shares sold to SIC Advisors. The proceeds from the issuance of common stock are presented in the Company s consolidated statements of changes in net assets and consolidated statements of cash
flows and are presented net of selling commissions and dealer manager fees.      On August 15, 2013, the Company formed Arbor
Funding LLC ( Arbor ), a wholly-owned financing subsidiary (see Note 5).      On June 18, 2014, the Company formed
Alpine Funding LLC ( Alpine ), a wholly-owned financing subsidiary (see Note 6).     The Company has formed and expects
to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries (the  Taxable Subsidiaries ), which are taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to hold equity securities of portfolio
companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code.      The
Company s investment objective is to generate current income, and to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Company intends to meet its investment objective by investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies with
a focus on senior secured debt, second lien debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt. The Company will originate transactions sourced through SIC Advisors  direct origination network, and also expects to acquire debt securities through
the secondary market. The Company may make equity investments in companies that it believes will generate appropriate risk adjusted returns, although it does not expect such investments to be a substantial portion of the portfolio.   
   Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies        Basis of Presentation       The Company follows the accounting and reporting
guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946   Financial Services, Investment Companies ( ASC   
         F-26

Table of Contents  

946 ). The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) and includes the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alpine, Arbor, and the Taxable Subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and related financial information have been prepared pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures
accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial results included herein contain all adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the
fair presentation of financial statements for the periods included herein. Therefore, this  Form 10-Q  should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on
 Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 9, 2016. The current period s results of
operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents    
  The Company considers cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments or investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in a money market account. The Company deposits its cash in a financial institution which, at times, may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.   
   Offering Costs       Offering
costs incurred directly by the Company are expensed in the period incurred. See Note 7 regarding offering costs paid for by SIC Advisors.   
   Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
   Deferred Financing Costs    
  Financing costs, incurred in connection with the Company s credit facilities (see Note 6), are deferred and amortized over the life
of each facility, respectively.       Indemnification       In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual agreements that provide general indemnifications against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of
individual obligations under such agreements. The Company has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to such agreements. The Company s individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that
may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on management s experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.       Revenue Recognition       Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts, is recorded on an accrual basis. The Company records amortized or accreted discounts or premiums as interest income using the effective interest method. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the
extent that the Company expects to collect such amount.   
         F-27

Table of Contents  

   Fee income associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income in
the period that the Company becomes entitled to such fees. Other fees related to loan administration requirements are capitalized as deferred revenue and recorded into income over the respective period.   
  Prepayment penalties received by the Company for debt instruments paid back to the Company prior to the maturity date are recorded as
income upon receipt.      The Company holds debt and preferred equity investments that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK )
interest provision. PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. PIK
interest is not accrued if the Company does not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company earned $236,353 and $3,722,884 in PIK interest,
respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company earned $511,922 and $1,182,080 in PIK interest, respectively.      Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost
basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $11,844,083 in realized losses related to certain non-cash restructuring
transactions, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net realized gain/(loss) from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments. The Company reports changes in fair value of investments that are measured at
fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. For total return swap transactions (see Note 5), periodic payments are received or made at the end of
each settlement period, but prior to settlement are recorded as realized gains or losses on total return swap in the consolidated statements of operations.      Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on
management s designation of non-accrual status. Accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending
upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current, although the Company may make
exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. At September 30, 2016, eight portfolio investments were on non-accrual status with a cost of $38,207,830 and a fair value of $20,853,448
or 2.21% of the fair value of the Company s portfolio. At December 31, 2015, three portfolio investments were on non-accrual status with a cost of $21,485,015 and a fair value of $9,902,391 or 1.09% of the fair value of the Company s
portfolio.      Interest income from investments in the  equity  class of a CLO security (typically subordinated notes)
is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40,  Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets . We monitor the expected cash flows from
these investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically.       Investment
Classification       The Company classifies its investments in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940
Act, the Company would be deemed to  control  a portfolio company if it owns more than 25% of its outstanding voting securities and/or had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. The Company
refers to such investments in portfolio companies that it  controls  as  Controlled Investments.  Under the 1940 Act, the Company would be deemed to be an  Affiliated Person  of a portfolio company if it owns at least
5%, but no more than 25%, of the portfolio company s outstanding voting securities or if it is under common control with such portfolio company. The Company refers to such investments in Affiliated Persons as  Affiliated Investments.

    Valuation of Investments       The Company applies fair value accounting to all of its financial instruments in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 820    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ).
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value, based on
the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 4. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an
entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the
measurement date.          Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such
market quotations, which are generally obtained from an independent pricing service or multiple broker-dealers or market makers. The Company weighs the use of third-party broker quotations, if any, in determining fair value based on
management s understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer. However, debt investments with remaining maturities within 60 days that are
not credit impaired are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value. Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by the Company s
board of directors based upon input from management and third party valuation firms. Because these investments are illiquid and because there may not be any directly comparable companies whose financial instruments have observable market values,
these loans are valued using a fundamental valuation methodology, consistent with traditional asset pricing standards, that is objective and consistently applied across all loans and through time.   
  Investments in investment funds are valued at fair value. Fair values are generally determined utilizing the net asset value
( NAV ) supplied by, or on behalf of, management of each investment fund, which is net of management and incentive fees or allocations charged by the investment fund and is in accordance with the  practical expedient , as defined
by  ASC 820.  NAVs received by, or on behalf of, management of each investment fund are based on the fair value of the investment funds  underlying investments in accordance with policies established by management of each investment fund,
as described in each of their financial statements and offering memorandum.      The methodologies utilized by the Company in
estimating its fair value of its investments categorized as Level 3 generally fall into the following two categories:       

The  Market Approach  uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets,
liabilities, or a group of assets and liabilities, such as a business.          

The  Income Approach  converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted)
amount. When the Income Approach is used, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about those future amounts.         The Company uses third-party valuation firms to assist the board of directors in the valuation of its portfolio investments. The valuation reports generated by the third-party valuation firms consider the
evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market based information, including comparable transactions, performance multiples, and movement in yields of debt instruments, among other factors. Based on
market data obtained from the third-party valuation firms, the Company uses a combined market yield analysis and an enterprise model of valuation. In applying the market yield analysis, the value of the Company s loans is determined based upon
inputs such as the coupon rate, current market yield, interest rate spreads of similar securities, the stated value of the loan, and the length to maturity. In applying the enterprise model, the Company uses a waterfall analysis which takes into
account the specific capital structure of the   
         F-29

Table of Contents  

borrower and the related seniority of the instruments within the borrower s capital structure into consideration. To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the Company
weighs some or all of the traditional market valuation methods and factors based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value. The methodologies for performing investments may be based on, among
other things: valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations of the portfolio company, considering offers
from third parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company. For non-performing investments, the Company may estimate the
liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company s assets and liabilities using an expected recovery model. The Company may estimate the fair value of warrants based on a model such as the Black-Scholes model or simulation models or a
combination thereof.      The methodologies and information that the Company utilizes when applying the Market Approach for
performing investments includes, among other things:       

valuations of comparable public companies ( Guideline Comparable Approach ),      

recent sales of private and public comparable companies ( Guideline Comparable Approach ),      

recent acquisition prices of the company, debt securities or equity securities ( Acquisition Price Approach ),      

external valuations of the portfolio company, offers from third parties to buy the company ( Estimated Sales Proceeds Approach ),

subsequent sales made by the company of its investments ( Expected Sales Proceeds Approach  and      

estimating the value to potential buyers.         The methodologies and information that the Company utilizes when applying the Income Approach for performing investments includes:   

discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company or securities ( Discounted Cash Flow  or  DCF  Approach 
and          

Black-Scholes model or simulation models or a combination thereof (Income Approach   Option Model) with respect to the valuation of warrants.
        Over-the-counter derivative contracts, such as total return swaps (see Note 5) are fair valued using models
that measure the change in fair value of reference assets underlying the swaps offset against any fees payable to the swap counterparty. The fair values of the reference assets underlying the swaps are determined using similar methods as described
above for debt and equity investments where the Company also invests directly in such assets.      The Company undertakes a
multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available, as described below:       

the Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio investment being initially valued by the valuation professionals;

conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management; and      

an independent valuation firm engaged by the Company s board of directors prepares an independent valuation report for approximately one-third of
the portfolio investments each quarter on a rotating quarterly basis on non-fiscal year-end quarters, such that each of these investments will be valued by an independent valuation firm at least twice per annum when combined with the fiscal year-end
review of all the investments by independent valuation firms.      
         F-30

Table of Contents  

   In addition, all of the Company s investments are subject to the following valuation
process:       

management reviews preliminary valuations and its own independent assessment;      

the independent audit committee of the Company s board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of senior management and independent
valuation firms; and          

the Company s board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio in good
faith based on the input of SIC Advisors, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.      
  The Company s investments in subordinated notes are carried at fair value, which is based on a discounted cash flow model. The
discounted cash flow model models both the underlying collateral ( assets ) and the liabilities of the collateralized loan obligation ( CLO ) capital structure. The discounted cash flow model uses a set of assumptions including
projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rates and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated cash flows of the assets. The discounted cash flow model distributes the asset cash flows to the liability structure based on the
payment priorities and discounts them back using appropriate market discount rates based on discount rates for comparable CLOs. The assumptions are based on available market data as well as management estimates. Additional data is used to validate
the results from the discounted cash flow method, such as analysis of relevant data observed in the CLO market, review of quotes, where available, recent acquisitions and observable transactions in the subordinated notes, among other factors.
     Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market
value, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.   
   Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The carrying amounts of certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying
amounts and fair values of the Company s long-term obligations are discussed in Note 4.       U.S. Federal Income Taxes
      The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for
the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of the sum
of its investment company taxable income ( ICTI ) including PIK, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of the Company s gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for
each taxable year in order to be eligible for tax treatment under subchapter M of the Code. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions into the
next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.   
  The Company will be subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4% on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least
98% of its ordinary income in any calendar year and 98.2% of its capital gain net income for each one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year. To the extent the Company determines that its estimated current year annual
taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for U.S. federal excise tax purposes, the Company accrues U.S. federal excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned.

   The Company s Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable
corporate rates on the unrealized gains generated by the investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $206,332 and $298,827, respectively, on the
consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments and total return swap on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.   
  ICTI generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the
recognition of income and expenses. The Company may be required to recognize ICTI in certain circumstances in which it does not receive cash. For example, if the Company holds debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having
original issue discount, the Company must include in ICTI each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by the Company in the same
taxable year. The Company may also have to include in ICTI other amounts that it has not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest income and interest income from investments that have been classified as non-accrual for financial reporting
purposes. Interest income on non-accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes, but generally is recognized in ICTI. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in the Company s ICTI
for the year of accrual, the Company may be required to make a distribution to its stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements, even though the Company will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash
amount. ICTI also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.      Although the Company files federal and state tax returns, the Company s major tax jurisdiction is the United States federal jurisdiction. The Company s federal tax returns from inception-to-date
remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.      The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC
Topic 740    Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). ASC 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more likely than not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to
meet the  more likely than not  threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. There were no interest or penalties due to material uncertain income tax positions at September 30, 2016 or 2015.      The following table reflects, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the sources of the cash distributions that the Company has paid on its common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and

    Segments       The Company invests in various industries. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its investment relationships. However, because each of these investment relationships has similar
business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single investment segment. All applicable segment disclosures are included in or can be derived from the Company s consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 for further
information.       Company Investment Risk, Concentration of Credit Risk, and Liquidity Risk    
  SIC Advisors has broad discretion in making investments for the Company. Investments generally consist of debt instruments that may be
affected by business, financial market or legal uncertainties. Prices of investments may be volatile, and a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, such as domestic or international economic and political developments, may
significantly affect the results of the Company s activities and the value of its investments. In addition, the value of the Company s portfolio may fluctuate as the general level of interest rates fluctuates.   
  The value of the Company s investments in loans and bonds may be detrimentally affected to the extent, among other things, that a
borrower defaults on its obligations, there is insufficient collateral and/or there are extensive legal and other costs incurred in collecting on a defaulted loan, observable secondary or primary market yields for similar instruments issued by
comparable companies increase materially or risk premiums required in the market between smaller companies, such as the Company s borrowers, and those for which market yields are observable, increase materially.   
  The Company s assets may, at any time, include securities and other financial instruments or obligations that are illiquid or thinly
traded, making purchase or sale of such securities and financial instruments at desired prices or in desired quantities difficult. Furthermore, the sale of any such investments may be possible only at substantial discounts, and it may be extremely
difficult to value any such investments accurately.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  In August, 2014, the FASB released Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40) ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires the Company to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going
concern within the one year period subsequent to the date that the financial statements are issued or within the one year period subsequent the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for fiscal
periods ending after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company has not elected to early adopt ASU 2014-15 and is considering its effects upon the financial statements.   
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07  Fair Value Measurements: Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entitles that Calculate Net
Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent) . The pronouncement removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using NAV per share practical expedient. The pronouncement also
removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to the investments for which the entity has not
elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. For public business entities, the guidance becomes effective and will be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those
years; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to adopt the pronouncement, therefore the Company excluded all investments in affiliated entities fair valued using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy.

   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest
 (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires that the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Prior to adoption, the Company
recorded deferred debt issuance costs as deferred financing costs as an asset on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified all of these costs as unamortized debt issuance costs that reduce debt in
the liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and retrospectively reclassified $3,239,404 of deferred debt issuance costs that were previously presented as deferred financing costs as an asset as of December 31, 2015.

  Nomida LLC ( Nomida ) is a non-public real estate investment formed by the Company to purchase and develop a residential property. The Company is the sole
equity shareholder of Nomida and has provided 100% of the debt financing to the entity. The Company acts as Nomida s sole member responsible for Nomida s daily operations. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the
Company also serves as President of Nomida. The assets of Nomida are comprised of a residential development property in the city of Chicago, IL and the proceeds of the loan from the Company; the liabilities of Nomida consist of the loan payable to
the Company.

GALIC, the Company does not have operational control over the Sierra JV for purposes of the 1940 Act or otherwise.        In connection with certain of the Company s investments, the Company receives warrants which are obtained for the objective of increasing the total investment returns and are not held for hedging
purposes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total fair value of warrants were $0 and $2,192,893, respectively, and were included in investments at fair value on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. Total
realized and change in unrealized gains (losses) related to warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $(790,778) and $(790,778), and $(206,248) and $(975,124), respectively, and were recorded on the consolidated statement
of operations in those accounts. Total realized and unrealized gains related to warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $0 and $0, and $(570,776) and $1,427, respectively, and were recorded on the consolidated statement
of operations in those accounts. The warrants are received in connection with individual investments and are not subject to master netting arrangements.      As of September 30, 2016, the Company held loans it has made directly to 66 investee companies with aggregate principal amounts of $851.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company held loans it has
made directly to 66 investee companies with aggregate principal amounts of $835.8 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made 16 and 45 loans to investee companies, respectively, with aggregate principal
amounts of $96.1 million and $232.3 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company made 4 and 22 loans to investee companies, respectively, with aggregate principal amounts of $75.7 million and
$345.4 million, respectively. The details of the Company s loans have been disclosed on the consolidated schedule of investments as well as in Note 4.

   In addition to the loans that the Company has provided, the Company has unfunded commitments
to provide additional financings through undrawn term loans or revolving lines of credit. The details of such arrangements are disclosed in Note 11.       Sierra Senior Loan Strategy JV I LLC       On March 27, 2015, the Company and
GALIC entered into a limited liability company operating agreement to co-manage Sierra JV. All portfolio and other material decisions regarding Sierra JV must be submitted to Sierra JV s board of managers, which is comprised of four members,
two of whom are selected by the Company and the other two are selected by GALIC. The Company has concluded that it does not operationally control Sierra JV. As the Company does not operationally control Sierra JV, it does not consolidate the
operations of Sierra JV within the consolidated financial statements. As a practical expedient, the Company uses NAV to determine the value of its investment in Sierra JV; therefore, this investment has been presented as a reconciling item within
the fair value hierarchy (see Note 4).      As of September 30, 2016, Sierra JV had total capital commitments of
$100 million with the Company providing $87.5 million and GALIC providing $12.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, Sierra JV had total capital commitments of $100 million with the Company providing $87.5 million and
GALIC providing $12.5 million. Approximately $61.9 million and $39.2 million was funded as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, relating to these commitments, of which $54.2 million and
$34.3 million were from the Company, respectively. The Company does not have the right to withdraw any of their respective capital commitment, unless in connection with a transfer of its membership interests. The Company may transfer full
membership interests as long as it is approved by all members and transferred in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or applicable state securities laws.   
  On August 4, 2015, Sierra JV entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the  JV Facility ) led by Credit Suisse,
AG with commitments of $100 million subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. On December 29, 2015, the JV Facility was amended and the total commitments were increased to $135 million. The JV Facility will bear interest at a rate of
LIBOR (with no minimum) + 2.50% per annum. The revolving loan period ends on December 29, 2018 and the final maturity date is December 29, 2020. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $120.7 million and $52.7 million outstanding
under the JV Facility, respectively.      As of September 30, 2016, Sierra JV consisted of investments in 35 portfolio companies
with a fair value of $159.4 million and was comprised of 99.1% of senior secured first lien term loans and 0.9% preferred equity. As of December 31, 2015, Sierra JV consisted of investments in 17 portfolio companies with a fair value of $88.2
million and was comprised of 100.0% of senior secured first lien term loans.      The following table shows a summary of Sierra

    Note 4. Fair Value Measurements    
  The Company follows ASC 820 for measuring the fair value of portfolio investments. Fair value is the price that would be received in the
sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or
parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the
instruments or market and the instruments  complexity. The Company s fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Financial investments recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial
statements are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the
investment as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from this hierarchy:   

Level 1   Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.

Level 2   Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable at the measurement date. This category includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets including actionable bids from third
parties for privately held assets or liabilities, and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as yield curves and forward currency rates that are entered directly into valuation models to determine the value of derivatives or other assets or
liabilities.          

Level 3   Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and where there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. The inputs
for the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation and is based upon management s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. These
investments include debt and equity investments in private companies or assets valued using the Market or Income Approach and may involve pricing models whose inputs require significant judgment or estimation because of the absence of any meaningful
current market data for identical or similar investments. The inputs in these valuations may include, but are not limited to, capitalization and discount rates, beta and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization
( EBITDA ) multiples. The information may also include pricing information or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing
and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence.         In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company employs the valuation policy approved by the board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820 (see Note 2). Consistent with
the Company s valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which the Company s investments are trading, in determining fair value.

   Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the
reporting period in which they occur. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $25,078,656 in transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in observable inputs in market data. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company recorded $8,332,638 in transfers to Level 3 from Level 2 due to a decrease in observable inputs in market data and no other transfers between levels.

    Represents amounts used when the Company has determined that market participants would use such multiples when measuring the fair value of these
investments.         The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s
debt and derivative investments are market yields. Increases in market yields would result in lower fair value measurements.   
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s warrants/equity investments are comparable
company multiples of Revenue or EBITDA for the latest twelve months ( LTM ), next twelve months ( NTM ) or a reasonable period a market participant would consider. Increases in EBITDA multiples in isolation would result in higher
fair value measurement.       Note 5. Total Return Swap       On August 27, 2013, the Company, through its wholly-owned financing subsidiary, Arbor, entered into a total return swap ( TRS ) with Citibank, N.A. ( Citibank ) that is indexed to a
basket of loans.      The TRS with Citibank enables Arbor to obtain the economic benefit of the loans underlying the TRS, despite
the fact that such loans will not be directly held or otherwise owned by Arbor, in return for an interest-type payment to Citibank.      SIC Advisors acts as the investment manager of Arbor and has discretion over the composition of the basket of loans underlying the TRS. The terms of the TRS are governed by an ISDA 2002 Master Agreement,
the Schedule thereto and Credit Support Annex to such Schedule, and the Confirmation exchanged thereunder, between Arbor and Citibank, which collectively establish the TRS, and are collectively referred to herein as the  TRS Agreement . On
March 21, 2014, Arbor amended and restated its Confirmation Letter Agreement (the  Amended Confirmation Agreement ) with Citibank. The Amended Confirmation Agreement increased the maximum market value (determined at the time each such loan
becomes subject to the TRS) of the portfolio of loans that Arbor may select from $200,000,000, and increased the interest rate payable to Citibank from LIBOR plus 1.30% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum. Other than the foregoing, the Amended
Confirmation Agreement did not change any of the other terms of the TRS.      On July 23, 2014, Arbor entered into the Second
Amended and Restated Confirmation Letter Agreement (the  Second Amended Confirmation Agreement ) with Citibank. The Second Amended Confirmation Agreement increased the maximum market value (determined at the time each such loan becomes
subject to the TRS) of the portfolio of loans that Arbor may select from $200,000,000 to $350,000,000. Other than the foregoing, the Second Amended Confirmation Agreement did not change any of the other terms of the TRS.   
  On June 8, 2015, Arbor entered into the Third Amended and Restated Confirmation Letter Agreement (the  Third Amended Confirmation
Agreement ) with Citibank. The Third Amended Confirmation Agreement   
         F-50

Table of Contents  

decreased the maximum market value (determined at the time each such loan becomes subject to the TRS) of the portfolio of loans that Arbor may select from $350,000,000 to $300,000,000. Other than
the foregoing, the Third Amended Confirmation Agreement did not change any of the other terms of the TRS.      On March 21,
2016, Arbor entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Confirmation Letter Agreement (the  Fourth Amended Confirmation Agreement ) with Citibank. The Fourth Amended Confirmation Agreement extended the term of the TRS from March 21,
2016 through March 21, 2019 and increased the interest rate payable to Citi from LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.65% per annum. Other than the foregoing, the Fourth Amended Confirmation Agreement did not change any of the
other terms of the TRS.      Pursuant to the terms of the TRS Agreement, as amended and subject to conditions customary for
transactions of this nature, Arbor may select a portfolio of loans with a maximum market value (determined at the time each such loan becomes subject to the TRS) of $300,000,000, which is also referred to as the maximum notional amount of the TRS.
Arbor receives from Citibank a periodic payment on set dates that is based upon any coupons, both earned and accrued, generated by the loans underlying the TRS, subject to limitations described in the Amended TRS Agreement as well as any fees
associated with the loans included in the portfolio. Arbor pays to Citibank interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.65% per annum. In addition, upon the termination or repayment of any loan subject to the TRS, Arbor either receives from
Citibank the appreciation in the value of such loan, or pays to Citibank any depreciation in the value of such loan.      Citibank
may terminate the TRS on or after the second anniversary of the effectiveness of the TRS. SIC Advisors may terminate the TRS on behalf of Arbor at any time upon providing 10 days prior notice to Citibank. Any termination by SIC Advisors on behalf of
Arbor prior to the second anniversary of the effectiveness of the TRS will result in payment of an early termination fee to Citibank. The early termination fee shall equal the present value of the following two cash flows: (a) interest payments at a
rate equal 1.65% based on 70% of the maximum notional amount of $300,000,000, payable from the later of the first anniversary of the effectiveness of the TRS or the termination date until the second anniversary of the effectiveness of the TRS and
(b) interest payments at a rate equal to 0.15% based on the maximum notional amount of $300,000,000, payable from the later of the first anniversary of the effectiveness of the TRS or the termination date until the second anniversary of the
effectiveness of the TRS.      Arbor is required to pay a minimum usage fee in connection with the TRS of 1.65% on the amount
equal to 85% of the average daily unused portion of the maximum amount permitted under the TRS. Such minimum usage fee will not apply during the first 365 days and last 60 days of the term of the TRS. Arbor will also pay Citibank customary fees in
connection with the establishment and maintenance of the TRS. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Arbor paid $193,194 and $534,170, respectively, in minimum usage fees, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of
operations as net realized gain on total return swap. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Arbor paid $60,864 and $492,293, respectively, in minimum usage fees, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations as
net realized gain on total return swap.      Arbor is required to initially cash collateralize a specified percentage of each loan
(generally 25% to 35% of the market value of such loan) included under the TRS in accordance with margin requirements described in the Amended TRS Agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Arbor has posted $79,010,146 and
$77,029,970, respectively, in collateral to Citibank in relation to the TRS which is recorded on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as cash collateral on total return swap. Arbor may be required to post additional collateral from
time to time as a result of a decline in the mark-to-market value of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS. The obligations of Arbor under the Amended TRS Agreement are non-recourse to the Company and the Company s exposure under the
Amended TRS Agreement is limited to the value of the Company s investment in Arbor, which generally equals the value of cash collateral provided by Arbor under the Amended TRS Agreement.   
         F-51

Table of Contents  

   In connection with the TRS, Arbor has made customary representations and warranties and is
required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar transactions. In addition to customary events of default and termination events included in the form ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, the
Amended TRS Agreement contains the following termination events: (a) a failure to satisfy the portfolio criteria for at least 30 days; (b) a failure to post initial cash collateral or additional collateral as required by the Amended TRS Agreement;
(c) a default by Arbor or the Company with respect to indebtedness in an amount equal to or greater than the lesser of $10,000,000 and 2% of the Company s NAV at such time; (d) a merger of Arbor or the Company meeting certain criteria; (e) the
Company or Arbor amending their respective constituent documents to alter their investment strategy in a manner that has or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; and (f) SIC Advisors ceasing to be the investment manager of
Arbor or to have authority to enter into transactions under the Amended TRS Agreement on behalf of Arbor, and not being replaced by an entity reasonably acceptable to Citibank. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have
any derivatives with contingent features in net liability positions; therefore, if a trigger event had occurred, no amount would have been required to be posted by the Company.   
  The Company s maximum credit risk exposure as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is $79,010,146 and $78,523,223,
respectively, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as cash collateral on total return swap and receivable due on total return swap.      The Company s receivable from Citibank, represents realized amounts from payments on underlying loans in the total return swap portfolio which as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0
and $1,493,253, respectively, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as receivable due on total return swap. The Company does not offset collateral posted in relation to the TRS with any unrealized appreciation or
depreciation outstanding in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
  Transactions in total return swap contracts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in $761,010 and $4,845,649
in realized gains/(losses) and $5,159,214 and $9,188,445 in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation), respectively, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. Transactions in total return swap contracts during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015 resulted in $3,607,072 and $9,227,421 in realized gains/(losses) and $(11,757,134) and $(11,065,966) in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation), respectively, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of
operations.      The Company only held one derivative position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which is and was
subject to a Master Agreements ( MA ). The following table represents the Company s gross and net amounts after offset under the MA of the derivative assets and liabilities presented by derivative type net of the related collateral

    Note 6. Borrowings    
   
    As a BDC, the Company is only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that its asset coverage, as
defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. The amount of leverage that the Company employs at any time depends on its assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.
     The fair value of the Company s debt obligation is determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in
terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Company s margin borrowings are estimated based
upon market interest rates for its own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. The Company s debt obligation is recorded at its carrying value, which approximates fair value.   
    ING Credit Facility        On August 12, 2016, the Company amended its existing senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility (the  ING Credit Facility ) pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the
 Revolving Credit Agreement ) with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING Credit Facility matures on August 12, 2020 and is secured by substantially all of the Company s
assets, subject to certain exclusions as further set forth in an Amended and Restated Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement (the  Security Agreement ) entered into in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, among the Company,
the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto, ING Capital LLC, as Administrative Agent, each Financial Agent and Designated Indebtedness Holder party thereto and ING Capital LLC, as Collateral Agent. The ING Credit Facility also includes usual and
customary representations, covenants and events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this nature. On February 13, 2015, commitments to the ING credit facility were expanded from $150,000,000 to $170,000,000. On August
12, 2016, commitments to the ING credit facility were expanded from $170,000,000 to $175,000,000.      The ING Credit Facility
allows for the Company, at its option, to borrow money at a rate of either (i) an alternate base rate plus 1.50% per annum or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. The interest rate margins are subject to certain step-downs upon the satisfaction of
certain conditions described in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The alternate base rate will be the greatest of (i) the U.S. Prime Rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and (iii) three month
LIBOR plus 1%. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the commitment under the ING Credit Facility was $175,000,000 and $170,000,000, respectively, and the ING Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for potential future
expansion of the ING Credit Facility up to a total of $500,000,000. Availability of loans under the ING Credit Facility is linked to the valuation of the collateral pursuant to a borrowing base mechanism.

   The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders based on the daily
unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the ING Credit Facility. The commitment fee is (i) 1.50% if the used portion of the aggregate commitments is less than or equal to 40%, (ii) 0.75% if the used portion of the aggregate commitments is
greater than 40% and less than or equal to 65% or (iii) 0.50% if the used portion of the aggregate commitments is greater than 65%. The ING Credit Facility provides that the Company may use the proceeds of the facility for general corporate
purposes, including making investments in accordance with the Company s investment objective and strategy.      Borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Agreement are subject to, among other things, a minimum borrowing base. Substantially all of the Company s assets are pledged as collateral under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The ING Credit Facility requires the
Company to, among other things (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well the Company s business and operations, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) agree to comply with
various affirmative and negative covenants. The documents for the Revolving Credit Agreement also include default provisions, such as the failure to make timely payments under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the occurrence of a change in control,
and the failure by the Company to materially perform under the operative agreements governing the Revolving Credit Agreement, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the Revolving Credit Agreement, thereby materially and
adversely affecting the Company s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.      In connection with the
security interest established under the Security Agreement, the Company, ING Capital LLC, in its capacity as collateral agent, and State Street Bank and Trust Company, in its capacity as the Company s custodian, entered into a control agreement
dated as of December 4, 2013, in order to, among other things, perfect the security interest granted pursuant to the Security Agreement in, and provide for control over, the related collateral.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the Company s borrowings under the ING Credit Facility
approximated their fair value. The fair value of the Company s debt obligation is determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Company s borrowing under the ING Credit Facility is estimated based upon market interest rates of the Company s borrowing or entities with
similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the ING Credit Facility would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined in Note 4.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2,935,814 and $1,061,595 of financing costs related to the ING Credit Facility have been
capitalized and are being amortized over the respective terms, respectively. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, the financing costs related to the ING Credit Facility are reported on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as a direct
deduction from the face amount of the revolving credit facility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $1,251,792 and $3,638,315, respectively, of interest and financing expenses related to the ING Credit

     Alpine Credit Facility     
  On July 23, 2014, the Company s, wholly-owned, special purpose financing subsidiary, Alpine, entered into a revolving credit facility
(the  Alpine Credit Facility ) pursuant to a Loan Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ( JPMorgan ), as administrative agent and lender, the Financing Providers from time to time party thereto, SIC Advisors,
as the portfolio manager, and the Collateral Administrator, Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary party thereto (the  Loan Agreement ). Alpine s obligations to JPMorgan under the Alpine Credit Facility are secured by a first
priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Alpine, including its portfolio of loans. The obligations of Alpine under the Alpine Credit Facility are non-recourse to the Company.   
  The Alpine Credit Facility provides for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount up to $300,000,000 on a committed basis. Borrowings
under the Alpine Credit Facility are subject to compliance with a NAV coverage ratio with respect to the current value of Alpine s portfolio and various eligibility criteria must be satisfied with respect to the initial acquisition of each loan
in Alpine s portfolio. Any amounts borrowed under the Alpine Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on July 23, 2019.   
  Pricing under the Alpine Credit Facility for each one month calculation period is based on LIBOR for an interest period of one month,
plus a spread of 3.25% per annum. If LIBOR is unavailable, pricing will be determined at the prime rate offered by JPMorgan or the federal funds effective rate, plus a spread of 3.25% per annum. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Since February
23, 2015, Alpine has been required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.50% on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments to the extent $150,000,000 has not been borrowed. Alpine also paid a set-up fee and incurred certain other
customary costs and expenses in connection with obtaining the Alpine Credit Facility on July 23, 2014, and its first amendment which increased the aggregate principal amount from $150,000,000 to $300,000,000 on February 6, 2015.  
  Borrowings of Alpine are considered borrowings of the Company for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the
1940 Act applicable to business development companies.      Pursuant to a Sale and Contribution Agreement entered into between the
Company and Alpine (the  Sale Agreement ) in connection with the Alpine Credit Facility, the Company may sell loans or contribute cash or loans to Alpine from time to time and will retain a residual interest in any assets contributed
through its ownership of Alpine or will receive fair market value for any assets sold to Alpine. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to repurchase certain loans sold to Alpine. In addition to the acquisition of loans pursuant to the
Sale Agreement, Alpine may purchase additional assets from various sources. Alpine has appointed SIC Advisors to manage its portfolio of assets pursuant to the terms of a Portfolio Management Agreement between SIC Advisors and Alpine.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the Company s borrowings under the Alpine Credit Facility
approximated the fair value of the Company s debt obligation. The fair value of the Company s debt obligation is determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Company s borrowings under the Alpine Credit Facility is estimated based upon market interest rates
of the Company s borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Alpine Credit Facility would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined in Note 4.
     As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,740,575 and $2,177,809, respectively, of financing costs related to the
Alpine Credit Facility have been capitalized and are being amortized over the respective terms. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, the financing costs related to the Alpine Credit Facility are reported on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and
Liabilities as a direct deduction from the face amount of the revolving credit facility. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $2,518,536 and

   Note 7. Agreements    
    Investment Advisory Agreement        On April 5, 2012, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement ( IAA ) with SIC Advisors to manage the Company s investment activities. The IAA became effective as of April 17,
2012, the date that the Company met its minimum offering requirement. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, the initial term of the IAA was for two years from its effective date, with one-year renewals subject to approval by the Company s board of
directors, a majority of whom must be independent directors. On March 2, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved the renewal of the IAA for an additional one-year term at an in-person meeting. Pursuant to the IAA, SIC Advisors
implements the Company s business strategy on a day-to-day basis and performs certain services for the Company, subject to oversight by the Company s board of directors. SIC Advisors is responsible for, among other duties, determining
investment criteria, sourcing, analyzing and executing investment transactions, asset sales, financings and performing asset management duties. Under the IAA, the Company has agreed to pay SIC Advisors a management fee for investment advisory and
management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee.      The base management fee is calculated at an
annual rate of 1.75% of the Company s gross assets payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, the term  gross assets  includes any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage.  Gross
assets  also includes any cash collateral posted with respect to the TRS, adjusted for realized and unrealized appreciation. For the first quarter of the Company s operations, the base management fee was calculated based on the initial
value of the Company s gross assets. Subsequently, the base management fee is calculated based on the gross assets at the end of each completed calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial quarter are appropriately prorated.
     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an expense for base management fees of
$5,040,490 and $14,790,696, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded an expense for base management fees of $4,584,654 and $12,548,197, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a base management fee payable of $5,040,490 and 4,686,096, respectively.      The
incentive fee consists of the following two parts:      An incentive fee on net investment income ( Subordinated Incentive Fee
on Income ) is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and is based upon pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter. No Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income is payable in any calendar quarter in which
pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed a quarterly return to stockholders of 1.75% per quarter on the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (the  Preferred Quarterly
Return ). All pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Quarterly Return, but is   
         F-61

Table of Contents  

less than or equal to 2.1875% of net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter in any quarter, will be payable to SIC Advisors. The Company refers to this portion of its
Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income as the  Catch Up . It is intended to provide an incentive fee of 20% on pre-incentive fee net investment income when pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.1875% of net assets at the end of
the immediately preceding quarter in any quarter. For any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.1875% of net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, the Subordinated Incentive Fee on
Income shall equal 20% of the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income, because the Preferred Quarterly Return and Catch Up will have been achieved. There is no incentive fee on net investment income earned on the TRS.   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income of $2,372,355 and
$7,876,060, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income of $246,192 and $2,639,084, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
recorded an incentive fee on net income payable of $2,372,355 and $1,795,268, respectively.      A capital gains incentive fee
will be earned on realized investments and shall be payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year during which the IAA is in effect. If the IAA is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of such termination.
The fee equals 20% of the realized capital gains, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. The incentive fee on capital gains is equal to realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, computed net
of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis.      Under GAAP, the Company calculates
capital gains incentive fees as if the Company had realized all assets at their fair values and liabilities at their settlement amounts as of the reporting date. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual assume the cumulative
aggregate unrealized capital appreciation is realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not payable under the IAA. Accordingly, the Company accrues a provisional capital gains incentive fee taking into account any unrealized gains
or losses. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future and that the provisional capital gains incentive fee will become payable.   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a capital gains incentive fee of $0 and $0, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a capital gains incentive fee of $0 and $0, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a capital gains incentive fee payable of $0
and $0, respectively.      Prior to June 2, 2014, SIC Advisors bore all organizational and offering expenses, as defined in the
IAA, on behalf of the Company until the Company s gross proceeds in connection with the sale of its common stock exceeded $300,000,000. Beginning June 2, 2014, the Company became responsible for all ongoing organization and offering expenses.
     Pursuant to the terms of the IAA, the Company has agreed to reimburse SIC Advisors for any such organizational and offering
expenses incurred by SIC Advisors ( O O Reimbursable Expenses ) prior to June 2, 2014 not to exceed 1.25% of the gross subscriptions raised by the Company over the course of the offering period, which is currently scheduled to
terminate April 17, 2017, unless further extended.      In the event that other organizational and offering expenses exceed 5.25%
of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to its public offering or one or more private offerings at the time of the completion of the offering or other organizational and offering expenses, together
with selling commissions, dealer manager fees and any discounts paid to members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, exceed 15% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to its public
offering or one or more private offerings at the time of the completion of the offering, then SIC

Advisors shall be required to pay without reimbursement from the Company, or, if already paid by the Company, reimburse the Company, for amounts exceeding such 5.25% and 15% limit, as
appropriate.      As of February 2015, SIC Advisors had been fully reimbursed for all O O Reimbursable Expenses incurred since
inception, which totaled $5,602,303. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, SIC Advisors did not incur O O Reimbursable Expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not
reimburse SIC Advisors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reimbursed SIC Advisors $0 and $443,687, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no amounts have been accrued related to
O O Expenses to be reimbursed to SIC Advisors.       Administration Agreement    
  On April 5, 2012, the Company entered into an administration agreement (the  Administration Agreement ) with Medley Capital
LLC, pursuant to which Medley Capital LLC furnishes the Company with administrative services necessary to conduct its day-to-day operations. On February 28, 2013, Medley Capital LLC entered into a Sub-Administration Agreement with State Street Bank
Global Fund Accounting and Custody to perform certain financial, accounting, administrative and other services on behalf of the Company. On March 2, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved the renewal of the Administration
Agreement for an additional one-year term at an in-person meeting. Medley Capital LLC is reimbursed for administrative expenses it incurs on the Company s behalf in performing its obligations. Such costs are reasonably allocated to the Company
on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. The Company does not reimburse Medley Capital LLC for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other
administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Medley Capital LLC. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded expenses of $780,166 and $1,997,067, respectively, relating to administrator expenses.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded expenses of $531,497 and $1,625,938, respectively, relating to administrator expenses. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $780,165 and
$517,930, respectively, in administrator expenses payable.       Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement    
  On June 29, 2012, the Company entered into an Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement (the  Expense Support Agreement )
with SIC Advisors. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, SIC Advisors has agreed to reimburse the Company for operating expenses in an amount equal to the difference between distributions paid to the Company s stockholders in each month,
less the sum of the Company s net investment income, the Company s net realized capital gains and dividends paid to the Company from its portfolio companies (not included in net income and net realized capital gains) during such period
( Expense Support Reimbursement ). To the extent that no dividends or other distributions are paid to the Company s stockholders in any given month, then the Expense Support Reimbursement for such month shall be equal to such amount
necessary in order for available operating funds for the month to equal zero. The terms of the Expense Support Agreement commenced as of the date that the Company s registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. Most recently, and
subsequent to quarter end, the Company s board of directors approved an extension of the period during which SIC Advisors may reimburse the Company for operating expenses under the Expense Support Agreement to December 31, 2016. Pursuant
to the Expense Support Agreement, as amended, effective as of April 1, 2016, SIC Advisors may make expense support payments on a discretionary basis by making an election on the last day of each month to fund an expense support payment in an
amount equal to the difference between the Company s distributions paid to the Company s stockholders during such month less the sum of the Company s net investment income, the Company s net realized capital gains and dividends
paid to the Company from its portfolio companies (not included in net income and net realized capital gains) during such period.      Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation to reimburse SIC Advisors for any amounts funded by SIC Advisors under the Expense Support Agreement if, and only to the
  
         F-63

Table of Contents  

extent that, during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which SIC Advisors incurred a liability for such amount, the sum of the Company s net investment income,
the Company s net realized capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company from its portfolio companies, to the extent not included in net investment income or net realized capital gains, exceeds the
distributions paid by the Company to stockholders. The purpose of the Expense Support Agreement is to cover distributions to stockholders so as to ensure that the distributions do not constitute a return of capital for GAAP purposes and to reduce
operating expenses until the Company has raised sufficient capital to be able to absorb such expenses.      Pursuant to the
Expense Support Agreement, the Company will reimburse SIC Advisors for expense support payments it previously made following any calendar quarter for which the Company received net investment income, net realized capital gains and dividends from its
portfolio companies (not included in net income and net realized capital gains) in excess of the distributions paid to the Company s stockholders during such calendar quarter (the  Excess Operating Funds ). Any such reimbursement will
be made within three years of the date that the expense support payment obligation was incurred by SIC Advisors, subject to the conditions described below. The amount of the reimbursement during any calendar quarter will equal the lesser of
(i) the Excess Operating Funds received during the quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all expense payments made by SIC Advisors that have not yet been reimbursed. In addition, the Company will only make reimbursement payments to the
extent its current annualized  operating expense ratio  (as described in footnote 1 to the table below) is equal to or less than its operating expense ratio for the quarter during which the corresponding expense obligation was incurred and
to the extent the annualized rate of its regular cash dividends to the Company s stockholders for the month is equal to or greater than the annualized rate of the Company s regular cash distributions to stockholders for the month during
which the corresponding expense payment was incurred.      For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded net Expense Support Reimbursements of $5,389,627 and $16,093,129, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded net Expense Support Reimbursements of
$(931,048) and $3,003,964, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations. Repayments of amounts paid by SIC Advisors to the Company under the Expense Support Agreement will be accrued as they become probable and estimable. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $9,433,037 and $7,314,867, respectively, in its consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as due from affiliate relating to the Expense Support Agreement. The Company refers to
Expense Support Reimbursements that are eligible for reimbursement to SIC Advisors by virtue of having satisfied the conditions described above as a  Crystalized Reimbursement.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company recorded $135,784 and $2,461,300, respectively, of Crystalized Reimbursements, of which $0 and $1,765,769 was paid to the Company, and $135,784 and $695,533 was included in due to affiliate on the respective consolidated statements of assets
and liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total amounts eligible for reimbursement by the Company to SIC Advisors net of Crystalized Reimbursements was $32,917,254 and $16,824,125, respectively.

   Opportunities for co-investments may arise when SIC Advisors or an affiliated adviser
becomes aware of investment opportunities that may be appropriate for the Company and other clients or affiliated funds. As a BDC, the Company was substantially limited in its ability to co-invest in privately negotiated transactions with affiliated
funds until it obtained an exemptive order from the SEC on November 25, 2013 (the  Exemptive Order ). The Exemptive Order permits the Company to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates, each of whose
investment adviser is Medley LLC, the parent company of SIC Advisors, or an investment adviser controlled by Medley LLC, in a manner consistent with its investment objective, strategies and restrictions, as well as regulatory requirements and other
pertinent factors. Co-investment under the Exemptive Order is subject to certain conditions therein, including the condition that, in the case of each co-investment transaction, the Company s board of directors determines that it would be
advantageous for the Company to co-invest in a manner described in the Exemptive Order. Before receiving the Exemptive Order, the Company only participated in co-investments that were allowed under existing regulatory guidance, such as syndicated
loan transactions where price was the only negotiated term, which limited the types of investments that the Company could make. Please see footnotes 3 and 4 to the consolidated schedule of investments as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 for disclosures regarding securities also held by affiliated funds.       Note 9. Directors Fees

September 30, 2015, the Company recorded directors  fees expenses in General and Administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations of $65,000 and $174,625, respectively.   
   Note 10. Earnings Per Share       In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 260    Earnings per Share , basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis.   
  The following table shows the computation of the weighted average basic and diluted net increase in net assets per share from operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

    Note 11. Commitments       As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $10,836,932 and $14,170,243, respectively, of unfunded commitments under loan and financing agreements. These amounts are primarily composed
of commitments for senior secured term loans, revolvers, and additional capital contributions for the Sierra JV. The unrealized gain or loss associated with unfunded commitments is recorded in the financial statements and reflected as an adjustment
to the valuation of the related security in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The par amount of the unfunded commitments are not recognized by the Company until the commitment is funded.   
   
     Note 12. Fee Income       Fee income consists of origination fees, amendment fees, prepayment fees, administrative agent fees, transaction break-up fee and other miscellaneous fees. Origination fees, prepayment fees, amendment
fees, and other similar fees are non-recurring fee sources. Such fees are received on a transaction by transaction basis and do not constitute a regular stream of income. The following tables show the Company s fee income for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:       
     Note 13. Distributions and Share Repurchase Plan Distributions    
  Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by
the Company s board of directors.      The Company has adopted an  opt in  distribution reinvestment plan
( DRIP ) pursuant to which the Company s common stockholders may elect to have the full amount of any cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock. As a result, if the Company declares a cash
dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has  opted in  to the Company s reinvestment plan will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock rather than
receiving   
         F-67

cash distributions. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash
distributions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company distributed a total of $53,464,883, of which, $28,108,664 was in cash and $25,356,219 was in the form of common shares associated with the DRIP. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company distributed a total of $40,537,983, of which, $21,139,251, was in cash and $19,398,732 was in the form of common shares associated with the DRIP.   
  The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that the Company has declared or paid to its stockholders for the current
and prior fiscal years. Stockholders of record as of each respective record date were entitled to receive the distribution.       
    The Company s distributions may be funded from offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute
a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Company for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses.   
  The Company s previous distributions to stockholders may have been funded from temporary Expense Support Reimbursements that may be
subject to repayment to SIC Advisors, See Note 7. The portion of these distributions derived from temporary Expense Support Reimbursements were not based on the Company s investment performance and may not continue in the future. If SIC
Advisors had not agreed to make Expense Support Reimbursements, these distributions would have come from paid-in-capital. The reimbursement of these payments owed to SIC Advisors will reduce the future distributions to which stockholders would
otherwise be entitled.   
         F-68

Table of Contents  

   The determination of the tax attributes (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net
capital gains on the sale of securities, and/or a return of paid-in-capital surplus which is a nontaxable distribution) of distributions is made annually as of the end of the Company s fiscal year based upon its taxable income for the full year
and distributions paid for the full year.       Share Repurchase Program    
  In June 2013, the Company commenced a share repurchase program pursuant to which it intends to conduct quarterly share repurchases, of up
to 2.5% of the weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 3-month period or 10% of the weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 12-month period. The purpose of the share repurchase program is to allow stockholders to sell their
shares back to the Company at a price equal to the most recently disclosed NAV per share of the Company s common stock immediately prior to the date of repurchase. Shares will be purchased from stockholders participating in the program on a pro
rata basis. Unless the Company s board of directors determines otherwise, the number of shares to be repurchased during any calendar year will be limited to the proceeds received in association with the sale of shares of common stock under the
distribution reinvestment plan.      The following table reflects activity under the Company s Share Repurchase Plan:
      
    In the event of the death or disability of a stockholder, the Company will repurchase the shares held by
such stockholder at a price equal to the NAV per share of our shares as disclosed in the periodic report we file with the SEC immediately following the date of the death or disability of such stockholder. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,373 and 2,362, respectively, due to death. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company repurchased 2,602 and 31,060, respectively, shares due to death.

   Overview       We are an
externally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are externally managed by SIC Advisors LLC, or SIC Advisors, which is a registered investment adviser under
the Advisers Act. SIC Advisors is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. In
addition, we have qualified and intend to continue to qualify to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code.      On April 17, 2012, we successfully reached the minimum escrow requirement and officially commenced operations by receiving gross proceeds of $10 million in exchange for 1,108,033.24 shares of our
common stock sold to SIC Advisors.      Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay SIC Advisors a base management fee as well
as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we reimburse Medley for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Medley Capital LLC in performing its obligations under the
Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs.   
  We intend to meet our investment objective by primarily lending to, and investing in, the debt of privately owned U.S. middle market
companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue between $50 million and $1 billion. We intend to focus primarily on making investments in first lien senior secured debt, second lien secured debt, and to a lesser extent, subordinated
debt, of middle market companies in a broad range of industries. We expect that the majority of our debt investments will bear interest at floating interest rates, but our portfolio may also include fixed-rate investments. We will originate
transactions sourced through SIC Advisors  existing network, and, to a lesser extent, expect to acquire debt securities through the secondary market. We may make equity investments in companies that we believe will generate appropriate risk
adjusted returns, although we do not expect such investments to be a substantial portion of our portfolio.      The level of our
investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to prospective portfolio companies, the level of merger, acquisition and refinancing activity for such companies, the availability of credit to
finance transactions, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Based on prevailing market conditions, we anticipate that we will invest the proceeds from each subscription closing
generally within 30-90 days. The precise timing will depend on the availability of investment opportunities that are consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. Any distributions we make during such period may be substantially lower
than the distributions that we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested.      As a BDC, we are required to comply with
certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in  qualifying assets,  including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S.
government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, we are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, as   
         2   

Table of Contents  

defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. To obtain and maintain our RIC status, we must meet specified source-of-income and asset
diversification requirements. To be eligible for tax treatment under Subchapter M for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net
long-term capital losses, if any, for the taxable year.       Revenues    
  We generate revenue in the form of interest on the debt securities that we hold and distributions and capital gains on other interests
that we acquire in our portfolio companies. We expect that the senior debt we invest in will generally have stated terms of three to ten years and that the subordinated debt we invest in will generally have stated terms of five to ten years. Our
senior and subordinated debt investments bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In addition, some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or
PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with
transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as fee income. Dividend
income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts.       Expenses    
  Our primary annual operating expenses consist of the payment of advisory fees and the reimbursement of expenses under our Investment
Advisory Agreement with SIC Advisors and our Administration Agreement with Medley Capital LLC. We bear other expenses, which include, among other things:       

corporate, organizational and offering expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in our Investment Advisory
Agreement;          

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the related fees and cost of any third-party valuation services;      

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;      

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, monitoring our financial and legal affairs, making investments, and valuing investments,
including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;          

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;      

transfer agent and custodial fees;          

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement;      

federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees;      

federal, state and local taxes;          

independent directors  fees and expenses, including travel expenses;      

costs of director and stockholder meetings, proxy statements, stockholders  reports and notices;      

costs of fidelity bonds, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other types of insurance;      

direct costs, including those relating to printing of stockholder reports and advertising or sales materials, mailing, long distance telephone and
staff subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement;

and applicable federal and state securities laws;          

brokerage commissions for our investments;          

all other expenses incurred by us or SIC Advisors in connection with administering our investment portfolio, including expenses incurred by SIC
Advisors in performing certain of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement; and          

the reimbursement of the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, whose compensation is paid by Medley, to the extent
that each such reimbursement amount is annually approved by our independent director committee and subject to the limitations included in our Administration Agreement.          Administrative Services       We reimburse Medley Capital LLC for the
administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. However, such reimbursement is made at an amount equal to the lower of Medley Capital LLC s actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable
administrative services in the same geographic location. Also, such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. We will not reimburse Medley Capital LLC for any services for
which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Medley Capital LLC.       Portfolio and Investment Activity       As of September 30, 2016, our
investment portfolio consisted of investments in 95 portfolio companies with a fair value of $941.7 million, and was comprised of 50.4% senior secured first lien term loans, 27.6% senior secured second lien term loans, 7.9% senior secured first lien
notes, 6.5% subordinated notes, 5.6% Sierra Senior Loan Strategy JV I LLC and 2.0% warrants and equity.      As of

portfolio bore interest based on fixed rates, and 89.7% of our income-bearing portfolio bore interest on floating rates, such as LIBOR.      As of December 31, 2015, our income-bearing investment portfolio, which represented 95.1% of our total portfolio, had a weighted average yield based upon the cost of our portfolio investments of

  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we invested $86.9 million of principal in directly originated transactions across
12 portfolio companies and $9.1 million of principal in syndicated transactions across 4 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, the investment portfolio was comprised of $851.0 million of principal in directly originated

4  
      
  Investments that are performing below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination or purchase. Some loss of interest or dividend is expected, but no
loss of principal. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).

      Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement     
  On June 29, 2012, the Company entered into an Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement with SIC Advisors (the  Expense
Support Agreement ). Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, SIC Advisors has agreed to reimburse the Company for operating expenses in an amount equal to the difference between distributions paid to the Company s stockholders in each
month, less the sum of the Company s net investment income, the Company s net realized capital gains and dividends paid to the Company from its portfolio companies, not included in net income and net realized capital gains, during such
period ( Expense Support Reimbursement ). To the extent that no dividends or other distributions are paid to the Company s stockholders in any given month, then the Expense Support Reimbursement for such month shall be equal to such
amount necessary in order for available operating funds for the month to equal zero. The terms of the Expense Support Agreement commenced as of the date that the Company s registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. Most recently,
the Company s board of directors approved an extension of the period during which SIC Advisors may reimburse the Company for operating expenses under the Expense Support Agreement to December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement,
as amended, effective as of April 1, 2016, SIC Advisors may make expense support payments on a discretionary basis by making an election on the last day of each month to fund an expense support payment in an amount equal to the difference
between the Company s distributions paid to the Company s stockholders during such month less the sum of the Company s net investment income, the Company s net realized capital gains and dividends paid to the Company from its
portfolio companies, not included in net income and net realized capital gains during such period.      Pursuant to the Expense
Support Agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation to reimburse SIC Advisors for any amounts funded by SIC Advisors under the Expense Support Agreement if (and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years
of the date on which SIC Advisors incurred a liability for such amount, the sum of the Company s net investment income, the Company s net realized capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company
from its portfolio companies (to the extent not included in net investment income or net realized capital gains) exceeds the distributions paid by the Company to stockholders. The purpose of the Expense Support Agreement is to cover distributions to
stockholders so as to ensure that the distributions do not constitute a return of capital for GAAP purposes and to reduce operating expenses until the Company has raised sufficient capital to be able to absorb such expenses.   
  Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, the Company will reimburse SIC Advisors for expense support payments it previously made
following any calendar quarter for which the Company received net investment   
         9

income, net realized capital gains and dividends from its portfolio companies (not included in net income and net realized capital gains) in excess of the distributions paid to the Company s
stockholders during such calendar quarter (the  Excess Operating Funds ). Any such reimbursement will be made within three years of the date that the expense support payment obligation was incurred by SIC Advisors, subject to the
conditions described below. The amount of the reimbursement during any calendar quarter will equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds received during the quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all expense payments made by SIC
Advisors that have not yet been reimbursed. In addition, the Company will only make reimbursement payments to the extent its current annualized  operating expense ratio  (as described in footnote 1 to the table below) is equal to or less
than its operating expense ratio for the quarter during which the corresponding expense obligation was incurred and to the extent the annualized rate of its regular cash dividends to the Company s stockholders for the month is equal to or
greater than the annualized rate of the Company s regular cash distributions to stockholders for the month during which the corresponding expense payment was incurred.      As of September 30, 2016, we recorded $9,433,037 in our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as due from affiliate relating to the Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 total expense reimbursements from SIC Advisors pursuant to the Expense Support and Reimbursement Agreement were $5,389,627 and $16,093,129, respectively. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, net expenses after taking into account the expense reimbursement from SIC Advisors, were $9,538,699 and $26,880,838. Expense reimbursements to SIC Advisors will be accrued as they become probable and estimatable.   
    Net Realized Gains/Losses from Investments        We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of an investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously
recognized.      During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $10,469,065 and $6,219,699,
respectively, in net realized losses on total investments. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized $3,654,529 and $8,941,649, respectively, in net realized gains on total investments.   
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $11,844,083 in realized losses related to certain non-cash
restructuring transactions, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net realized gain/(loss) from non-controlled/nonaffiliated investments.        Net Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation on Investments        Net change
in unrealized appreciation on investments reflects the net change in the fair value of our total investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had unrealized appreciation of $15,521,547 and $11,665,907, respectively,
on total investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had unrealized depreciation of $31,950,362 and $34,396,646, respectively, on total investments.        Changes in Net Assets from Operations        For the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $20,834,572 and $51,830,080, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net decrease in net assets
resulting from operations of $16,498,728. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $7,068,518. Based on 89,015,100 and 67,105,439 weighted average common shares
outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $0.58 and $0.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

    Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  As a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for
investment purposes. To fund growth, we have a number of alternatives available to increase capital; including raising equity, increasing debt, and funding from operational cash flow.   
  Our liquidity and capital resources have been generated primarily from the net proceeds of our public offering of common stock, use of
our credit facilities and our TRS.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $125.5 million and $93.7
million respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. In the future, we may generate cash from future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S.
government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes, cash distributions to our stockholders, and other general corporate purposes.
     In order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all
of our taxable income, but we may also elect to periodically spillover certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year. In addition, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to
total senior securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow.      The following table shows our net borrowings for the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    On August 12, 2016, we amended our existing senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility (the
 ING Credit Facility ) pursuant to a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the  Revolving Credit Agreement ) with certain lenders party thereto from time to time and ING Capital LLC, as administrative agent. The ING Credit
Facility matures on August 12, 2020 and is secured by substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exclusions as further set forth in an Amended and Restated Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement (the  Security Agreement )
entered into in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, among us, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto, ING Capital LLC, as Administrative Agent, each Financial Agent and Designated Indebtedness Holder party thereto and ING Capital LLC,
as Collateral Agent. The ING Credit Facility also includes usual and customary representations, covenants and events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this nature. On February 13, 2015, commitments to the ING credit
facility were expanded from $150,000,000 to $170,000.000. On August 12, 2016, commitments to the ING credit facility were expanded from $170,000,000 to $175,000,000.      The ING Credit Facility allows for us, at our option, to borrow money at a rate of either (i) an alternate base rate plus 1.50% per annum or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. The interest rate margins are
subject to certain   
         11   

Table of Contents  

step-downs upon the satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The alternate base rate will be the greatest of (i) the U.S. Prime Rate set forth in the Wall
Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1%, and (iii) three month LIBOR plus 1%. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the commitment under the ING Credit Facility was $175,000,000 and $170,000,000, respectively,
and the ING Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for potential future expansion of the ING Credit Facility up to a total of $500,000,000. Availability of loans under the ING Credit Facility is linked to the valuation of the
collateral pursuant to a borrowing base mechanism.      We are also required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders based on the
daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the ING Credit Facility. The commitment fee is (i) 1.50% if the used portion of the aggregate commitments is less than or equal to 40%, (ii) 0.75% if the used portion of the aggregate
commitments is greater than 40% and less than or equal to 65% or (iii) 0.50% if the used portion of the aggregate commitments is greater than 65%. The ING Credit Facility provides that we may use the proceeds of the facility for general corporate
purposes, including making investments in accordance with our investment objective and strategy. As of September 30, 2016, our borrowings under the ING Facility totaled $135,000,000 and were recorded as part of revolving credit facility payable on
our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.      On July 23, 2014, our wholly-owned, special purpose financing
subsidiary, Alpine Funding LLC ( Alpine ), entered into a revolving credit facility (the  Alpine Credit Facility ) pursuant to a Loan Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ( JPMorgan ), as
administrative agent and lender, the Financing Providers from time to time party thereto, SIC Advisors LLC, as the portfolio manager, and the Collateral Administrator, Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary party thereto (the  Loan
Agreement ). Alpine s obligations to JPMorgan under the Alpine Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Alpine, including its portfolio of loans. The obligations of Alpine
under the Alpine Credit Facility are non-recourse to the Company.      Borrowings under the Alpine Credit Facility are subject to
compliance with a net asset value coverage ratio with respect to the current value of Alpine s portfolio and various eligibility criteria must be satisfied with respect to the initial acquisition of each loan in Alpine s portfolio. Any
amounts borrowed under the Alpine Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on July 23, 2019. As of September 30, 2016, Alpine s borrowings under the Alpine Credit Facility
totaled $240,000,000 and were recorded as part of revolving credit facility payable on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.   
   Contractual Obligations    
  The following table shows our payment obligations for repayment of debt, which total our contractual obligations at September 30, 2016:
      
    We have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On April 5,
2012, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with SIC Advisors in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective as of April 17, 2012, the date that we met the minimum offering requirement. Pursuant
to the 1940 Act, the initial term of the Investment Advisory Agreement was for two years from its effective date, with one-year renewals subject to approval by our board of directors, a majority of whom must be independent directors. On
March 2, 2016, the board of directors approved the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement for an additional one-year term at an in-person meeting. SIC Advisors serves as   
         12   

Table of Contents  

our investment advisor in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under our Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period consist of (i) a
management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (ii) an incentive fee based on our performance.   
  On April 5, 2012, we entered into the Administration Agreement with Medley Capital LLC with an initial term of two years, pursuant
to which Medley Capital LLC furnishes us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. On March 2, 2016, the board of directors approved the renewal of the Administration Agreement for an additional one-year term
at an in-person meeting. Medley Capital LLC is reimbursed for administrative expenses it incurs on our behalf in performing its obligations. Such costs are reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable
methods. We do not reimburse Medley Capital LLC for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of Medley Capital LLC.
     If any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we
enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the investment advisory agreement and administration agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement
would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  On August 27, 2013, Arbor Funding LLC ( Arbor ), a wholly-owned financing subsidiary of the Company, entered into a total
return swap ( TRS ) with Citibank, N.A. ( Citibank ).      On March 21, 2016, Arbor entered into the
Fourth Amended and Restated Confirmation Letter Agreement (the  Fourth Amended Confirmation Agreement ) with Citibank. The Fourth Amended Confirmation Agreement extended the term of the TRS from March 21, 2016 through March 21,
2019 and increased the interest rate payable to Citi from LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum to LIBOR plus 1.65% per annum. Other than the foregoing, the Fourth Amended Confirmation Agreement did not change any of the other terms of the TRS.
     The TRS with Citibank enables Arbor to obtain the economic benefit of the loans underlying the TRS, despite the fact that
such loans will not be directly held or otherwise owned by Arbor, in return for an interest-type payment to Citibank. Accordingly, the TRS is analogous to Arbor utilizing leverage to acquire loans and incurring an interest expense to a lender.
     SIC Advisors acts as the investment manager of Arbor and has discretion over the composition of the basket of loans
underlying the TRS. The terms of the TRS are governed by an ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, the Schedule thereto and Credit Support Annex to such Schedule, and the Confirmation exchanged thereunder, between Arbor and Citibank, which collectively
establish the TRS, and are collectively referred to herein as the  TRS Agreement .      Our derivative asset from
Citibank, net of amounts available for offset under a master netting agreement as of September 30, 2016 was $0, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as receivable due on total return swap.   
  Transactions in total return swap contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $761 thousand in realized gains
and $5.2 million in unrealized gains, which is recorded on the consolidated statements of operations.      For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the average notional par amount of total return swap contracts was $208.3 million.      On
March 27, 2015, Sierra Income Corporation and Great American Life Insurance Company ( GALIC ) entered into a limited liability company operating agreement to co-manage Sierra Senior Loan Strategy JV I LLC
  
         13   

Table of Contents  

( Sierra JV ). Sierra Income Corporation and GALIC have committed to provide $100 million of equity to Sierra JV, with Sierra Income Corporation providing $87.5 million and GALIC
providing $12.5 million. Sierra JV commenced operations on July 15, 2015. On August 4, 2015, Sierra JV entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the  JV Facility ) led by Credit Suisse, AG with initial commitments
of $100 million. On December 29, 2015, the Credit Facility was amended and the commitment increased to $135,000,000. As of September 30, 2016, there was $120.7 million outstanding under the JV Facility and the Sierra JV had total assets at
fair value of $159.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, Sierra JV s portfolio was comprised of 99.1% of Senior Secured First Lien Term Loans and 0.9% Preferred Equity to 35 different borrowers with one loan on non-accrual status.
     Sierra Income Corporation has determined that Sierra JV is an investment company under ASC 946, however in accordance with
such guidance, Sierra Income Corporation will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than a wholly owned investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the
Company. Accordingly, Sierra Income Corporation does not consolidate its interest in Sierra JV.       Distributions    
  We have elected and intend to continue to qualify to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a RIC under subchapter M of the
Code. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among others things, distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to
avoid certain U.S. federal excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (i) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess
of capital losses for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year) and (iii) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not
distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.      While we intend to distribute any income and
capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that event, we will be
liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.      We currently intend to
distribute net capital gains ( i.e.,  net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions. However, we may decide in the future to retain
such capital gains for investment and elect to treat such gains as deemed distributions to you. If this happens, you will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if you had received an actual distribution of the capital gains that we
retain and reinvested the net after tax proceeds in us. In this situation, you would be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to your allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed
distributed to you. We can offer no assurance that we will continue to achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, if we issue senior securities, we may be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to
fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.      Subject to our board of directors  discretion and applicable legal restrictions, we expect to authorize and pay monthly distributions to our stockholders. Any distributions to our stockholders will
be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We expect to continue making monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions, or other factors prohibit us from doing
so. From time to time, but not less than quarterly, we will review our accounts to determine whether distributions to our stockholders are appropriate. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from available sources to make
distributions. We expect that for a significant time after the commencement of our offering, a portion of our distributions may result from expense support payments made by SIC Advisors that   
         14   

Table of Contents  

may be subject to repayment by us within three years. The purpose of this arrangement is to cover distributions to stockholders so as to ensure that the distributions do not constitute a return
of capital for GAAP purposes. We may still have distributions which could be characterized as a return of capital. Such distributions are not based on our investment performance and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance
in future periods and/or SIC Advisors continues to make Expense Support Payments under the Expense Support Agreement. Any future reimbursements to SIC Advisors will reduce the distributions that may otherwise be available for distribution to
stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to sustain our distributions or that we will be able to pay distributions at all. SIC Advisors has no obligation to make Expense Support Payments pursuant to the
Expense Support Agreement after December 31, 2016, unless the Expense Support Agreement is extended. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, if net Expense Support Payments of $5,389,627 and $16,093,129, respectively, were
not made by SIC Advisors, approximately 30% and 30% of the distributions would have been a return of capital for GAAP purposes, respectively.      Our distributions may exceed our earnings, which we refer to as a return of capital, especially during the period before we have invested substantially all of the proceeds of our offering. As a result, a
portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. Our use of the term  return of capital  merely means distributions in excess of our earnings and as such may constitute a return on your individual investments and
does not mean a return on capital. Therefore stockholders are advised that they should be aware of the differences with our use of the term  return of capital  and  return on capital.    
  The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that the Company has declared or paid to its stockholders for the current
and prior fiscal years. Stockholders of record as of each respective record date were entitled to receive the distribution.       
 
         15   

Table of Contents  

   We have adopted an  opt in  distribution reinvestment plan pursuant to which our
common stockholders may elect to have the full amount of any cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. As a result, if we declare a cash distribution, stockholders that have  opted in  to our distribution
reinvestment plan will have their distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to
the same federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.      Each year a statement on Internal
Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV (or such successor form) identifying the source of the distribution ( i.e.,  paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gain on the sale of securities, or a return of capital) will be mailed to our
stockholders. The tax basis of shares must be reduced by the amount of any return of capital distributions, which will result in an increase in the amount of any taxable gain (or a reduction in any deductible loss) on the sale of shares.   
   Related Party Transactions       On October 19, 2011, SIC Advisors entered into a subscription agreement to purchase 110.80 shares of common stock for cash consideration of $1,000. The consideration represents $9.025 per share.
     On April 17, 2012, SIC Advisors purchased 1,108,033.24 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of
$10,000,000. The consideration represents $9.025 per share.      We have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement and Expense
Support and Reimbursement Agreement with SIC Advisors in which our senior management holds an equity interest. Members of our senior management also serve as principals of other investment managers affiliated with SIC Advisors that do, and may in
the future, manage investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles with investment objectives similar to ours.      We
have entered into an Administration Agreement with Medley Capital LLC, pursuant to which Medley Capital LLC furnishes us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. Medley Capital LLC is reimbursed for administrative
expenses it incurs on our behalf. We do not reimburse Medley Capital LLC for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of
Medley Capital LLC. Medley Capital LLC is an affiliate of SIC Advisors.      We have entered into a dealer manager agreement with
SC Distributors, LLC who receives a dealer manager fee of up to 2.75% of gross proceeds raised in the offering. An affiliated entity of SC Distributors, LLC owns an equity interest in SIC Advisors, which provides the right to receive a fixed
percentage of the management fees received by SIC Advisors.      We have entered into a license agreement with SIC Advisors under
which SIC Advisors has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  Sierra  for specified purposes in our business. Under this agreement, we will have a right to use the  Sierra  name, subject to
certain conditions, for so long as SIC Advisors or one of its affiliates remains our investment advisor. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the  Sierra  name.   
   Management Fee       We pay
SIC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The fee consists of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee.      The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets and is payable quarterly in arrears. The incentive fee consists of:   

An incentive fee on net investment income ( subordinated incentive fee on income ) is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and is
based upon pre-incentive fee net investment income for the      
         16   

Table of Contents  

immediately preceding quarter. No subordinated incentive fee on income is payable in any calendar quarter in which pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed a quarterly return to
stockholders of 1.75% per quarter on the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, or the preferred quarterly return. All pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the quarterly
preferred return, but is less than or equal to 2.1875% of net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter in any quarter, will be payable to SIC Advisors. The Company refers to this portion of its subordinated incentive fee on
income as the catch up. It is intended to provide an incentive fee of 20% on pre-incentive fee net investment income when pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.1875% of net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter in any
quarter. For any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.1875% of net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, the subordinated incentive fee on income shall equal 20% of the amount of
pre-incentive fee net investment income, because the preferred return and catch up will have been achieved.          

A capital gains incentive fee will be earned on realized investments and shall be payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year during which
the IAA is in effect. If the IAA is terminated, the fee will become payable as of the effective date of such termination. The capital gains incentive fee is based on our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, computed net of
all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, which we refer to as  net realized capital gains.  The capital gains incentive fee equals  20% of net realized capital gains, less the aggregate
amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee.         Under the terms of the investment advisory
agreement, SIC Advisors bears all organization and offering expenses on our behalf. Since June 2, 2014, the date that we raised $300 million in gross proceeds in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, SIC Advisors has no longer
been obligated to bear, pay or otherwise be responsible for any ongoing organization and offering expenses on our behalf, and we have been responsible for paying or otherwise incurring all such organization and offering expenses. Pursuant to the
terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse SIC Advisors for any such organizational and offering expenses incurred by SIC Advisors not to exceed 1.25% of the gross subscriptions raised by us over the course of the
offering period, which was initially scheduled to terminate two years from the initial offering date, unless extended. Most recently, at a meeting held on March 2, 2016, our board of directors approved another extension of our offering for an
additional year, which will extend the offering through April 17, 2017, unless further extended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that organizational and offering expenses, together with sales commissions, the dealer manager fee and
any discounts paid to members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, exceed 15% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to our registration statement or otherwise at the time of the completion of our
offering, then SIC Advisors shall be required to pay or, if already paid by us, reimburse us for amounts exceeding such 15% limit.   
   Critical Accounting Policies       This discussion of our expected operating plans is based upon our expected consolidated financial statements, which will be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements will require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic
environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we will describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our future
consolidated financial statements.       Valuation of Investments       The Company applies fair value accounting to all of its financial instruments in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ). ASC
820 defines fair value,

establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments carried
at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as identified below and discussed in Note 4.       

Level 1   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. Publicly listed equities and publicly
listed derivatives will be included in Level 1. In addition, securities sold, but not yet purchased and call options will be included in Level 1. We will not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large
position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price.          

Level 2   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by
reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions
in comparable investments, and various relationships between investments. Investments which are generally expected to be included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, convertible debt indexed to publicly listed securities, and certain
over-the-counter derivatives.          

Level 3   Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the
investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation. Investments that are expected to be included in this category are our private portfolio companies.      
  Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather
than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at
the measurement date.      Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations,
which are generally obtained from an independent pricing service or multiple broker-dealers or market makers. We weight the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual
transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer. However, debt investments with remaining maturities within 60 days that are not credit impaired are valued at cost plus accreted
discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value. Investments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by the Company s board of directors based upon input from management
and third party valuation firms. Because these investments are illiquid and because there may not be any directly comparable companies whose financial instruments have observable market values, these loans are valued using a fundamental valuation
methodology, consistent with traditional asset pricing standards, that is objective and consistently applied across all loans and through time.      The Company uses third-party valuation firms to assist the board of directors in the valuation of its portfolio investments. The valuation reports generated by the third-party valuation firms consider the
evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market based information, including comparable transactions, performance multiples, and movement in yields of debt instruments, among other factors. Based on
market data obtained from the third-party valuation firms, the Company uses a combined market yield analysis and an enterprise model of valuation. In applying the market yield analysis, the value of the Company s loans is determined based upon
inputs such as the coupon rate, current market yield, interest rate spreads of similar securities, the stated value of the loan, and the length to maturity. In applying the enterprise model, the Company uses a waterfall analysis which takes into
account the specific capital structure of the   
         18   

Table of Contents  

borrower and the related seniority of the instruments within the borrower s capital structure into consideration. To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, we weigh some or
all of the traditional market valuation methods and factors based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value. The methodologies for performing investments may be based on, among other things:
valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations of the portfolio company, considering offers from third
parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company. For non-performing investments, we may estimate the liquidation or
collateral value of the portfolio company s assets and liabilities using an expected recovery model. We may estimate the fair value of warrants based on a model such as the Black-Scholes model or simulation models or a combination thereof.
     The Company undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are
not readily available, as described below:       

the Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio investment being initially valued by the valuation professionals;

conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management; and      

an independent valuation firm engaged by the Company s board of directors prepares an independent valuation report for approximately one third of
the portfolio investments each quarter on a rotating quarterly basis on non fiscal year-end quarters, such that each of these investments will be valued by an independent valuation firm at least twice per annum when combined with the fiscal year-end
review of all the investments by independent valuation firms, exclusive of the TRS underlying portfolio.         In
addition, all of the Company s investments are subject to the following valuation process:       

management reviews preliminary valuations and their own independent assessment;      

the audit committee of the Company s board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of senior management and independent valuation firms;
and          

the Company s board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio in good
faith based on the input of SIC Advisors, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.      
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair
value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.   
  The valuation procedures described are generally applied to the loans underlying the TRS, except that such assets are not reviewed by
independent third party valuation firms. We will value the TRS in accordance with the TRS Agreement. Pursuant to the TRS Agreement, the value of the TRS will be based on the increase or decrease in the value of the assets underlying the TRS,
together with accrued interest income, interest expense and certain other expenses incurred under the TRS. The assets underlying the TRS will be valued by Citibank. Citibank will base its valuation on the indicative bid prices provided by an
independent third-party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that market participants may be willing to pay. These valuations will be sent to us for review and testing. Our board of directors will review and approve the value of the
TRS, as well as the value of the assets underlying the TRS, on a quarterly basis as part of their quarterly determination of net asset value. To the extent our board of directors has any questions or concerns regarding the valuation of the assets
underlying the TRS, such valuation will be discussed or challenged pursuant to the terms of the TRS. For additional disclosures on the TRS, see    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

   The Company s investments in subordinated notes are carried at fair value, which is
based on a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model models both the underlying collateral ( assets ) and the liabilities of the collateralized loan obligation ( CLO ) capital structure. The discounted cash flow
model uses a set of assumptions including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rates and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated cash flows of the assets. The discounted cash flow model distributes the asset cash flows to
the liability structure based on the payment priorities and discounts them back using appropriate market discount rates based on discount rates for comparable CLOs. The assumptions are based on available market data as well as management estimates.
Additional data is used to validate the results from the discounted cash flow method, such as analysis of relevant data observed in the CLO market, review of quotes, where available, recent acquisitions and observable transactions in the
subordinated notes, among other factors.        Revenue Recognition     
  We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with
contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance, we generally will not accrue PIK interest for accounting purposes if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not
collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities or accounting purposes if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Original issue discounts, market discounts or premiums are accreted or
amortized using the effective interest method as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as fee income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such
amount.        Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation     
  We measure net realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis
of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in
portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.        Payment-in-Kind Interest        We have investments in our portfolio that
contain a PIK interest provision. Any PIK interest is added to the principal balance of such investments and is recorded as income, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is collectible. In order to maintain our status
as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends, even if we have not collected any cash.   
    Organization and Offering Expenses        As of June 2, 2014, the Company is responsible for all ongoing organization and offering expenses.        U.S. Federal Income Taxes        We have elected to be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to
our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To obtain and maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90% of our
ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.

    Recent Developments       On October 4, 2016, our board of directors approved the Tenth Amendment to the Expense Support Agreement between us and SIC Advisors (the    Tenth Amendment   ). Pursuant to the Tenth
Amendment, the period during which SIC Advisors may reimburse us for operating expenses under the Expense Support Agreement has been extended to December 31, 2016 from September 30, 2016.   
  On October 4, 2016, our board of directors declared a series of semi-monthly distributions for October, November and December 2016 in the
amount of $0.02667 per share. Below are the details for each respective distribution:       
       Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
  We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Under the terms of the TRS between Arbor and Citibank,
Arbor will pay fees to Citibank at a floating rate based on LIBOR in exchange for the right to receive the economic benefit of a portfolio of assets having a maximum notional amount of $300,000,000. Our interest expense will also be affected by
changes in the published LIBOR rate in connection with our Credit Facilities. We expect any future credit facilities, total return swap agreements or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries may enter into will also be based
on a floating interest rate. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates, when we or our subsidiaries have debt outstanding or swap agreements in effect, our cost of funds
would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments.      In
addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency
markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved.   
  Based on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016, the following table shows the approximate
increase/(decrease) in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investment and capital structure:

    Disclosure Controls     
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), we,
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.        Change In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting        No change
occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.         Part II   Other Information

Item 2:   
   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.         In June 2013, we commenced a share repurchase program pursuant to which it intends to conduct quarterly share repurchases, of up to 2.5% of the weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 3-month
period or 10% of the weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 12-month period. The purpose of the share repurchase program is to allow stockholders to sell their shares back to us at a price equal to the most recently disclosed net asset
value per share of our common stock immediately prior to the date of repurchase. Shares will be purchased from stockholders participating in the program on a pro rata basis. Unless our board of directors determines otherwise, the number of shares to
be repurchased during any calendar year will be limited to the proceeds received in association with the sale of shares of common stock under the distribution reinvestment plan. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more
information.
