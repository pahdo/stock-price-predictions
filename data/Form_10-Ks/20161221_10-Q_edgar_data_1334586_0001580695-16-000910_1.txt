Note
1. Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Jammin Java Corp. (the   Company  ) have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (  SEC  ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes
thereto contained in the Company s latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results
of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period. Notes to the financial
statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year as reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K have been omitted. The accompanying balance sheet at
January 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited balance sheet contained in such Form 10-K.  

As
used in this Quarterly Report, the terms   we,     us,     our,     Jammin
Java   and the   Company   mean Jammin Java Corp., unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts in
this Quarterly Report are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.  

Note
2. Going Concern and Liquidity   

These
financial statements have been prepared by management assuming that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern and
contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classifications of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company incurred a net loss of $4,381,788 for the six months ended July 31, 2016, and has an accumulated deficit since inception
of $33,627,538. The Company has a history of losses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The operations of the Company have primarily been funded by the issuance of debt instruments as
well as the sale of its common stock. The Company will, in the future, need to secure additional funds through future equity sales
or other fund raising activities. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will
be on terms acceptable to the Company.  

The
Company s ability to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon its ability to sell its products
directly to end-users and through distributors, establish profitable operations through increased sales and decreased expenses,
and obtain additional funds when needed. Management intends to increase sales by increasing the Company s product offerings,
expanding its direct sales force and expanding its domestic and international distributor relationships.  

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase sales, reduce expenses or obtain additional financing, if necessary,
at a level to meet its current obligations. As a result, the opinion the Company received from its independent registered public
accounting firm on its January 31, 2016 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is a substantial
doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Note
3. Business Overview and Summary of Accounting Policies   

Jammin
Java, doing business as Marley Coffee, is a United States ( U.S. )-based company that provides sustainably grown,
ethically farmed and artisan roasted gourmet coffee through multiple U.S. and international distribution channels, using the Marley
Coffee brand name. U.S. and international grocery retail channels have become the Company s largest revenue channels, followed
by online retail, office coffee services (referred to herein as OCS), food service outlets and licensing. The Company intends
to continue to develop these revenue channels and achieve a leadership position in the gourmet coffee space by capitalizing on
the global recognition of the Marley name through the licensing of the Marley Coffee trademarks.  

Reclassifications.  Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation for comparative purposes.  

Use
of Estimates in Financial Statement Preparation.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (  GAAP  ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial statement disclosures.
While management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate,
actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.  

Revenue
Recognition.  Revenue is derived from the sale of coffee products and is recognized on a gross basis upon shipment to the customer.
All revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the service or sale is completed; (iii)
the price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the ability to collect is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount
estimated to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade allowances and product terms. We record promotional
and return allowances based on recent and historical trends. Promotional allowances, including customer incentive and trade promotion
activities, are recorded as a reduction to sales based on amounts estimated being due to customers, based primarily on historical
utilization and redemption rates. Discounts and promotional allowances deducted from sales for the six months ended July 31, 2016
and 2015 were $556,636 and $479,758, respectively.  

The
Company utilizes third parties for the production and fulfillment of orders placed by customers. The Company, acting as principal,
takes title to the product and assumes the risks of ownership; namely, the risks of loss for collection, delivery and returns.  

Accounts
due to/due from Roasters.  We source coffee that we sell to our roaster, Mother Parkers Tea   Coffee Inc. (  Mother
Parkers  ), a related party and shareholder of the Company, who in turn sells it to its own customers. This is especially
the case with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee secured by us. At July 31, 2016, we are owed $584,455 by Mother Parkers. We also utilize
the services of Mother Parkers, to roast coffee to our specifications for sale to the Company s customers. As a result,
at July 31, 2016, we owed $2,174,916 to Mother Parkers for roasting services. The liabilities are presented as a net liability
of $1,590,461 in accounts payable on the balance sheet.  

Financial
assets and liabilities are subject to offset and presented as net amounts in the statement of financial position when, and only
when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to offset amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or
to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Company does not have offset rights with respect to Mother Parkers
due to/due from amounts at July 31, 2016.  

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts.  The Company does not require collateral from its customers with respect to accounts receivable. The
Company determines any required allowance by considering a number of factors, including the terms for each customer, and the length
of time accounts receivable are outstanding. Management provides an allowance for accounts receivable whenever it is evident that
they become uncollectible. The Company has reserved an allowance of $78,760 and $78,760, respectively for doubtful accounts at
July 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016. Because our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers,
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect
on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results.  

Inventories.  Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using weighted average cost, which approximates actual cost, on a
first-in, first-out basis. Inventories on hand are evaluated on an on-going basis to determine if any items are obsolete or in
excess of future needs. Items determined to be obsolete are reserved for. The Company provides for the possible inability to sell
its inventories b y providing an excess inventory reserve. As of July 31, 2016 and January
31, 2016, inventory was not significant.    

Property
and Equipment.  Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs, as
incurred, are charged to expense. Renewals and enhancements which extend the life or improve existing equipment are capitalized.
Upon disposition or retirement of equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain
or loss is reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are three years.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets.  Long-lived assets consist primarily of a license agreement that was recorded at the estimated cost
to acquire the asset. The license agreement is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable (see Note 4). Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate
of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash
flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated
fair values. Management evaluated the carrying value of long-lived assets including the license and determined that no impairment
existed at July 31, 2016.  

Stock-Based
Compensation .  Pursuant to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) Accounting
Standards Codification (  ASC  ) 718-10,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   ,  which
establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service, management utilizes the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock option awards at the date of grant, which requires the input
of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can
materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally
require significant analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions will be based on, or
determined from, external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock-based payment arrangements.
The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances.  

Common
stock issued for services to non-employees is recorded based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever
is more clearly determinable. Whenever the value of the services is not determinable, the measurement date occurs generally at
the date of issuance of the stock. In more limited cases, it occurs when a commitment for performance has been reached with the
counterparty and nonperformance is subject to significant disincentives. If the total value of stock issued exceeds the par value,
the value in excess of the par value is added to the additional paid-in-capital. We estimate volatility of our publicly-listed
common stock by considering historical stock volatility.  

Income
Taxes.  The Company follows  FASB  ASC 740,  Income Taxes . The Company records deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and on net operating
loss carry forwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation
allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

Earnings
or Loss Per Common Share.  Basic earnings or loss per common share equals net earnings or loss divided by the
weighted average of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings or loss per share includes the impact on
dilution from all contingently issuable shares, including options, warrants and convertible securities. The common stock
equivalents from contingent shares are determined by the treasury stock method. The Company incurred a net loss for the three
months and six months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, contingently issuable shares were excluded
from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive for all periods presented. In
addition, basic and diluted earnings or loss per share for such periods are the same because all potential common equivalent
shares total 21,580,195 shares were excluded from the calculation.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements . Accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies
that do not require adoption until a future date are being evaluated by the Company to determine whether adoption will have a
material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

Note
4 .  Trademark License Agreements and Intangible Assets   

On
June 27, 2016, and effective June 24, 2016, Fifty-Six Hope Road Music Limited (  56 Hope Road  ) provided
the Company with a notice of the termination of the fifteen year license agreement entered into with 56 Hope Road on
September 13, 2012 (the   License Agreement  ). 56 Hope Road terminated the License Agreement due to the
Company s alleged breach of certain of its terms, including, but not limited to, the Company s failure to deliver
quarterly statements in a timely manner, the Company s failure to timely make licensing payments, the Company s
failure to deliver audited financial statements in a timely manner, and the SEC s complaint against the Company. Some
of these breaches were due to cash flow issues and corporate governance matters.  

Rohan
Marley, our former Chairman, owns an interest in 56 Hope Road.  

On
July 6, 2016, the Company and Hope Road Merchandising, LLC (  HRM  ), which exclusively controls
all licensing of 56 Hope Road s intellectual property rights, entered into a Short Term License Agreement
(the   Short-Term License  ) in exchange for a Secured Promissory Note for $297,324. The Secured Promissory
Note bears interest at 0.71% per year and is payable along with accrued interest at maturity on August 31, 2016. This note is
currently in default and a party to the litigation described below. The Short-Term License provides the Company the right to
use the  Marley Coffee  trademarks (the  Trademarks ) from June 27, 2016 until December 27, 2016 (a
term of six months). This note is currently in default and the subject of the litigation described below.   

The
Company planned to continue to work with HRM and 56 Hope Road in good faith to try to extend the terms of the Short-Term License
and remain partners, as well as to preserve shareholder value. Notwithstanding that, on July 21, 2016, HRM and 56 Hope Road provided
the Company notice of the termination of the Short-Term License and demanded that all use of the Trademarks cease immediately.
56 Hope Road terminated the Short-Term License due to the Company s alleged breach of certain of the terms of the Short-Term
License, including, but not limited to, the Company s failure to deliver quarterly statements and annual audited financial
statements in a timely manner, and issues raised regarding security interests alleged to have been granted by the Company in connection
with the licenses, to various third parties in alleged violation of the licenses. The Company believes that the termination notice
received on July 21, 2016 as well as the termination of the License Agreement, was without merit and that 56 Hope Road has no
reasonable basis for such terminations.    

On
August 1, 2016, 56 Hope Road and HRM filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, County
of Los Angeles, Central Division (Case No. BC628981). The complaint (a) seeks a declaratory judgment relating to the termination
of the licenses, (b) seeks damages for our alleged (i) breaches of the License Agreement and Short-Term License, (ii) tortious
interference with 56 Hope Road s and HRM s economic relationships with licenses and prospective licensees, and (iii)
trademark infringement; (c) requests an accounting of our books and records; and (d) requests punitive and exemplary damages in
connection with allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. The Company vehemently denies the allegations made by 56 Hope Road
and HRM, and plans to vigorously defend themselves against the claims made in the complaint.  

On
August 4, 2016, the Company filed (a) a notice of removal with the court, requesting the case be removed from state court to the
United States District Court for the Central District of California; (b) a request for a temporary restraining order requesting
the court to reinstate the Short-Term License until a final decision on the pending lawsuit is determined; and (c) an answer to
the complaint denying the allegations of 56 Hope Road and HRM, including certain affirmative defenses, and pleading counterclaims
against (i) 56 Hope Road for breach of contract and breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, (ii) 56 Hope Road
and HRM for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage and intentional and negligent misrepresentation,
and (iii) breach of fiduciary duty against Rohan Marley, and seeking that the court enter judgment in favor of the Company on
all claims alleged by 56 Hope Road and HRM and further seeking economic damages, punitive and exemplary damages, pre-and-post
judgment interest and court costs from 56 Hope Road, HRM and Rohan Marley.  

The
case was then removed to the United States District Court of California Western Division (Case No. 2:16-cv-05810-SVW-MRW).
56 Hope Road and HRM subsequently amended their complaint to seek damages for alleged breach of contract in connection with
the License Agreement and Short-Term License, declaratory relief in connection with the License Agreement and Short-Term
License (i.e., that such agreements have been effectively terminated by us), interference with prospective economic
advantage, trademark infringement, accountings, fraud, and indemnity. The Company denied the allegations, asserted certain
several affirmative defenses and filed counterclaims against Rohan Marley for breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy,
which claims 56 Hope Road, HRM and Rohan Marley have moved to be dismissed. Trial is currently set for March 2017. The
Company believes that pending the outcome of the litigation, it is legally able to utilize the trademark through the term of
the Short-Term License.  

In
the event that the Company is unable, through the pending litigation or otherwise, to obtain rights to the Trademarks, it will
have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to generate revenue, the Company s results of operations and
assets, could force the Company to abandon or attempt to change its business operations, which are currently solely focused on
monetizing the Trademarks, and may force the Company to seek bankruptcy protection, all of which could cause the value of the
Company s common stock to decline in value or become worthless. Furthermore, the Company believes that its ability to generate
revenue will be significantly limited during the period the lawsuit described above is pending.  

Intangible
assets primarily relate to our License Agreement with 56 Hope Road. The License Agreement had been amortized using a life of fifteen
years since its inception. The Company believes that the license with 56 Hope Road is still currently valid and continues to operate
as such. Management, in consultation with its legal team, do not believe the license is impaired until such time that the license
has been evacuated from a legal perspective.  

License agreement, net consists of the following:  

The
amortization period is six months. Amortization expense consists of the following:

Revolving
Line of Credit   Colorado Medical Finance Services, LLC    

Effective
on February 16, 2015, the Company entered into an unsecured Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with Colorado Medical Finance Services,
LLC, dba Gold Gross Capital LLC. The line of credit allows the Company the right to borrow up to $500,000 from the lender from
time to time. Amounts borrowed under the line of credit accrue interest at the rate of 17.5% per annum and can be repaid at any
time without penalty. A total of 10% of the interest rate is payable in cash and the other 7.5% of the interest rate is payable
in cash, or as a reduction of accounts receivable related to coffee sales/services, at the option of the lender, with our consent.
We have paid, and intend to continue to pay all related interest in cash. The line of credit expired, and all amounts were due
under the line of credit on September 26, 2016. The Company has informally been granted a reduction of payments to them in the
amount of $3,000 per month until the end of the trial in which case it will be re-evaluated where the note stands.  Upon
the occurrence of an event of default the amounts owed under the line of credit bear interest at the rate of 20% per annum. Proceeds
from the line of credit can be solely used for working capital purposes. The lender has no relationship with the Company or its
affiliates. As of July 31, 2016 there was $76,513 outstanding which included $56,318 in principal and $20,195 in interest due.
The payments due on this line of credit have been made on a monthly basis.

Convertible
Promissory Notes Payable - with Typenex Co-Investment, LLC    

On
September 14, 2015 (the   Closing Date  ), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the   Typenex
SPA  ) with Typenex Co-Investment, LLC (  Typenex  ). Pursuant to the Typenex SPA, the Company issued
to Typenex convertible promissory notes with a total principal amount of $1,005,000 in the form of: (a) an initial tranche of
$255,000 in cash (the   Typenex Note  ), and (b) three promissory notes of $250,000 each. The Typenex Note has
a term of 20 months and an interest rate of 10% per annum (22% upon an event of default). The gross proceeds to the Company from
the Typenex SPA were $1,005,000, in the form of: (a) an initial tranche of $250,000 in cash, and (b) three promissory notes of
$250,000 each (collectively, the   Investor Notes  ). Typenex and the Company must mutually agree to fund one
or more of the three additional Investor Notes. As of July 31, 2016, none of the additional three tranches were funded and only
$255,000 had been funded. Each of the Investor Notes accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum until paid and are secured
by a Membership Interest Pledge Agreement. Beginning in March 2016, and on the same day of each month thereafter until the maturity
date, the Company is required to pay to Typenex monthly installments of principal equal to $75,000 (or such lesser principal amount
as is then outstanding), plus the sum of any accrued and unpaid interest. Alternatively, Typenex or the Company may elect to convert
an installment amount into Common Stock at the lower of (a) $0.30 per share, and (b) if the Company s market capitalization
falls below $3,000,000, the Market Price conversion price shall be adjusted to the market price as of the applicable date, applying
a discount of 40%. The Company has the right to prepay the Typenex Note under certain circumstances, subject to payment of a 35%
prepayment penalty during the first six months the note is outstanding and 50% thereafter. The Typenex Note also includes repricing
features whereby if the Company sells or issues any common stock or other securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common
Stock for a price per share that is less than the conversion price applicable under the Typenex Note, then such lower price will
apply to all subsequent conversions by Typenex. The repricing feature of the conversion feature was considered to be derivative
liabilities and accordingly, the Company recorded approximately a $178,000 discount to debt. During the quarter ended July 31,
2016, the outstanding balance was repaid in full. Upon repayment, the derivative liability of approximately $58,000 was reclassified
to additional paid-in capital.

funding. Each advance under the JMJ Convertible Note is due two years from the date of such advance, with the amount initially
funded under the note due on September 16, 2017. The JMJ Convertible Note (including principal and accrued interest and where
applicable other fees) is convertible into our common stock, at any time, at the lesser of (a) $0.75 per share or (b) 65% (a 35%
discount) of the market price for our common stock. The variable conversion term was considered to be a derivative liability and
the Company recorded approximately $303,000 of debt discount upon issuance. The derivative liability had a fair value of approximately
$480,000 as of July 31, 2016. A one-time interest charge of 12% was applied to the principal amount of the note, which remains
payable regardless of the repayment (or conversion) date of the note. At July 31, 2016, the amount owed JMJ Financial was $450,726

discount upon issuance. The prepayment amount ranges from 108% to 133% of the then outstanding balance, depending on when
such prepayment is made. In March 2016, we paid $347,172 to satisfy the amount outstanding under the Vis Vires Convertible

$231,527 of which $225,000 was principal and $16,527 was interest payable. The New Vis Vires Convertible Note conversion
price also includes price protection such that in the event we issue or are deemed to have issued common stock or convertible
securities at a price equal to less than the conversion price of the New Vis Vires Convertible Note, the conversion price of
the New Vis Vires Convertible Note is automatically reduced to such lower price. The repricing feature of the conversion
feature was considered to be derivative liabilities and accordingly, the Company recorded approximately $152,000 of discount
to debt. The Company revalued the derivative liability at approximately $166,000 as of July 31, 2016.

8. Commitments and Contingencies   

From
time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course
of our business.  

On
September 30, 2014, Shane Whittle, individually, a former significant shareholder and officer and director of the Company (  Whittle  ),
and derivatively on behalf of Marley Coffee LLC (  MCL  ) filed a complaint against Rohan Marley, Cedella Marley,
the Company,  HRM ,  56 Hope Road , and Marley Coffee Estate Limited (  Marley Coffee Estate  ) in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (Civil Action No. 2014-CV-2680).  

The
complaint alleged that Whittle entered into a partnership with Rohan Marley, the son of the late reggae music legend Robert Nesta
Marley p/k/a Bob Marley, to sell premium coffee products branded after the name and likeness of Rohan Marley. The causes of action
set forth in the complaint included, among others, racketeering activity, trademark infringement, breach of fiduciary duty, civil
theft, and civil conspiracy (some of which causes of action were not directly alleged against the Company), which were alleged
to have directly caused Whittle and MCL substantial financial harm. Damages claimed by Whittle and MCL included economic damages
to be proven at trial, profits made by defendants, treble damages, punitive damages, attorneys  fees and pre and post judgment
interest.  

Effective
on May 19, 2016, Whittle, MCL, Rohan Marley, Cedella Marley, the Company, HRM and 56 Hope Road entered into a Settlement Agreement
in connection with the proceeding described above (at the same time Whittle entered into a separate settlement agreement with
Marley Coffee Estate). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, (a) Whittle agreed to resign as a manager of MCL, assign his approximate
29% membership interest in MCL to MCL for $1.00 of total consideration, and also consented to the redemption of certain other
outstanding membership interests in such entity; (b) Whittle agreed to cancel and terminate the options to purchase 2 million
shares of the Company s common stock which he held as of the date of the parties  entry into the Settlement Agreement
for $1.00 of total consideration; (c) Whittle agreed to release and waive any rights to any past due or future due payments owed
by the Company under the Settlement described above, including releasing the remaining amount of $10,000 which Whittle was due
pursuant to such Settlement; (d) Whittle provided a general release to each of the defendants (including the Company and Rohan
Marley) from all claims, liability and obligations which Whittle had against such defendants; and (e) each of the defendants (including
the Company and Rohan Marley) provided Whittle a general release from all claims, liability and obligations which such defendants
had against Whittle.  

In
connection with the entry into the Settlement Agreement and the settlement of the lawsuit, the lawsuit described above was dismissed.  

On
November 17, 2015, the SEC filed a complaint against us (Case 2:15-cv-08921) in the United States District Court Central District
of California Western Division. Also included as defendants in the complaint were Shane G. Whittle (our former Chief Executive
Officer and Director) and parties unrelated to us, Wayne S. P. Weaver, Michael K. Sun, Rene Berlinger, Stephen B. Wheatley, Kevin
P. Miller, Mohammed A. Al-Barwani, Alexander J. Hunter, and Thomas E. Hunter (collectively, the   Defendants  ).
Pursuant to the complaint, the SEC alleged that Mr. Whittle orchestrated a   pump and dump   scheme with certain
other of the Defendants in connection with our common stock. The scheme allegedly involved utilizing our July 2009 reverse merger
transaction to secretly gain control of millions of our shares, spreading the stock to offshore entities, and dumping the shares
on the unsuspecting public after the stock price soared following fraudulent promotional campaigns undertaken by Mr. Whittle and
certain other of the Defendants in or around 2011. The complaint also alleges that to boost our stock price and provide cash to
the Company, Mr. Whittle and certain other of the Defendants orchestrated a sham financing arrangement designed to create the
false appearance of legitimate third-party interest and investment in the Company through a non-existent entity, Straight Path
Capital, pursuant to which we raised approximately $2.5 million through the sale of 6.25 million shares of common stock in 2011.
The SEC also alleges that Mr. Whittle and others caused us to make public announcements which caused our stock price to rise,
which helped facilitate the alleged frauds among other allegations spelled out more completely in the complaint. The SEC s
complaint charges us, Mr. Whittle, Mr. Weaver, Mr. Sun, Mr. Berlinger, Mr. Wheatley, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Al-Barwani with conducting
an illegal offering in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The complaint further alleges that Mr. Whittle,
Mr. Weaver, Mr. Sun, Mr. Berlinger, and the Hunters violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Mr. Whittle,
Mr. Weaver, Mr. Sun, and Mr. Berlinger violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder. Mr. Whittle
is additionally charged with violating Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3, and the Hunters are charged with violations
of Sections 17(b) of the Securities Act, which prohibits fraudulent touting of stock. The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, and penalties as well as penny stock bars against all of the individual Defendants and an officer-and-director
bar against Mr. Whittle.  

On
or around May 31, 2016, the Company entered into a  Consent of Defendant Jammin Java Corp.  (the   Consent  ),
in connection with the SEC s complaint (the   Complaint  ). Pursuant to the Consent, without admitting
or denying the allegations of the Complaint (except as specifically set forth in such Consent mainly relating to personal and
subject matter jurisdiction, which we admitted), we consented to the entry of a final judgment (the   Final Judgment  ),
which, among other things: (a) permanently restrains and enjoins us from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, and (b) orders
us to pay disgorgement in the amount of $605,330, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $94,670, totaling an aggregate
of $700,000, of which (1) $200,000 is due within 14 days of the entry of the Final Judgment (which Final Judgment was entered
July 6, 2016, and which payment was due July 20, 2016, and has not been paid or requested by the SEC to date); and (2) $500,000
is due within 90 days of the entry of the Final Judgment (which amount was due by October 4, 2016, and which amount has not been
paid or requested by the SEC to date).  

The
Final Judgment was approved by the SEC on or around May 31, 2016 and approved by the court on July 6, 2016, which is
anticipated by the end of July 2016. The Company has accrued $700,000 for estimated settlement expense in the quarter ended
July 31, 2016, which is offset by a $400,000 insurance settlement which was received in May 2016.  

The
Company believes that the Final Judgment is a positive outcome for the Company as it settles the SEC s outstanding action
against the Company and removes the uncertainty surrounding such action moving forward. The Company continues to take action in
the best interests of the shareholders to create shareholder value which includes assisting the SEC in its continued investigation.  

On
August 1, 2016, 56 Hope Road and HRM filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
Los Angeles, Central Division (Case No. BC628981). The complaint (a) seeks a declaratory judgment relating to the termination
of the licenses, (b) seeks damages for our alleged (i) breaches of the Long-Term License and Short-Term License, (ii) tortious
interference with 56 Hope Road s and HRM s economic relationships with licenses and prospective licensees, and (iii)
trademark infringement; (c) requests an accounting of our books and records; and (d) requests punitive and exemplary damages in
connection with allegations of fraud and misrepresentation.  

On
August 4, 2016, we filed (a) a notice of removal with the court, requesting the case be removed from state court to the United
States District Court for the Central District of California; (b) a request for a temporary restraining order requesting the court
to reinstate the Short-Term License until a final decision on the pending lawsuit is determined; and (c) an answer to the complaint
denying the allegations of 56 Hope Road and HRM, including certain affirmative defenses, and pleading counterclaims against (i)
56 Hope Road for breach of contract and breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, (ii) 56 Hope Road and HRM
for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage and intentional and negligent misrepresentation,
and (iii) breach of fiduciary duty against Rohan Marley, our former Chairman, and seeking that the court enter judgment in favor
of us on all claims alleged by 56 Hope Road and HRM and further seeking economic damages, punitive and exemplary damages, pre-and-post
judgment interest and court costs from 56 Hope Road, HRM and Mr. Marley.  

The
case was then removed to the United States District Court of California Western Division (Case No. 2:16-cv-05810-SVW-MRW). 56
Hope Road and HRM subsequently amended their Complaint to seek damages for alleged breach of contract in connection with the Long-Term
License and Short-Term License, declaratory relief in connection with the Long-Term License and Short-Term License (i.e., that
such agreements have been effectively terminated by us), interference with prospective economic advantage, trademark infringement,
accountings, fraud, and indemnity. We denied the allegations, asserted certain several affirmative defenses and filed counterclaims
against Rohan Marley, our former director, for breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy, which claims 56 Hope Road, HRM and
Mr. Marley have moved to be dismissed. Trial is currently set for March 2017.  

We
vehemently deny the allegations made by 56 Hope Road and HRM, and plan to vigorously defend ourselves against the claims made
in the complaint. The Company has no basis of determining whether there is any likelihood of material loss associated with the
claims and/or the potential and/or the outcome of the litigation.  

Note
9. Concentrations   

A
significant portion of our revenue is derived from our relationships with a limited number of vendors and distributors. The loss
of one or more of our significant vendors or distributors would have a material impact on our revenues and results of operations.
During the three-month periods ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, three customers accounted for 49.3% and 47% of net revenues, respectively.  

During
the six month periods ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, two vendors accounted for 44% and 79% of purchases. The same two vendors accounted
for 75% and 86% of the accounts payable as of July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

For
the six month periods ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, total sales in Canada totaled $448,214 and $426,662 respectively.  

For
the six month periods ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, sales in South Korea totaled $7,951 and $461,048, respectively.  

For
the six month periods ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, sales in Chile totaled $353,635 and $608,638, respectively.

10. Subsequent Events   

Share
Issuances    

In September 2016, the Company issued
7,304,349 shares of common stock to employees and officers in consideration for accrued and unpaid compensation. 

November
2016 - Convertible Notes Payable  Vis Vires   

On  December
13, 2016, and effective November 15, 2016, we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note with Vis Vires in the
principal amount of $14,000 (the   December 2016 Vis Vires Note  ). The December 2016 Vis
Vires Note bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum (22% upon an event of default) and is due and payable on August 15,
2017. The principal amount of the December 2016 Vis Vires Note and all accrued interest is convertible at the option
of the holder at the greater of (a) 65% (a 35% discount) multiplied by the average of the lowest five closing bid prices
of our common stock during the ten trading days immediately prior to the date of any conversion and (b) $0.00009, provided
that the conversion price during major announcements (as described in the December 2016 Vis Vires Note) is the lower
of the conversion price on the announcement date of such major announcement and the conversion price on the date of
conversion. The December 2016 Vis Vires Note conversion price also includes anti-dilution protection such that in the
event we issue or are deemed to have issued common stock or convertible securities at a price equal to less than the
conversion price of the December 2016 Vis Vires Note in effect on the date of such issuance or deemed issuance, the
conversion price of the December 2016 Vis Vires Note is automatically reduced to such lower price, subject to certain
exceptions in the note. 

At
no time may the  December 2016 Vis Vires Note be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in Vis
Vires and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. 

We
may prepay in full the unpaid principal and interest on the  December 2016 Vis Vires Note, upon notice, any time prior
to the 180 th  day after the issuance date. Any prepayment is subject to payment of a prepayment amount ranging from
108% to 133% of the then outstanding balance on the December 2016 Vis Vires Note (inclusive of accrued and unpaid interest
and any default amounts then owing), depending on when such prepayment is made. 

The
 December 2016 Vis Vires Note also contains customary positive and negative covenants. 

10%
Convertible Promissory Note   

On
November 23, 2016 and effective November 14, 2016, we sold an accredited investor (the   10% Note Investor  )
a 10% Convertible Promissory Note with a face amount of $110,000, representing $24,000 borrowed from the 10% Note Investor and
a 10% original issue discount ($2,400), and up to $83,600 of potential future borrowings which may be made to use by the 10% Note
Investor in its sole discretion (the   10% Investor Note  ). The 10% Investor Note accrues interest at the rate
of 10% per annum (the lesser of 20% per annum and the highest rate allowed per law upon an event of default), and is due on November
14, 2017.  

The
10% Investor Note can be repaid by us prior to the 180 th  day after the issuance date thereof along with a prepayment
penalty, depending on when repaid, of between 100% and 150% of the principal amount owed thereunder, plus interest (provided that
any repayment of principal requires that we also repay the total amount of interest which would have accrued through maturity).
After the 180 th  day after the issuance date the note cannot be repaid without the written consent of 10% Note Investor.  

The
10% Investor Note provides for standard and customary events of default such as failing to timely make payments under the 10%
Investor Note when due and the failure of the Company to timely comply with Exchange Act reporting requirements, provided that
this Quarterly Report and our next Quarterly Report are excluded from such requirement. In the event the repayment of the note
is accelerated due to the occurrence of an event of default we are required to pay the 10% Note Investor 150% of the outstanding
principal amount of the note.  

The
amount owed under the 10% Investor Note is convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time after the 180 th
 day after the issuance date of thereof at the option of the 10% Note Investor, at a 35% discount (increasing by 10% if we
are placed on the   chilled   list with the DTC, increasing by 5% if we are not DWAC eligible, and increasing
by another 10% upon the occurrence of any event of default under the note) to the average of the lowest trading price of our common
stock during the 25 trading days prior to the date of conversion.  

At
no time may the 10% Investor Note be converted into shares of our common stock if such conversion would result in the 10% Note
Investor and its affiliates owning an aggregate of in excess of 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock.  

Additionally,
if at any time while the Note is outstanding, we receive any written or oral proposal (the   Proposal  ) containing
one or more offers to provide additional capital or equity or debt financing, we are required to provide a copy of all documents
received relating to the Proposal together with a complete and accurate description of the Proposal to the 10% Note Investor and,
subject to the terms of the note, the 10% Note Investor is provided the right of first refusal to provide such financing on the
terms set forth in the Proposal.  

We
hope to repay the 10% Investor Note prior to any conversion. In the event that the 10% Investor Note is not repaid in cash in
its entirety, Company shareholders may suffer dilution if and to the extent that the balance of the 10% Investor Note is converted
into common stock.  

Additional
JMJ Borrowing   

On
November 28, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $8,500 from JMJ which was evidenced by the JMJ Convertible Note described
above.  

December 2016 JSJ Convertible Note  

On December 5, 2016, we entered into a 12%
Convertible Note with JSJ (the   December 2016 JSJ Convertible Note  ) in the amount of $15,500. The December
2016 JSJ Convertible Note accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum (18% upon the occurrence of an event of default) through
maturity, September 5, 2017. We have the right to prepay the note prior to maturity provided we pay 150% of the amount due. 

The December 2016 JSJ Convertible Note and
all accrued interest is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into the Company s common stock at any time after
the 180 th  day following the date of the note. The conversion price of the December 2016 JSJ Convertible Note is the
greatest of a) 60% (a 40% discount) to the third lowest intra-day trading price of the Company s common stock during the
10 trading days prior to any conversion date of the note, or b) $0.00005. In the event that the note is not repaid in cash in its
entirety, Company shareholders may suffer dilution if and to the extent that the balance of the JSJ Note is converted into common
stock.

Overview   

We
provide premium roasted coffee and specialty coffee on a wholesale level to the service, hospitality, office coffee service and
big box store markets, as well as to a variety of other business channels. Specifically, we currently provide award winning sustainably
grown, ethically-farmed and artisan roasted gourmet coffee through multiple United States and international distribution channels.
We intend to develop a significant share of these markets and achieve a leadership position by capitalizing on the global recognition
of the   Marley   brand name, subject to our ability to retain the license rights to the   Marley  
name which we are currently in litigation regarding, as described below. We hope to capitalize on the guidance and leadership
of our management team, and to increase our sales through the marketing of products. Additionally, through a licensing agreement
with the family of the late reggae performer, Robert Nesta Marley, professionally known as Bob Marley (whose family members include
Rohan Marley, our former Chairman and the son of Bob Marley)(as described below), which we are currently in litigation to attempt
to stop from being terminated, we are provided the worldwide right to use the name   Marley Coffee   and reasonably
similar variations thereof.  

We
believe the key to our growth is a multichannel distribution and sales strategy. Since August 2011, we have been introducing a
wide variety of coffee products through multiple distribution channels using the Marley Coffee brand name. The main channels of
revenue for the Company are now and are expected to continue to be domestic retail in both grocery and away from home (for example,
consumption at the office and on the go), international distribution, and online retail.  

In
order to market our products in these channels, we have developed a variety of coffee products in varying formats. The Company
offers an entire line of coffee in whole bean and ground form with varying sizes including 2.5 ounce (oz), 8oz, 12oz and 2 pound
(lbs) sizes. The Company also offers a   single serve   solution with its compostable Single-Serve Pods for Bunn 
and other pod-based home and office brewers. The Company recently launched its Marley Coffee recyclable RealCup; compatible cartridges,
for use in most models of Keurig  s K-Cup brewing system.  

We
have also started to develop a suite of products under the Jammin Java Coffee brand to complement our existing lines of coffee.  

License
Agreement with Fifty-Six Hope Road Music Limited   

On
September 13, 2012, the Company entered into a fifteen (15) year license agreement (renewable for two additional fifteen (15)
year terms thereafter in the option of the Company) with an effective date of August 7, 2012 with Fifty-Six Hope Road Music Limited,
a Bahamas international business company (  56 Hope Road   and the   Long-Term License  ). Rohan
Marley, our former Chairman, owns an interest in and serves as a director of 56 Hope Road. Pursuant to the Long-Term License,
56 Hope Road granted the Company a worldwide, exclusive, non-transferable license to utilize the   Marley Coffee  
trademarks (the   Trademarks  ) in connection with (i) the manufacturing, advertising, promotion, sale, offering
for sale and distribution of coffee in all its forms and derivations, regardless of portions, sizes or packaging (the   Exclusive
Licensed Products  ) and (ii) coffee roasting services, coffee production services, and coffee sales, supply, distribution
and support services, provided that the Company may not open retail coffee houses utilizing the Trademarks. 56 Hope Road owns
and controls the intellectual property rights in and to the late reggae performer, Robert Nesta Marley, professionally known as
Bob Marley, including the Trademarks. In addition, 56 Hope Road granted the Company the right to use the Trademarks on advertising
and promotional materials that pertain solely to the sale of coffee cups, coffee mugs, coffee glasses, saucers, milk steamers,
machines for brewing coffee, espresso and/or cappuccino, grinders, water treatment products, tea products, chocolate products,
and ready-to-use (instant) coffee products (the   Non-Exclusive Licensed Products  , and together with the Exclusive
Licensed Products, the   Licensed Products  ). Licensed Products may be sold by the Company pursuant to the Long-Term
License through all channels of distribution, provided that, subject to certain exceptions, the Company cannot sell the Licensed
Products by direct marketing methods (other than the Company s website), including television, infomercials or direct mail
without the prior written consent of 56 Hope Road. Additionally, 56 Hope Road has the right to approve all Licensed Products,
all advertisements in connection therewith and all product designs and packaging. The agreement also provides that 56 Hope Road
shall own all rights to any domain names (including marleycoffee.com), incorporating the Trademarks.  

2  

In
consideration for the foregoing licenses, the Company agreed to pay royalties to 56 Hope Road in an amount equal to 3% of the
net sales of all Licensed Products on a quarterly basis. In addition, such royalty payments are to be deferred during the first
20 months of the term of the Long-Term License, and such deferred payments shall be paid on a quarterly-basis thereafter until
paid in full. For the six months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, $128,587 and $58,609, respectively, was incurred for such
royalty fees. The total accounts payable to 56 Hope Road, a related party, as of July 31, 2016 is $347,412.  

Short
Term License Agreement and Promissory Note   

On
June 27, 2016, and effective June 24, 2016, 56 Hope Road provided us notice of the termination of the Long-Term License. 56 Hope
Road terminated the Long-Term License due to our alleged breach of certain of the terms of the Long-Term License agreement, including,
but not limited to, our failure to deliver quarterly statements in a timely manner, our failure to timely make licensing payments,
our failure to deliver audited financial statements in a timely manner, and the Securities and Exchange Commission s complaint
against us. Some of these breaches were due to cash flow issues and corporate governance matters.  

The
immediate effect of the termination of the Long-Term License was minimal, as effective immediately thereafter we entered into
the Short-Term License described below.  

On
July 6, 2016, (1) we and Hope Road Merchandising, LLC (  HRM  ), which exclusively controls all licensing of
56 Hope Road s intellectual property rights, entered into a Short Term License Agreement (the   Short-Term License  );
(2) we entered into a Secured Promissory Note in favor of 56 Hope Road (the   Secured Note  ); and (3) we and
56 Hope Road entered into a Security Agreement to secure amounts owed under the Secured Note, each as described in greater detail
below.  

The
Short-Term License provides us the right to use the Trademarks from June 27, 2016 until December 27, 2016 (a term of six months)(subject
to HRM s right to terminate the license in the event we breach the terms thereof or any of the terms of the Secured Note
or Security Agreement), provided that the Short-Term License can be extended in the sole discretion of HRM (at our request) for
an additional six month term after expiration thereof. Other than the term of the agreement, the Short-Term License has substantially
similar terms as the Long-Term License (except as discussed above), with the addition of requiring us to provide customer and
vendor lists to HRM and providing HRM an irrevocable license to use such information. Additional requirements associated with
our entry into the Short-Term License with HRM was that (i) we immediately provide all deficient quarterly and annual statements
due; and (ii) we allow 56 Hope Road or its affiliates to have discussions with our current and potential business partners relating
to whether there is a basis for a continued relationship with us, and to have discussions with unrelated third parties that 56
Hope Road may have an interest in once the Short-Term License expires.  

The
Secured Note evidences $297,324 due to 56 Hope Road pursuant to the terms of the Long-Term License, which amount accrues interest
until paid at 0.71% per annum (7.5% per annum if not paid in full at maturity) and was due and payable on August 31, 2016, but
has not been repaid to date and is currently in default. Amounts due under the Secured Note are secured by the Security Agreement.
The Secured Note contains customary representations and events of default.  

The
Security Agreement provides 56 Hope Road a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure our payment of the Secured
Note.  

3  

56
Hope Road/HRM Purported License Termination and Lawsuit    

On
July 21, 2016, HRM and 56 Hope Road provided us notice of the termination of the Short-Term License, and demanded that all use
of the Trademarks cease immediately.  

56
Hope Road terminated the Short-Term License, due to our alleged breach of certain of the terms of the Short-Term License, including,
but not limited to, our failure to deliver quarterly statements and annual audited financial statements in a timely manner, and
issues raised regarding security interests alleged to have been granted by us in connection with the licenses, to various third
parties in alleged violation of the licenses, which we were alleged to have not timely cured.  

We
believe that the termination notice received on July 21, 2016 as well as the termination of the Long-Term License, was without
merit and that 56 Hope Road has no reasonable basis for such terminations.  

After
we received the July 21, 2016, notice of termination, both sides worked to resolve the termination and to negotiate a forbearance
of the alleged defaults. One of the conditions of the forbearance set by HRM was for the Company to engage a restructuring consultant
to provide a picture of the Company and a potential turnaround plan. After discussion between the parties, both we and HRM agreed
that we would engage r 2  advisors llc (  R2  ), a company with whom neither we nor HRM had any
prior relationship. R2 provided the preliminary assessment of the Company; however, after the preliminary assessment was prepared,
HRM s representatives determined that the assessment was biased towards the Company and unfairly promoted the Company s
point of view. We vigorously disagree with this assessment.  

Notwithstanding
our attempt to work in good faith through the issues raised with HRM in the termination notice, and without prior notice, on August
1, 2016, 56 Hope Road and HRM filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles,
Central Division (Case No. BC628981). The complaint (a) seeks a declaratory judgment relating to the termination of the licenses,
(b) seeks damages for our alleged (i) breaches of the Long-Term License and Short-Term License, (ii) tortious interference with
56 Hope Road s and HRM s economic relationships with licenses and prospective licensees, and (iii) trademark infringement;
(c) requests an accounting of our books and records; and (d) requests punitive and exemplary damages in connection with allegations
of fraud and misrepresentation.  

On
August 4, 2016, we filed (a) a notice of removal with the court, requesting the case be removed from state court to the United
States District Court for the Central District of California; (b) a request for a temporary restraining order requesting the court
to reinstate the Short-Term License until a final decision on the pending lawsuit is determined; and (c) an answer to the complaint
denying the allegations of 56 Hope Road and HRM, including certain affirmative defenses, and pleading counterclaims against (i)
56 Hope Road for breach of contract and breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, (ii) 56 Hope Road and HRM
for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage and intentional and negligent misrepresentation,
and (iii) breach of fiduciary duty against Rohan Marley, our former Chairman, and seeking that the court enter judgment in favor
of us on all claims alleged by 56 Hope Road and HRM and further seeking economic damages, punitive and exemplary damages, pre-and-post
judgment interest and court costs from 56 Hope Road, HRM and Mr. Marley.  

The
case was then removed to the United States District Court of California Western Division (Case No. 2:16-cv-05810-SVW-MRW). 56
Hope Road and HRM subsequently amended their Complaint to seek damages for alleged breach of contract in connection with the Long-Term
License and Short-Term License, declaratory relief in connection with the Long-Term License and Short-Term License (i.e., that
such agreements have been effectively terminated by us), interference with prospective economic advantage, trademark infringement,
accountings, fraud, and indemnity. We denied the allegations, asserted certain several affirmative defenses and filed counterclaims
against Rohan Marley, our former director, for breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy, which claims 56 Hope Road, HRM and
Mr. Marley have moved to be dismissed. Trial is currently set for March 2017.  

We
vehemently deny the allegations made by 56 Hope Road and HRM, and plan to vigorously defend ourselves against the claims made
in the complaint. The Company has no basis of determining whether there is any likelihood of material loss associated with the
claims and/or the potential and/or the outcome of the litigation.  

4  

Current
Status of Business Operations   

As
described above, we are currently in litigation with 56 Hope Road and HRM. Additionally, since the date of our last filing, we
have attempted to streamline our business and cut costs while maintaining as many accounts as possible. Additionally, we ve
been working on expanding our operations outside of the   Marley Coffee   name. Meanwhile, we have tried to work
with 56 Hope Road and HRM to come to a viable business solution for the current litigation, but to date, they are not willing
to compromise.  

Since
the litigation began, we have worked to both maintain and restructure our business. We have cut costs across the board, closed
our main office and reduced our employee head count. Our focus is on the maintenance of accounts to ensure we have sufficient
cash flow to keep the business afloat while seeking alternative growth options.  

We
are not looking at bankruptcy restructuring as an option at the moment, as we are trying to sustain the business, grow a new division,
and continue with our litigation. We have worked with our two largest debt holders in an effort to restructure our debt. Specifically,
Mother Parkers has agreed that all profits and licensing fees from coffee which we sell through Mother Parkers will go to pay
down debt which we owe to Mother Parkers. Our other significant creditor [ERI] is providing us credit to ship products to our
customers for all bagged coffee; however, we are allocating 30% of the profits of such orders back to ERI to pay down our debt
owed to them. We also have several other smaller debt holders that we have structured a payment plan with, and some we have not.
We cannot guarantee that a debt holder will not try to put us into involuntary bankruptcy, but we currently have no intention
at this time of filing for any type of bankruptcy protection.  

The
litigation is ongoing with a March 2017 trial date now set. At this time, the litigation has not resulted in the Company being
ordered to stop using the Trademarks. We are seeking damages and a full legal recognition of the validity of our license with
56 Hope Road as part of our counterclaims in the litigation.  

Credit
is still tight, although we have been able to structure a credit deal with National Coffee Roasters for our ground and whole bean
products. We are also currently seeking additional funds to help with single serve capsule fulfillment.  

Separately,
we are developing a line of non- Marley Coffee  related products under the Jammin Java name, which we plan to distribute
through our existing channels with a planned launch date of no later than February 2017. This line of products will feature premium
coffee in a number of formats, including ground, whole bean, and Keurig , Nespresso , and Dolce Gusto  compatible
single serve capsules.  

We
have already discussed our new brand with current and potential customers and have received positive feedback and commitments
to order once we launch. These products will not require us to pay licensing fees. We anticipate beginning to generate revenues
from these sales starting mid-February 2017.  

We
are also looking at a potential acquisition opportunities in the roasting and distribution space. We have built a robust distribution
network with strong connections to our customers and their buyers over the past several years and we believe that we can succeed
in growing another brand as we have done previously with  Marley Coffee .  

We
need to raise additional cash in order to pay our expenses and repay our outstanding promissory notes and other liabilities. If
we are unable to access additional capital moving forward, it will hurt our ability to maintain growth and possibly jeopardize
our ability to maintain our current operations. We may not be able to increase sales, reduce expenses or obtain additional financing,
if necessary, at a level to meet our current obligations to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is focused on growing revenue while working to lower cost of sales and operating expenses, with the ultimate goal of generating
net income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Since our inception, we
have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of our common stock. 

The following table presents
details of our working capital and cash and cash equivalents: 

7  

At July 31, 2016, we had
total assets of $1,580,272 and total liabilities of $8,115,078. Our current sources of liquidity include our existing cash and
cash equivalents, cash from operations and borrowings under convertible promissory notes and other loans. For the six months ended
July 31, 2016, we generated net sales of $4,425,782 and we had a net loss of $4,381,788. 

Total current assets of
$957,739 as of July 31, 2016 included cash of $137,561, accounts receivable of $714,069 (which included $430,325 due from Mother
Parkers), other current assets of $3,000 and $103,109 of prepaid expenses. 

We had total assets as
of July 31, 2016 of $1,580,272 which included the total current assets of $957,739, $123,523 of property and equipment, net, $477,694
of intangible assets and $21,316 of other assets. 

We had total liabilities
of $8,115,078 as of July 31, 2016, which were primarily current liabilities and included $3,939,549 of accounts payable (which
included $2,169,533 of accounts payable to Mother Parkers, $347,412 royalty   related party relating to amounts accrued in
connection with the 56 Hope Road License Agreements (described above)), $1,196,654 of accrued expenses and $1,475,376 of notes
payable, net of discount, in connection with short term financing agreements and a capital lease we entered into, as described
in greater detail in Notes 5 and 8 to the financial statements included herein, and $1,503,500 conversion feature   derivative
liability. 

We source coffee that
we sell to our roaster, Mother Parkers, a related party and shareholder of the Company, who in turn sells it to its own customers.
This is especially the case with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee secured by us. At July 31, 2016, we are owed $430,325 by Mother
Parkers. We also utilize the services of Mother Parkers, to roast coffee to our specifications for sale to the Company s
customers. As a result, at July 31, 2016, we owe $2,174,916 to Mother Parkers for roasting services. 

The Company incurred a
net loss of $4,381,788 and $2,165,731 for the six months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively and had an accumulated deficit
of $33,627,538 at July 31, 2016.   In addition, the Company has a history of losses and has not generated net income
from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
operations of the Company have primarily been funded by the sale of common stock and debt financing. The Company s ability
to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon its ability to sell its products directly to end-users
and through distributors, establish profitable operations through increased sales and decreased expenses, and obtain additional
funds when needed. We may not be able to increase sales or reduce expenses to a level necessary to meet our current obligations
or continue as a going concern. As a result, the opinion the Company received from its independent registered public accounting
firm on its January 31, 2016 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt regarding
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to
liquidate our assets, and may realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements,
and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. The accompanying financial statements do not contain
any adjustments for this uncertainty. 

Cash Flows  

8  

Operating Activities  

For the six months ended
July 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $141,666, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $680,823
for the six months ended July 31, 2015, an increase of $822,489. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended
July 31, 2016 was primarily due to $4,381,788 of net loss, offset by $644,983 change in fair value of derivative liability and
share-based employee compensation of $852,462. 

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing
activities for the six months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, was solely due to the purchase and disposal of property and equipment. 

Financing Activities  

Compared to the corresponding
period in fiscal 2015, net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $458,984 for the six months ended July
31, 2016 due to reduced short term borrowings. 

From time to time, we
may attempt to raise capital through either equity or debt offerings. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including,
among other things, the rate at which our business grows, with corresponding demands for working capital and expansion capacity.
We could be required, or may elect, to seek additional funding through public or private equity, debt financing or bank financing. 

Funding and Financing Agreements  

Mother Parker s Investment  

On April 24, 2014, the
Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with Mother Parkers Tea   Coffee Inc. (  Mother Parkers  
and the   Subscription  ). Pursuant to the Subscription, Mother Parkers purchased 7,333,529 units from the Company,
each consisting of (a) one share of the Company s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the   Shares  );
and (b) one (1) warrant to purchase one share of the Company s common stock (the   Warrants   and collectively
with the Shares, the   Units  ) at a price per Unit equal to the fifty day weighted-average price per share
of the Company s common stock on the OTCQB market, for the fifty trading days ending March 7, 2014 (the date the parties
first discussed the transactions contemplated by the Subscription), which was $0.3409 (the   Per Unit Price  ).
The total purchase price paid for the Units was $2,500,000. 

Pursuant to the Subscription,
we provided Mother Parkers a right of first refusal for a period of two (2) years following the Subscription (which has now expired),
to purchase up to 10% of any securities (common stock, options or warrants exercisable for common stock) we propose to offer and
sell in a public or private equity offering (the   ROFO Securities  ), exercisable for 48 hours from the time
we provide Mother Parkers notice of such proposed sale of ROFO Securities (subject where applicable to Mother Parkers meeting any
prerequisites to participation in the offering). The right of first refusal does not apply to the issuance of (a) shares of common
stock or options to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company in consideration for services, (b) securities
exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the date of the Subscription,
(c) securities issued pursuant to acquisitions or strategic transactions approved by the directors of the Company, provided that
any such issuance shall provide the Company additional benefits in addition to the investment of funds, but shall not include a
transaction in which the Company is issuing securities primarily for the purpose of raising capital, and (d) any debt securities
(other than any debt securities exchangeable for or convertible into shares of common stock). 

The Warrants have an exercise
price equal to 150% of the Per Unit Price ($0.51135 per share), a term of three years and prohibit Mother Parkers from exercising
such Warrants to the extent such exercise would result in the beneficial ownership of more than 9.99% of the Company s common
stock, subject to Mother Parkers  right to waive such limitation with 61 days prior written notice. 

As described above, we
also had $430,325 of accounts receivable due from, and $2,174,916 of accounts payable owed to, Mother Parkers, as of July 31, 2016.

Line of Credit

from the lender from time to time. On March 26, 2015, the lender advanced $250,000 to us under the terms of the line of credit.
Amounts owed under the line of credit are to be memorialized by revolving credit notes in the form attached to the line of credit,
provided that no formal note has been entered into to advance amounts borrowed to date. Amounts borrowed under the line of credit
accrue interest at the rate of 17.5% per annum and can be repaid at any time without penalty. A total of 10% of the interest rate
is payable in cash and the other 7.5% of the interest rate is payable in cash, or at the option of the lender and with our consent,
or by a reduction in amounts owed to us by the lender in connection with the sale of coffee or other promotional activities. The
line of credit expires, and all amounts are due under the line of credit on September 26, 2016. The line of credit contains customary
events of default, and upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender can suspend further advances and require the Company
to declare the entire amount then owed immediately due, subject to a 10 day period pursuant to which we have the right to cure
any default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default the amounts owed under the line of credit bear interest at the rate of
20% per annum. Proceeds from the line of credit can be solely used for working capital purposes. The lender has no relationship
with the Company or its affiliates. The total due on the third party loans as of July 31, 2016 was $1,813,829.

10  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As part of our on-going
business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (  SPEs  ),
which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow
or limited purposes. As of July 31, 2016, we are not involved in any unconsolidated SPEs. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements. 

Stock-Based Compensation.  On
January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 718 which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service. We utilize the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially
affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require
significant analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions will be based on, or determined
from, external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock-based payment arrangements.
The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances. 

We estimated volatility
by considering historical stock volatility. We have opted to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of stock
options equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term. 

Revenue Recognition.  All
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service or sale is complete, the price is fixed or
determinable and ability to collect is reasonably assured. Revenue is derived from the sale of coffee products and is recognized
on a gross basis upon shipment. The Company utilizes a third party for the production and fulfillment of orders placed by customers.
Customers order directly from the Company and accordingly, the Company acts as a principal, takes title to the products, and has
the risks and rewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery and returns. 

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets . Long-lived assets include a license agreement that was recorded at the estimated cost to acquire the asset (See
Note 4 to the financial statements included in this report). The license agreement is reviewed for impairment when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based
on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event
that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down
to their estimated fair values. Management evaluated the carrying value of the license and determined that no impairment existed
at July 31, 2016 or 2015. 

Accounts Receivable
allowance .   A provision for doubtful accounts is provided based on a combination of historical experience, specific
identification and customer credit risk where there are indications that a specific customer may be experiencing financial difficulties. 

11  

Inventory Reserves.  We
estimate any required write-downs for inventory obsolescence by examining our inventories on a quarterly basis to determine if
there are indicators that the carrying values could exceed net realizable value. Indicators that could result in additional inventory
write-downs include age of inventory, damaged inventory, slow moving products and products at the end of their life cycles. While
significant judgment is involved in determining the net realizable value of inventory, we believe that inventory is appropriately
stated at the lower of cost or market. 

Deferred Tax Asset
Valuation Allowance.  We follow the provisions of ASC 740 relating to uncertain tax provisions and have commenced analyzing
filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all
open tax years in these jurisdictions. As a result of adoption, no additional tax liabilities have been recorded. The Company files
income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in certain state jurisdictions. The Company has not been subjected to tax
examinations for any year and the statute of limitations has not expired. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax benefits or consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Judgment is required
in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing
a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets. To the extent future taxable income against
which these assets may be applied is not sufficient, some portion or all of our recorded deferred tax assets would not be realizable. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

For the six months ended
July 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no accounting standards or interpretations issued that are expected to have a material impact
on our financial position, operations or cash flows. 

Accounting standards that
have been issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are being evaluated
by the Company to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. Such pronouncements
include the following: 

Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU 2016-02    Leases (Topic 842)    - In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as
either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease
accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain
changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
18, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will
have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

ASB ASU 2014-09    Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),    or ASU 2014-09 - In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which
supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605   Revenue Recognition.  
This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with the option to adopt as early as December
15, 2017. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
financial position. 

In June 2014, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2014-12,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of
an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  (  ASU 2014-12  ).
The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service
period, be treated as a performance condition. The guidance will be effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, if any,
on its financial statements. 

Management is evaluating
the significance of the recent accounting pronouncement ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (subtopic
205-40); disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, and has not yet concluded
whether the pronouncement will have a significant effect on the Company s future financial statements. Such standard
is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning February 1, 2017.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.  

Pursuant to Item 305(e)
of Regulation S-K (  229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a
  smaller reporting company,   as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

Our management, with the
participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting and Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange
Act  ) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on our evaluation,
our Principal Executive Officer and Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to ensure the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

Internal control over
financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in
judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion
or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features
of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate,
this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. 

A material weakness is
a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above, management
identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at January 31, 2016: 

(1) 
     lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board of Directors capable to oversee the audit function; and  

(2) 
     ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.  

Management believes that
the material weaknesses set forth in items (1) and (2) above did not have an effect on the Company s financial reporting
during the three months ended July 31, 2016. 

Internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation
of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Disclosure controls generally
include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file with
the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

13  

Effective internal controls
over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial and other reports
and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot maintain effective internal controls or provide reliable financial or SEC reports or
prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our SEC reports, our operating results and the trading price of our common stock
could suffer and we might become subject to litigation. 

Because we are a small
company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and
the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management,
and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner. 

As a public reporting
company, we must comply with the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including certain corporate governance provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules and regulations of the SEC,
with which a private company is not required to comply. Complying with these laws, rules and regulations will occupy a significant
amount of time of our sole director and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses, which we cannot estimate
accurately at this time. Among other things, we must: 

establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;  

prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;  

maintain various internal compliance and disclosures policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading in our common stock; and  

involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.  

We are committed to improving
our financial organization. As part of this commitment, moving forward, at such time as we are able to raise additional funding,
we plan to hire additional outside accounting personnel and take action to consolidate check writing and financial controls. Additionally,
as soon as funds are available, we plan to make a determination as to whether it is in the Company s best interest to (1)
appoint one or more outside directors to our Board of Directors to be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting
in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures; (2) create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel
resources; (3) hire independent third parties to provide expert advice; and (4) prepare and implement sufficient written policies
and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

We will continue to monitor
and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an
ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary
and as funds allow. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended July 31, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

14  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

From
time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course
of our business. 

On
September 30, 2014, Shane Whittle, individually, a former significant shareholder and officer and director of the Company (  Whittle  ),
and derivatively on behalf of Marley Coffee LLC (  MC LLC  ) filed a complaint against Rohan Marley, Cedella Marley,
the Company, HRM, 56 Hope Road, and Marley Coffee Estate Limited (  Marley Coffee Estate  ) in the United States
District Court for the District of Colorado (Civil Action No. 2014-CV-2680). 

The
complaint alleged that Whittle entered into a partnership with Rohan Marley, the son of the late reggae music legend Robert Nesta
Marley p/k/a Bob Marley, to sell premium coffee products branded after the name and likeness of Rohan Marley. The causes of action
set forth in the complaint included, among others, racketeering activity, trademark infringement, breach of fiduciary duty, civil
theft, and civil conspiracy (some of which causes of action were not directly alleged against the Company), which were alleged
to have directly caused Whittle and MCL substantial financial harm. Damages claimed by Whittle and MCL included economic damages
to be proven at trial, profits made by defendants, treble damages, punitive damages, attorneys  fees and pre and post judgment
interest. 

Effective on May 19, 2016,
Whittle, MCL, Rohan Marley, Cedella Marley, the Company, HRM and 56 Hope Road entered into a Settlement Agreement in connection
with the proceeding described above (at the same time Whittle entered into a separate settlement agreement with Marley Coffee Estate).
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, (a) Whittle agreed to resign as a manager of MCL, assign his approximate 29% membership interest
in MCL to MCL for $1.00 of total consideration, and also consented to the redemption of certain other outstanding membership interests
in such entity; (b) Whittle agreed to cancel and terminate the options to purchase 2 million shares of the Company s common
stock which he held as of the date of the parties  entry into the Settlement Agreement for $1.00 of total consideration;
(c) Whittle agreed to release and waive any rights to any past due or future due payments owed by the Company under the Settlement
described above, including releasing the remaining amount of $10,000 which Whittle was due pursuant to such Settlement; (d) Whittle
provided a general release to each of the defendants (including the Company and Rohan Marley) from all claims, liability and obligations
which Whittle had against such defendants; and (e) each of the defendants (including the Company and Rohan Marley) provided Whittle
a general release from all claims, liability and obligations which such defendants had against Whittle. 

In connection with the
entry into the Settlement Agreement and the settlement of the lawsuit, the lawsuit described above was dismissed. 

On
November 17, 2015, the SEC filed a complaint against us (Case 2:15-cv-08921) in the United States District Court Central District
of California Western Division. Also included as defendants in the complaint were Shane G. Whittle (our former Chief Executive
Officer and Director) and parties unrelated to us, Wayne S. P. Weaver, Michael K. Sun, Rene Berlinger, Stephen B. Wheatley, Kevin
P. Miller, Mohammed A. Al-Barwani, Alexander J. Hunter, and Thomas E. Hunter (collectively, the   Defendants  ).
Pursuant to the complaint, the SEC alleged that Mr. Whittle orchestrated a   pump and dump   scheme with certain
other of the Defendants in connection with our common stock. The scheme allegedly involved utilizing our July 2009 reverse merger
transaction to secretly gain control of millions of our shares, spreading the stock to offshore entities, and dumping the shares
on the unsuspecting public after the stock price soared following fraudulent promotional campaigns undertaken by Mr. Whittle and
certain other of the Defendants in or around 2011. The complaint also alleges that to boost our stock price and provide cash to
the Company, Mr. Whittle and certain other of the Defendants orchestrated a sham financing arrangement designed to create the false
appearance of legitimate third-party interest and investment in the Company through a non-existent entity, Straight Path Capital,
pursuant to which we raised approximately $2.5 million through the sale of 6.25 million shares of common stock in 2011. The SEC
also alleges that Mr. Whittle and others caused us to make public announcements which caused our stock price to rise, which helped
facilitate the alleged frauds among other allegations spelled out more completely in the complaint. The SEC s complaint charges
us, Mr. Whittle, Mr. Weaver, Mr. Sun, Mr. Berlinger, Mr. Wheatley, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Al-Barwani with conducting an illegal offering
in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The complaint further alleges that Mr. Whittle, Mr. Weaver, Mr. Sun,
Mr. Berlinger, and the Hunters violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and Mr. Whittle, Mr. Weaver, Mr. Sun,
and Mr. Berlinger violated Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2 thereunder. Mr. Whittle is additionally
charged with violating Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3, and the Hunters are charged with violations of Sections
17(b) of the Securities Act, which prohibits fraudulent touting of stock. The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment
interest, and penalties as well as penny stock bars against all of the individual Defendants and an officer-and-director bar against
Mr. Whittle. 

15  

On
or around May 31, 2016, the Company entered into a  Consent of Defendant Jammin Java Corp.  (the   Consent  ),
in connection with the SEC s complaint (the   Complaint  ). Pursuant to the Consent, without admitting or
denying the allegations of the Complaint (except as specifically set forth in such Consent mainly relating to personal and subject
matter jurisdiction, which we admitted), we consented to the entry of a final judgment (the   Final Judgment  ),
which, among other things: (a) permanently restrains and enjoins us from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act, and (b) orders
us to pay disgorgement in the amount of $605,330, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $94,670, totaling an aggregate
of $700,000, of which (1) $200,000 is due within 14 days of the entry of the Final Judgment (which Final Judgment was entered July
6, 2016, and which payment was due July 20, 2016, and has not been paid or requested by the SEC to date); and (2) $500,000 is due
within 90 days of the entry of the Final Judgment (which amount was due by October 4, 2016, and which amount has not been paid
or requested by the SEC to date). 

The Final Judgment was
approved by the SEC on or around May 31, 2016 and approved by the court on July 6, 2016, which is anticipated by the end of June
2016. The Company has accrued $700,000 for estimated settlement expense in the quarter ended July 31, 2016, which is offset by
a $400,000 insurance settlement which was received in May 2016.   

The Company believes that
the Final Judgment is a positive outcome for the Company as it settles the SEC s outstanding action against the Company and
removes the uncertainty surrounding such action moving forward. The Company continues to take action in the best interests
of the shareholders to create shareholder value which includes assisting the SEC in its continued investigation. 

On August 1, 2016, 56
Hope Road and HRM filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central
Division (Case No. BC628981). The complaint (a) seeks a declaratory judgment relating to the termination of the licenses, (b) seeks
damages for our alleged (i) breaches of the Long-Term License and Short-Term License, (ii) tortious interference with 56 Hope Road s
and HRM s economic relationships with licenses and prospective licensees, and (iii) trademark infringement; (c) requests
an accounting of our books and records; and (d) requests punitive and exemplary damages in connection with allegations of fraud
and misrepresentation. 

On August 4, 2016, we
filed (a) a notice of removal with the court, requesting the case be removed from state court to the United States District Court
for the Central District of California; (b) a request for a temporary restraining order requesting the court to reinstate the Short-Term
License until a final decision on the pending lawsuit is determined; and (c) an answer to the complaint denying the allegations
of 56 Hope Road and HRM, including certain affirmative defenses, and pleading counterclaims against (i) 56 Hope Road for breach
of contract and breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, (ii) 56 Hope Road and HRM for intentional and negligent
interference with prospective economic advantage and intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and (iii) breach of fiduciary
duty against Rohan Marley, our former Chairman, and seeking that the court enter judgment in favor of us on all claims alleged
by 56 Hope Road and HRM and further seeking economic damages, punitive and exemplary damages, pre-and-post judgment interest and
court costs from 56 Hope Road, HRM and Mr. Marley. 

The case was then removed
to the United States District Court of California Western Division (Case No. 2:16-cv-05810-SVW-MRW). 56 Hope Road and HRM subsequently
amended their Complaint to seek damages for alleged breach of contract in connection with the Long-Term License and Short-Term
License, declaratory relief in connection with the Long-Term License and Short-Term License (i.e., that such agreements have been
effectively terminated by us), interference with prospective economic advantage, trademark infringement, accountings, fraud, and
indemnity. We denied the allegations, asserted certain several affirmative defenses and filed counterclaims against Rohan Marley,
our former director, for breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy, which claims 56 Hope Road, HRM and Mr. Marley have moved
to be dismissed. Trial is currently set for March 2017. 

16  

We vehemently deny the
allegations made by 56 Hope Road and HRM, and plan to vigorously defend ourselves against the claims made in the complaint. The
Company has no basis of determining whether there is any likelihood of material loss associated with the claims and/or the potential
and/or the outcome of the litigation. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

There have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January
31, 2016, filed with the Commission on May 6, 2016, except as discussed below, and investors are encouraged to review such risk
factors prior to making an investment in the Company. 

56 Hope Road has
attempted to terminate the Long-Term License and Short-Term License and terminate our ability to use the Trademarks and we are
currently in litigation with 56 Hope Road regarding our use of such Trademarks.   

As described above, 56
Hope Road has attempted to terminate the Long-Term License and Short-Term License and terminate our ability to use the Trademarks
and we are currently in litigation with 56 Hope Road and its affiliate HRM regarding such agreements and rights. In the even the
Long-Term License, Short-Term License and our rights to use the Trademarks are terminated, it would have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and assets, could force us to scale back and/or abandon our business operations, or force us to seek
bankruptcy protection and could cause the value of our common stock to decline in value or become worthless. Additionally, we could
be forced to pay significant damages and fees to 56 Hope Road and HRM in the event of an unfavorable outcome of the lawsuit, which
could force us to seek bankruptcy protection. 

The
Company owes a significant amount of money to Mother Parkers.   

As
of July 31, 2016, the Company owed a significant amount of accounts payable and the Company owed approximately $2.2 million to
Mother Parkers in consideration for distribution services rendered. Mother Parkers has previously advised us that if we are not
able to pay them amounts due past the 120 day net terms they have provided us, they will not provide additional credit and will
stop distributing our products. We currently owe Mother Parkers invoices from October 2015 and are not below the 120 days. As described
above, Mother Parkers is one of our largest distributors, representing over half of our revenues for the year ended January 31,
2016 and the three months ended July 31, 2016, and in the event they stop distributing our products our results of operations will
be materially adversely effected and we may be forced to curtail or abandon our business operations. We recently raised funding
through the sale of convertible notes, as described above, to pay down a portion of the amounts we owed to Mother Parkers,
provided that in the future we may be required to raise additional debt or equity funding (including in order to repay such convertible
notes), which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. 

The Final Judgment
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise funding and create additional liability for us.   

Pursuant to the Final
Judgment, described above under   Legal Proceedings  , we agreed to a permanent enjoinment from violating the
Securities Act in future, which once accepted by the court, will cause us to be deemed to be a  bad actor  under Rule
506 of the Securities Act and disqualified by the requirements of Rule 262 of Regulation A, which will prevent us from relying
on an exemption from registration for the sale and issuance of securities under Regulation D and A, respectively. This could make
it harder for us to sell shares privately and negatively affect our ability to raise capital. Additionally, for the three years
following the court s acceptance of the Final Judgment, we will be unable to avail ourselves of the statutory safe harbor
for forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As a result, we may face additional
liability for our forward-looking statements. Both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows,
and could cause the value of our securities to decline in value. 

17  

Additionally, we were
required to pay $500,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the terms of the Final Judgment on October 4, 2016,
which amount has not been paid and which funds we do not currently have. In the event the Securities and Exchange Commission takes
action against us to enforce the payment of the $500,000 owed, it may force us to seek bankruptcy protection. 

We may cease filing
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   

We may not have sufficient
available funding moving forward to continue to prepare and file our periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and may be forced to cease such filings, either temporarily or permanently. In the event that we cease filing reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our common stock would likely be quoted on the pinksheets and would likely have less
liquidity on such market and may trade at a lower share price than on the OTCQB market. Additionally, if we cease our filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors may have less information regarding our operations, financial condition and future
plans, and as such the value of our securities may be adversely effected. If we fail to officially terminate our filing obligations
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission may, in the future, terminate the registration
of our common stock, and prevent trading/quotation of our common stock on any market. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds.  

In August 2016, JMJ converted
$190,628 of principal and interest owed on the JMJ Convertible Note into 24,670,000 shares of common stock. 

In September 2016, JMJ
converted $68,962 of principal and interest owed on the JMJ Convertible Note into 24,395,000 shares of common stock. 

In September 2016, JSJ
converted $38,320 of principal and interest owed on the JSJ Convertible Note into 24,733,056 shares of common stock. 

In September 2016, Duck
Duck converted $46,820 of principal and interest owed on the March 8, 2016 Convertible Promissory Note due to Duck Duck into 26,296,581
shares of common stock. 

We claim an exemption
from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, as the securities above were exchanged by us with our existing
security holders in a transaction where no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting
such exchange. 

As described above under
  Part I - Financial Information       Item 1. Financial Statements.       Note
10. Subsequent Events  , on November 23, 2016, we sold Vis Vires the December, 2016 Vis Vires Note, on November 23, 2016,
we sold the 10% Note Investor the 10% Investor Note, on November 28, 2016, we borrowed an additional $8,500 from JMJ
under the JMJ Convertible Note and on December 5, 2016, we sold JSJ the December 2016 JSJ Convertible Note. The notes are convertible
into our common stock at a discount to the trading price of our common stock as described in greater detail above. We claim an
exemption from registration for the offers, issuances and sales of such convertible notes pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule
506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, since the foregoing issuances did not involve a public offering, the recipients were
(i)   accredited investors   and/or (ii) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required
in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act, and the recipients acquired the securities for investment only and not with
a view towards, or for resale in connection with, the public sale or distribution thereof. The securities were offered without
any general solicitation by us or our representatives. No underwriters or agents were involved in the foregoing issuances and
we paid no underwriting discounts or commissions. The securities sold are subject to transfer restrictions, and the certificates
evidencing the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The securities were not registered
under the Securities Act and such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.

 fact required   to   be
  stated therein  or  necessary in

  knowledge threatened,  which  challenges
  the   right  of the Company or of
a  Subsidiary  with  respect  to  any
Intellectual Property necessary  to enable it to  conduct   its
  business as  now  operated (and, as presently
contemplated  to  be   operated in

  and  the  officers  of the  Company
 know of no  basis   for   any
such claim.   The   Company   has
 not  executed  a  waiver   with
  respect  to the  statute  of  limitations

   Survival . 
 The  representations
  and   warranties  of the  Company
  and  the  agreements   and
  covenants set   forth   in
  this   Agreement   shall

agrees  to  indemnify   and   hold

 other public  statements   with   respect
 to the  transactions contemplated   hereby;
   provided ,    however ,

 or SEC,  OTCQB  (or other  applicable trading
market)  or  FINRA   filings   with

as is required  by  applicable   law 
 and regulations   (although   the
  Buyer   shall  be  consulted
 by the  Company in connection  with any such press  release
 prior to  its   release   and
shall   be   provided  with a copy  thereof

    Construction   .

  will  be  applied against   any
 party.  

m.               
   Remedies . 
 The  Company acknowledges
 that a  breach  by it  of  its  obligations
hereunder will cause irreparable   harm  to  the
  Buyer  by  vitiating the intent 
 and   purpose  of the  transaction
contemplated   hereby.   Accordingly, 
the  Company acknowledges  that  the remedy at
law  for a  breach  of  its obligations 
 under   this   Agreement
  will   be   inadequate
  and agrees,   in  the  event
 of a  breach  or  threatened   breach
 by the  Company  of the  provisions 
of  this Agreement,  that the  Buyer   shall
 be  entitled,   in addition  to  all
 other  available remedies at   law 
 or   in equity, and in addition  to the  penalties
 assessable  herein,  to an  injunction
 or  injunctions restraining, preventing  or  curing
 any  breach  of  this Agreement 
 and  to  enforce specifically  the  terms
and   provisions hereof,   without the 
 necessity  of showing  economic   loss
and  without  any   bond  or other  security
being   required.   

IN
  WITNESS WHEREOF, 
 the  undersigned
  Buyer and  the  Company   have
  caused   this   Agreement
 to  be duly   executed as  of  the
date   first   above  written.

The
  following terms shall
apply   to   this
  Note:  

ARTICLE
  I.  CONVERSION
 RIGHTS  

1.1 
    Conversion Right .
  The   Holder
 shall   have  the right  from
 time  to   time,  and  at
  any  time  during the  period  beginning
 on  the   date   which
  is one hundred eighty   (180)  days
 following the  date  of this   Note
  and   ending  on  the
 later  of: (i)   the Maturity  Date
 and   (ii) the  date  of
payment of the Default  Amount  (as defined   in
  Article  III)  pursuant   to
  Section  1.6(a)  or   Article
 III,  each in  respect  of the  remaining
outstanding  principal  (and accrued interest) amount  of
 this Note  to  convert  all   or
  any  part  of  the  outstanding
and unpaid   principal  amount  of 
this  Note  into  fully   paid
and   non-   assessable shares of Common 
Stock,  as   such   Common
 Stock  exists  on  the   Issue
 Date,  or   any   shares
of capital  stock or other  securities  of  the
 Borrower into  which   such   Common
 Stock  shall   hereafter   be
 changed or  reclassified   at   the
conversion  price  (the    Conversion
 Price )  determined  as  provided
herein  (a   Conversion );  provided ,  however ,  that
 in  no  event shall the  Holder  be
 entitled  to   convert   any
 portion  of  this  Note   in
  excess  of that portion  of this 
 Note   upon   conversion
 of  which the sum  of (1)  the number of
shares  of  Common   Stock   beneficially
 owned  by   the  Holder  and
its  affiliates (other  than shares  of  Common
 Stock  which   may be   deemed
beneficially owned  through  the ownership  of  the
 unconverted  portion of   the   Notes
 or  the unexercised   or   unconverted
portion  of  any  other  security of the
 Borrower  subject  to a  limitation 
 on   conversion   or
  exercise  analogous  to   the
limitations  contained  herein)   and 
(2)  the   number of shares of Common  Stock
 issuable  upon  the conversion   of
  the portion of this  Note  with 
respect  to   which   the
determination  of  this  proviso  is being
  made,   would  result  in
 beneficial  ownership   by   the
 Holder  and its  affiliates of more  than
9.99% of the  outstanding  shares  of  Common
  Stock.   For   purposes
of the  proviso  to   the   immediately
preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall   be  determined  in
  accordance  with  Section  13(d)
 of the Securities  Exchange  Act   of
 1934, as  amended  (the   Exchange
Act ), and  Regulations  13D-G  thereunder, except as  otherwise
 provided  in  clause (1) of such  proviso,
 provided ,    further ,    however ,
 that  the limitations  on  conversion 
 may be   waived   by
 the Holder upon,  at   the election 
of  the  Holder, not  less  than  61
  days   prior  notice   to
  the  Borrower,  and   the
provisions of the conversion limitation shall   continue   

to
  apply   until
such 61st  day   (or   such
 later date,  as determined   by  the
Holder, as  may   be  specified  in
  such notice of   waiver). The   number
of shares of Common  Stock  to   be issued
 upon each  conversion  of  this 
 Note   shall   be
 determined  by   dividing the Conversion
 Amount  (as  defined  below)   by
  the applicable Conversion Price then   in
 effect on  the  date  specified in 
 the notice  of  conversion,   in
  the   form  attached hereto  as
Exhibit  A (the   Notice  of Conversion ),  delivered
  to   the  Borrower  by
  the  Holder  in   accordance
 with  Section  1.4  below;  provided
that  the Notice   of   Conversion
  is  submitted  by   facsimile
  or   e-mail   (or
  by  other  means  resulting  in,
  or   reasonably  expected  to
  result   in,   notice)
  to   the  Borrower before 6:00  p.m.,
New  York,  New  York  time   on
  such conversion   date   (the
 Conversion  Date ).  The  term   Conversion
Amount  means,  with respect  to   any
  conversion  of  this   Note,
  the   sum   of
 (1)  the principal  amount  of this 
 Note to   be  converted  in
 such  conversion   plus  (2)  at 
 the Holder s  option,  accrued and unpaid
 interest,  if   any,  on  such
  principal  amount  at   the
interest rates   provided   in   this
  Note to   the Conversion   Date,
   plus    

  (3)
 at the Holder s  option,  Default 
Interest,  if  any, on  the amounts referred 
 to   in  the immediately  preceding
clauses  (1) and/or (2)   plus   (4)  at
  the Holder s  option,  any 
amounts owed  to   the  Holder  pursuant
 to  Section  1.4(g)  hereof.   

(a)  
  Calculation    of  Conversion 
 Price   . The   conversion
 price (the   Conversion  Price )  shall
  equal  the greater  of   (a)
 $0.00009 per  share;   and  (b) the
Variable  Conversion Price (as defined herein)  (subject to  equitable
 adjustments  for stock splits,  stock  dividends
  or   rights offerings   by
  the  Borrower  relating   to
  the Borrower s securities   or   the
securities of any subsidiary  of  the  Borrower,  combinations,
 recapitalization, reclassifications,  extraordinary  distributions and similar
events).  The    Variable  Conversion
Price   shall  mean  65%   multiplied
by   the  Market  Price  (as  defined
herein)   (representing  a discount rate  of
 35%).  Market  Price  means the   average
 of  the  lowest  five  (5)  Trading
 Prices  (as  defined  below)   for
  the Common  Stock during the  ten 
(10)  Trading Day  period  ending  on  the
latest complete Trading   Day  prior  to 
the  Conversion  Date.   Trading Price 
means, for  any  security  as  of any 
date,  the   closing   bid
 price on  the OTCQB   market,  Pink
Sheets  electronic quotation  system  or 
 applicable trading market (the  OTC ) as  reported by a reliable  reporting
service  ( Reporting Service ) designated  by  the  Holder
 (i.e. Bloomberg) or,  if  the  OTC is 
not  the principal  trading market  for such security,
the closing   bid   price  of  such
security  on  the principal securities exchange  or  trading
 market  where   such security is listed 
 or  traded or,  if  no  closing
  bid  price  of   such
 security  is  available  in   any
  of  the  foregoing  manners,  the
 average of  the closing  bid prices of  any
 market  makers   for  such  security
 that are  listed  in  the  pink 
sheets .  If   the Trading Price  cannot
be  calculated for  such  security  on  such
 date in the  manner  provided above,  the
Trading  Price  shall   be  the  fair
 market  value  as  mutually  determined
 by  the Borrower  and   the
holders  of a  majority  in  interest of
 the Notes  being  converted  for 
 which  the  calculation  of  the
Trading  Price  is  required in order  to
  determine   the Conversion  Price
 of such  Notes.   Trading Day  shall
  mean any   day  on  which
  the Common  Stock is tradable  for any
 period on  the  OTC,  or  on  the
principal  securities  exchange  or other  securities
 market on  which   the Common  Stock
is  then   being traded.   

(b)  
  Conversion    Price  During Major 
 Announcements   .  Notwithstanding  anything
 contained  in   Section  1.2(a)  to
  the  contrary,  in   the
 event  the  Borrower  (i)   makes
 a public announcement that  it intends   to
  consolidate   or   merge
  with   any  other  corporation
 (other  than  a  merger   in
  which the  Borrower  is   the
surviving  or  continuing corporation and   its
  capital  stock  is unchanged)   or
  sell   or   transfer
 all  or  substantially  all   of
  the  assets of  the  Borrower  or
  (ii)   any  person, group  or
  entity  (including  the  Borrower)
 publicly  announces a tender offer  to   purchase
 50%  or   more  of  the
 Borrower s  Common  Stock (or  any
 other takeover scheme) (the date of  the  announcement  referred
  to   in   clause
 (i)  or   (ii)   is
hereinafter referred   to   as the    Announcement
 Date ),  then  the  Conversion 
Price  shall,  effective upon  the Announcement
 Date  and  continuing through  the Adjusted
 Conversion  Price  Termination Date  (as
 defined below),  be   equal   to
  the lower  of  (x) the Conversion 
Price  which would   have   been
applicable for  a Conversion occurring on the  Announcement  Date  and
 (y)  the Conversion  Price that  would
otherwise be   in  effect.  From   and
 after  the  Adjusted  Conversion Price
 Termination Date,  the Conversion Price shall   be
  determined  as set  forth in  this
 Section  1.2(a). For purposes  hereof, 
  Adjusted   Conversion   Price
 Termination  Date  shall  mean, with respect  to
  any  proposed  transaction   or
 tender  offer   (or  takeover  scheme)
for   which  a public announcement  as 
contemplated  by   this Section  1.2(b) has
 been   made, the date   upon
which   the  Borrower  (in   the
 case  of  clause  (i) above)   or
  the person,  group  or   entity
  (in the  case  of  clause  (ii)
 above) consummates  or   publicly  announces
 the   termination   or
  abandonment of the  proposed  transaction
  or  tender  offer   (or
 takeover scheme)  which  caused  this 
 Section  1.2(b) to become  operative.   

1.3 
    Authorized Shares .
  The   Borrower
 covenants  that  during   the
 period  the conversion  right  exists,
the Borrower   will  reserve  from its 
 authorized and unissued  Common Stock a  sufficient
number  of shares,  free   from  preemptive
rights,  to   provide   for
the issuance   of   Common  Stock  upon
  the   full   conversion
of this   Note   issued  pursuant  to
  the Purchase  Agreement.  The  Borrower
 is  required  at   all
  times   to   have
 authorized  and reserved eight times the number  of  shares
 that  is   actually issuable  upon
 full   conversion of the Note   (based
 on  the Conversion   Price   of
the  Notes  in  effect  from  time
 to   time)(the  Reserved   Amount ).
  The   Reserved  Amount  shall
  be   increased   from
 time  to   time   in
 accordance  with   the  Borrower s
 obligations hereunder.  The Borrower  represents
 that  upon   issuance, such shares 
 will   be   duly
  and validly issued,   fully   paid
  and   non-assessable.  In  addition,
if the  Borrower  shall   issue any securities
  or   make   any
change   to   its   capital
 structure  which   would change the 
number  of shares  of  Common  Stock into
 which   the  Notes  shall
  be  convertible  at   the
  then  current  Conversion Price, the 
Borrower  shall   at   the
 same  time   make  proper  provision
 so that thereafter there  shall be  a sufficient  number
of shares   of   Common  Stock  authorized
and  reserved,  free   from preemptive 
rights,  for conversion  of  the   outstanding
 Notes.  The  Borrower  (i)   acknowledges
 that  it   has   irrevocably
 instructed  its  transfer  agent 
to  issue  certificates  for the Common 
Stock  issuable  upon  conversion of this 
Note,  and   

  (ii) 
  agrees   that
 its   issuance  of  this
  Note   shall  constitute  full
  authority   to   its
  officers and  agents  who  are  charged
  with  the  duty  of executing stock
 certificates   to   execute
  and   issue the  necessary  certificates
for shares  of Common Stock  in  accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Note.  

If,
  at   any
  time  the
 Borrower  does  not  maintain   the
Reserved  Amount  it   will   be
  considered   an  Event  of
Default under Section  3.2  of the  Note. ,  provided
 that  the Borrower   shall have  10
 Business   Days   to
  begin   to   cure
  the   default (during which  time,
 if an   authorized share   increase
is   required, the Borrower   will 
 at   the   minimum
  file   the   necessary
  paperwork   with   the
  SEC   to   start
  the   process   to
  increase   its   authorized
 shares,  and   which   if
  timely  completed,  will   not
  constitute   an   Event
of   Default),   provided  that  such
  default does   not   occur
  after   the one   hundred
eighty day   from   the   date
  of the   note, whereupon   there
  would   be  no  cure
  allowed.   

1.4     Method
                                          of   Conversion   .     

(a)  
  Mechanics     of   Conversion   .
 Subject  to   Section  1.1,  this
 Note  may   be  converted  by
  the  Holder  in   whole
  or   in  part  at
  any   time   from
 time to  time  after  the Issue 
Date, by  

  (A)  
  submitting   to
  the   Borrower
a  Notice  of  Conversion  (by  facsimile,
  e-mail   or  other reasonable  means
of communication  dispatched on  the Conversion  Date  prior
 to 6:00  p.m.,   New York, New  York
 time)   and  (B) subject  to
  Section  1.4(b),  surrendering this 
 Note   at the principal  office  of
  the  Borrower.  

(b)  
  Surrender     of   Note
  Upon Conversion   .   Notwithstanding
 anything  to   the contrary  set  forth
herein,  upon  conversion of this  Note  in
  accordance  with  the  terms  hereof,
  the   Holder shall  not  be
  required   to   physically
 surrender  this   Note to   the
 Borrower  unless the   entire   unpaid
principal  amount of this  Note   is 
so converted.  The  Holder  and  the Borrower
shall  maintain  records  showing   the
principal  amount so converted  and   the
 dates  of such  conversions or  shall 
use  such  other  method, reasonably satisfactory
  to   the Holder and the  Borrower,
 so as  not to  require physical  surrender
 of this  Note  upon each   such
 conversion.  In the  event  of   any
 dispute  or   discrepancy, such  records
 of the  Borrower shall,   prima   
facie,   be   controlling and  determinative
in  the absence  of  manifest  error.  Notwithstanding
the   foregoing,   if any  portion  of
 this  Note  is converted  as aforesaid,
the Holder   may  not  transfer this 
Note  unless   the Holder first  physically
 surrenders this   Note to   the
 Borrower,  whereupon the  Borrower  will
  forthwith issue and  deliver upon  the
 order  of the   Holder  a  new
  Note   of   like
 tenor,  registered as the Holder  (upon  payment
 by  the Holder  of  any  applicable
transfer  taxes)   may  request,  representing
  in   the  aggregate  the
remaining unpaid  principal amount  of this  Note.  The
 Holder  and   any  assignee,  by
  acceptance  of  this   Note,
  acknowledge and agree  that,  by 
 reason of the provisions  of  this  paragraph,
 following conversion of  a portion  of 
this  Note,   the unpaid and  unconverted
 principal  amount  of this  Note  represented
  by   this   Note
 may  be   less   than
the  amount  stated  on the  face 
 hereof.   

(c)  
  Payment     of   Taxes
and Fees   .   The  Borrower  shall
 not  be   required   to
  pay   any   tax
  which may   be payable   in
 respect  of   any  transfer  involved
in   the issue and  delivery of  shares 
of  Common  Stock  or  other  securities
  or   property   on
  conversion of this   Note   in
 a  name  other  than  that  of
the  Holder  (or   in  street  name),
and the  Borrower  shall  not  be 
required to  issue   or  deliver  any
  such shares   or  other  securities
  or   property  unless  and
until the person   or   persons  (other
 than the  Holder  or   the
 custodian  in  whose  street name such shares
 are to  be held   for the  Holder s  

account)
 requesting the issuance  thereof  shall 
have  paid   to   the
 Borrower  the  amount  of any  such
 tax  or  shall   have
 established  to   the satisfaction of 
 the  Borrower that  such   tax
  has been   paid. The Holder shall however
pay all costs charged by the Borrower s Transfer Agent in connection with the conversion of this Note or the issuance of
Common Stock in connection herewith.   

(d)  
  Delivery     of   Common
  Stock   Upon Conversion   .
  Upon receipt   by   the
 Borrower  from   the  Holder  of
 a  facsimile  transmission  or   e-mail
  (or  other  reasonable means  of
 communication)  of a  Notice  of  Conversion
 meeting  the requirements for  conversion as provided  in
  this Section  1.4,  the  Borrower
 shall   issue and  deliver  or
  cause   to   be
issued   and delivered   to  or upon  the
 order  of the  Holder certificates  for
the Common  Stock  issuable  upon such conversion  within
 three (3)  business days  after  such 
receipt (the   Deadline ) (and, solely  in  the
  case  of  conversion  of  the
entire unpaid principal  amount  hereof, surrender of this  Note)  in
 accordance  with   the terms   hereof
  and the Purchase   Agreement.   

(e)  
  Obligation     of  Borrower  to
  Deliver   Common   Stock   .
Upon  receipt by  the  Borrower  of 
a  Notice  of  Conversion, the  Holder  shall
be   deemed   to   be
  the holder  of record of  the Common 
Stock  issuable  upon  such  conversion,
 the outstanding principal  amount  and 
 the  amount  of accrued and unpaid interest 
on  this   Note   shall
  be  reduced  to   reflect
  such  conversion,  and,  unless
 the  Borrower  defaults  on  its
 obligations under  this   Article 
 I,   all  rights with respect to  the
portion  of  this   Note   being
 so converted  shall forthwith  terminate except  the
right   to   receive the Common  Stock
 or  other  securities,  cash  or
 other  assets,  as herein  provided, 
on such  conversion.   If   the
 Holder  shall   have   given
 a  Notice  of  Conversion as provided herein,
  the  Borrower s  obligation 
 to   issue   and
 deliver  the  certificates  for Common
 Stock  shall   be  absolute  and
unconditional,  irrespective of  the absence  of  any
  action   by  the Holder  to
  enforce the  same,  any  waiver  or
  consent   with  respect  to
  any  provision thereof,  the  recovery
of  any  judgment against  any  person  or
  any   action   to
  enforce the same, any failure   or 
 delay in   the  enforcement of  any
 other  obligation  of  the  Borrower
 to   the holder  of record, or  any
 setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,  limitation   or
 termination,  or   any   breach
  or   alleged   breach
  by   the  Holder  of
  any   obligation   to
  the Borrower,   and   irrespective
of any  other  circumstance which might   otherwise
  limit such obligation of the  Borrower to  the
 Holder  in   connection  with  such
 conversion. The  Conversion  Date  specified
  in   the Notice  of  Conversion
shall   be   the Conversion  Date so
 long   as   the
  Notice  of  Conversion   is
 received  by   the  Borrower  before
 6:00  p.m., New  York,  New York time,
 on  such  date.  

(f)   
  Delivery    of  Common   Stock
  by  Electronic  Transfer   .
 In  lieu   of   delivering
physical  certificates  representing  the  Common
 Stock  issuable  upon conversion,  provided
the  Borrower  is  participating  in 
the  Depository   Trust Company   ( DTC )
 Fast  Automated Securities  Transfer  ( FAST )
 program, upon request  of the Holder and   its
  compliance  with  the provisions contained
  in   Section  1.1  and
  in  this  Section  1.4,  the
 Borrower  shall  use  its   best
 efforts  to   cause   its
 transfer  agent  to  electronically 
transmit  the Common   Stock   issuable
 upon  conversion  to  the Holder 
 by   crediting the  account  of
Holder s Prime  Broker with  DTC  through  its
 Deposit  Withdrawal Agent Commission   ( DWAC )
  system.   

(g)  
  Failure     to   Deliver
  Common   Stock   Prior
  to   Deadline   .
 Without  in   any   way
  limiting the Holder s  right to  pursue
other remedies, including actual  damages  and/or   equitable
 relief,  the parties agree  that if delivery  of
 the  Common  Stock  issuable  upon
conversion  of this   Note   is
 not  delivered by  the  Deadline, unless
such failure is the result of the actions or inactions of the Holder,  the Borrower  shall
 pay  to   the  Holder $2,000 per  day
  in   cash, for   each
  day beyond the Deadline  that  the 
Borrower  fails   to   deliver
  such Common  Stock.  Such  cash amount
 shall be   paid   to
  Holder by   the   fifth
  day of the month following the   month 
in  which   it   has
  accrued  or,  at the option of the 
Holder  (by  written  notice   to
  the  Borrower  by   the
first   day  of  the   month
  following the month   in   which
  it   has  accrued),  shall
be   added   to   the
 principal amount  of   this  Note,
 in   which  event  interest
  shall   accrue  thereon  in
  accordance  with  the terms  of  this
 Note  and   such additional principal 
amount  shall   be convertible  into  Common
 Stock  in   accordance   with
  the  terms  of this  Note.  The
 Borrower  agrees  that  the right 
to convert  is  a  valuable  right  to
  the  Holder.  The   damages
 resulting  from  a failure, attempt  to 
 frustrate, interference   with   such
conversion  right are difficult if not  impossible   to
  qualify.   Accordingly  the  parties
acknowledge  that  the liquidated damages provision contained   in
  this Section  1.4(g) are  justified.   

1.5 
    Concerning the   
 Shares   .
The   shares of Common
  Stock  issuable
  upon   conversion  of this  Note
  may  not  be   sold
  or   transferred unless  (i)  such
shares  are  sold  pursuant  to   an
 effective registration statement  under  the  Act
  or   (ii)   the
 Borrower  or   its  transfer agent shall
 have   been   furnished
 with  an  opinion  of counsel  (which
opinion  shall be   in   form,
substance   and  scope  customary for opinions
 of counsel  in   comparable  transactions)
 to   the  effect that  the
 shares  to   be sold   or
  transferred   may   be
sold   or  transferred pursuant  to 
 an   exemption from  such  registration
  or   (iii)   such
shares  are  sold   or  transferred
 pursuant  to  Rule  144  under
the Act  (or a successor  rule) ( Rule  144 )  or
  (iv)   such shares  are  transferred
  to   an    affiliate 
 (as defined in  Rule  144)  of the 
Borrower  who agrees   to   sell
  or   otherwise  transfer  the
shares  only  in  accordance  with 
this  Section  1.5  and  who  is
  an   Accredited  Investor  (as
defined   in  the Purchase  Agreement). 
Except  as otherwise  provided  in   the
 Purchase  Agreement   (and  subject
 to   the   removal
 provisions set  forth   below),   until
such  time as  the shares  of  Common 
Stock  issuable  upon conversion  of   this
 Note  have   been  registered  under
the Act   or   otherwise   may
  be   sold  pursuant  to
  Rule  144 without  any  restriction
 as   to   the
number  of securities as of a particular date that  can   then
  be  immediately  sold, each  certificate
 for   shares   of
Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion
of this  Note that  has  not  been 
so  included   in   an
 effective registration statement  or  that  has
 not  been   sold  pursuant  to
  an  effective  registration  statement
or  an  exemption that  permits   removal
 of  the legend,   shall   bear
 a  legend   substantially   in
  the following form, as appropriate:   

NEITHER
THE     ISSUANCE  AND
  SALE   OF  THE  SECURITIES
REPRESENTED  BY THIS  CERTIFICATE NOR  THE  SECURITIES
  INTO  WHICH  THESE SECURITIES ARE 
 EXERCISABLE  HAVE  BEEN   REGISTERED
UNDER  THE  SECURITIES   ACT OF  1933,
AS  AMENDED,  OR  APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES
 LAWS.  THE   SECURITIES   MAY
 NOT  BE OFFERED   FOR  SALE, SOLD,
 TRANSFERRED  OR  ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE
  OF  (A) AN  EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION
 STATEMENT   FOR  THE   

SECURITIES
 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT   OF  1933, AS  AMENDED,
 OR  (B)   AN OPINION   OF
  COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED   BY
 THE  HOLDER), IN  A  GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE
FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS   NOT REQUIRED UNDER  SAID  ACT
OR   (II) UNLESS  SOLD  PURSUANT  TO
RULE  144  OR RULE  144A UNDER  SAID ACT.
 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES   MAY
  BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH  A  BONA
  FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT  OR  OTHER 
 LOAN OR   FINANCING ARRANGEMENT  SECURED
BY  THE SECURITIES.     

The
legend   set   forth
  above shall be 
 removed  and 
 the  Borrower  shall  issue  to
  the   Holder  a  new
 certificate therefore  free  of  any 
transfer  legend   if  (i)  the
 Borrower  or   its  transfer  agent
shall   have  received  an  opinion
 of  counsel, in  form, substance and  scope
 customary for opinions  of  counsel  in
 comparable  transactions, to  the effect 
that a  public  sale  or   transfer
of  such  Common  Stock may  be made 
without  registration under the  Act,  which 
 opinion shall   be  accepted  by
 the Borrower so that  the  sale  or 
transfer  is  effected or  (ii) in   the
 case of  the Common   Stock   issuable
 upon  conversion of this  Note, such  security
  is  registered  for  sale by  the
 Holder under  an effective  registration statement  filed
 under the Act or  otherwise   may 
 be  sold pursuant  to   Rule
 144 without any restriction  as   to 
 the number of securities as  of a  particular
 date that  can then   be   immediately
sold. In the  event that  the  Borrower does not accept  the
opinion of  counsel  provided   by 
 the Holder   with  respect  to
  the  transfer  of Securities pursuant
 to  an   exemption from registration, such
 as Rule 144  or Regulation  S,  at 
 the   Deadline, it   will
  be considered an  Event of  Default 
pursuant to  Section  3.2  of the   Note.   

1.6     Effect
                                             of
                                             Certain
                                         Events   .    

(a)  
  Effect     of  Merger,  Consolidation,
  Etc   .   At
the  option  of the Holder,   the   sale,
conveyance   or   disposition   of
 all  or   substantially all  of  the
assets of the  Borrower,  the effectuation   by
  the  Borrower  of  a  transaction
  or  series  of  related  transactions
 in  which more   than  50%  of
the voting  power  of the  Borrower  is 
disposed  of,   or   the
 consolidation,  merger   or  other  business
 combination of the Borrower  with   or 
into  any  other  Person (as  defined  below)
  or   Persons when the  Borrower  is
 not  the survivor shall  either:  (i) be
deemed   to   be   an
 Event of  Default  (as defined  in 
 Article  III)  pursuant   to
 which the Borrower  shall   be required 
 to   pay   to
  the   Holder  upon  the
consummation of and as  a condition  to  such  transaction
  an  amount  equal   to
  the Default  Amount  (as  defined

  any  time  when   this
  Note   is issued   and
outstanding and  prior  to   conversion 
of all  of the  Notes, there  shall   be
  any  merger,  consolidation, exchange 
of  shares,  recapitalization,  reorganization,
  or  other  similar  event,  as
 a  result of   which   shares
of Common  Stock  of the  Borrower shall  be
 changed into  the   same   or
 a  different number  of  shares 
of another  class   or   classes
 of stock or  securities  of  the   

Borrower
 or   another entity,   or
  in  case  of any sale  or  conveyance
 of  all   or   substantially
 all of  the   assets  of  the
 Borrower other  than   in  connection
with a plan of complete  liquidation  of  the 
Borrower,  then   the  Holder of  this
  Note   shall  thereafter  have
  the  right  to   receive
 upon conversion  of this  Note,  upon   the
basis and  upon  the terms  and  conditions
specified   herein   and   in
  lieu   of   the
  shares  of Common Stock  immediately 
theretofore  issuable  upon conversion, such stock,  securities
  or   assets which the  Holder  would
  have been  entitled  to   receive
  in  such  transaction   had
  this   Note   been
 converted  in   full   immediately
 prior  to   such   transaction
 (without regard to  any limitations  on  conversion
 set  forth   herein), and  in  any
  such  case appropriate  provisions shall
be   made  with respect  to   the
 rights  and  interests of  the Holder 
of  this   Note to   the
end  that  the provisions hereof (including,  without  limitation,
provisions for adjustment of the  Conversion  Price   and
 of  the number of shares issuable   upon
  conversion of the  Note)  shall 
thereafter  be applicable, as   nearly  as
 may   be   practicable
  in  relation  to   any
 securities or  assets  thereafter  deliverable
 upon  the  conversion  hereof.  The
Borrower  shall  not  affect   any
 transaction described  in  this  Section
 1.6(b) unless (a)  it  first  gives, 
to  the  extent practicable,  thirty  (30)
days  prior   written notice  (but  in
  any  event  at   least
  fifteen   (15)   days
 prior written  notice)  of  the 
 record  date  of the   special
  meeting of  shareholders  to   approve,
 or  if  there  is  no  such
 record  date,   the   consummation
of,  such merger, consolidation,  exchange of shares,  recapitalization,  reorganization
  or  other similar event  or   sale
 of assets (during  which  time  the 
Holder  shall   be   entitled
 to convert  this   Note)   and
 (b)  the  resulting successor  or 
 acquiring  entity  (if  not  the
 Borrower)  assumes   by  written instrument
 the  obligations of  this  Section 1.6(b).
The  above   provisions shall similarly apply 
 to   successive   consolidations,
mergers, sales, transfers   or   share exchanges.   

(c)  
  Adjustment Due     to   Distribution   .
  If the  Borrower  shall   declare
  or   make   any
 distribution of  its  assets  (or 
 rights   to   acquire
  its  assets)  to   holders
 of  Common  Stock  as  a  dividend,
 stock  repurchase,   by   way
  of  return  of capital   or
  otherwise  (including  any  dividend
or  distribution   to   the
Borrower s shareholders   in  cash  or
  shares  (or  rights  to  acquire
 shares) of  capital  stock  of  a
subsidiary (i.e., a  spin-off))  (a   Distribution ),
  then  the Holder  of  this Note  shall
be  entitled, upon  any   conversion of this
 Note  after the date of  record  for 
 determining shareholders entitled   to   such
  Distribution,   to   receive
  the  amount  of such  assets  which
  would  have  been   payable
  to   the Holder   with
 respect  to   the shares of   Common
 Stock  issuable  upon such  conversion 
 had   such  Holder  been
  the holder of such shares  of  Common
 Stock on  the  record  date   for
the determination of shareholders  entitled  to   such
  Distribution.   

(d)  
  Adjustment Due     to   Dilutive
  Issuance   .  If,  at
  any   time  when  any
  Notes  are  issued   and
 outstanding,  the  Borrower  issues 
 or   sells,   or
  in   accordance  with  this
Section  1.6(d)  hereof   is  deemed
 to   have   issued
  or   sold, any   shares
of Common   Stock   for  no  consideration
  or   for  a  consideration
 per  share  (before deduction  of reasonable
 expenses  or   commissions   or
  underwriting  discounts or  allowances
  in  connection  therewith)   or
  for   consideration  per  share
which   is  less than the Conversion Price  in
 effect on  the  date  of such issuance
  (or  deemed  issuance) of such shares of
Common  Stock  (a    Dilutive 
 Issuance ),   then   immediately
 upon  the   Dilutive  Issuance,  the
Conversion  Price will  be   reduced 
 to   the  amount  of
the  consideration  per   

share
received   by   the
  Borrower  in
 such  Dilutive Issuance. Provided  that no  adjustment
  shall   be   required
 or  made   in   connection
  with   the   issuance
  of   shares   of
  Common  Stock or  securities  (a)
 upon conversion  and/or  exercise   of
the Borrower s   currently   outstanding
  convertible  promissory  notes, 
 convertible   securities, warrants   and
options;   (b)   to   officers,
employees,   directors  or  consultants 
 in   connection with issuances   pursuant
  to  a  stock   plan
  approved   by   the
Board  of  Directors of the Borrower;  or (c)  to
  persons   or   entities
 with  whom   the  Borrower  is
in   discussions   regarding an   investment
  in   the Borrower as of the date 
 of   the   Borrower s
entry   into   this  Note  (or
  in   connection   with
  the   issuance   or
  grant of any   securities   of
the Borrower  to  such   entities), regardless
  in   each  case  of
the   conversion   price  or  deemed
issuance   price of   such   shares
and   securities.   

The
  Borrower  shall
  be  deemed  to   have
  issued   or   sold
shares  of Common Stock  if   the  Borrower
 in   any  manner  issues
  or   grants   any
 warrants,  rights  or  options  (not
 including  employee stock  option  plans),
 whether   or  not  immediately
 exercisable,  to   subscribe   for
  or to   purchase Common  Stock  or
 other  securities convertible  into  or
  exchangeable for  Common Stock  ( Convertible
  Securities ) (such  warrants,  rights
  and   options   to
  purchase   Common   Stock
or   Convertible  Securities are hereinafter  referred
  to   as    Options )
  and the price  per  share for which Common
 Stock  is   issuable  upon  the
 exercise of  such  Options  is   less
  than  the Conversion  Price   then
  in  effect,  then   the
Conversion Price   shall be   equal 
 to   such   price
 per  share. For  purposes  of the preceding
 sentence,  the  price  per  share
for   which   Common  Stock  is
 issuable upon  the exercise  of such  Options 
is  determined  by  dividing  (i) 
the total amount,  if   any,   received
  or   receivable   by
  the  Borrower  as consideration for the
  issuance   or   granting
of  all such  Options, plus the   minimum
 aggregate amount  of additional  consideration, if any,  payable
  to the  Borrower  upon   the
exercise of  all  such  Options,  plus,
  in   the  case  of
Convertible  Securities  issuable  upon  the
exercise  of  such  Options,  the 
 minimum  aggregate amount  of  additional
 consideration payable  upon  the conversion 
 or   exchange thereof   at
  the time  such Convertible  Securities
 first  become  convertible  or  exchangeable,
 by   (ii) the maximum  total  number
of shares of  Common Stock  issuable  upon the exercise of  all
 such  Options  (assuming  full   conversion
 of  Convertible  Securities,  if 
applicable).  No   further adjustment   to
  the Conversion  Price will  be   made
 upon  the   actual   issuance
of such Common  Stock  upon   the exercise
of such Options  or upon  the conversion   or
  exchange   of Convertible Securities 
 issuable   upon   exercise
of such Options.   

Additionally,
the   Borrower  shall
  be deemed   to   have
  issued   or   sold
 shares  of Common  Stock  if   the
 Borrower  in   any  manner  issues
  or   sells   any
Convertible  Securities,  whether   or 
not  immediately  convertible (other  than 
 where the  same are  issuable  upon  the
  exercise  of Options),  and the 
price per  share for which Common  Stock  is 
issuable upon  such   conversion   or
  exchange is   less   than
the Conversion  Price  then   in  effect,
 then   the  Conversion  Price
shall be equal   to   such  price per
 share.  For  the  purposes of the  preceding
sentence,  the   price  per share  for
which Common  Stock  is  issuable upon  such
 conversion  or  exchange   is determined
  by  dividing  (i)  the total amount,
 if  any,  received   or
  receivable   by   the
 Borrower  as   consideration for the 
 issuance   or   sale
 of all  such Convertible  Securities, plus  the
 minimum aggregate  amount of additional  consideration,  if
  any, payable   to   the
 Borrower  upon   the   

conversion
  or   exchange
thereof   at   the
time such Convertible Securities first   become
  convertible  or
  exchangeable,   by   (ii)
the maximum  total number  of shares  of  Common
 Stock  issuable   upon   the
conversion   or   exchange of  all  such
Convertible  Securities.  No   further 
adjustment  to   the Conversion Price  will
 be made  upon  the actual issuance of such Common
 Stock upon conversion or  exchange of such Convertible Securities.   

(e)  
  Purchase Rights .  If,  at   any
 time when  any  Notes are  issued 
 and   outstanding, the  Borrower  issues
  any  convertible securities  or 
 rights   to   purchase
 stock,  warrants, securities   or 
other  property  (the   Purchase Rights )
  pro  rata  to   the
 record  holders  of  any  class of
 Common   Stock,   then
 the Holder of this  Note   will   be
 entitled  to   acquire,  upon the terms
 applicable   to  such  Purchase
 Rights,  the  aggregate  Purchase Rights
which such  Holder  could  have  acquired
if  such Holder  had   held  the  number
 of  shares   of   Common
 Stock  acquirable   upon   complete
conversion  of  this   Note   (without
regard   to  any  limitations  on  conversion
 contained  herein) immediately before the  date on  which
 a record is taken  for the  grant, issuance  or
  sale  of  such  Purchase Rights
 or,   if  no  such
 record  is  taken,  the   date
  as  of  which  the record  holders
 of  Common  Stock  are   to
  be   determined for the grant, issue 
 or  sale  of  such  Purchase
Rights.   

(f)   
  Notice    of  Adjustments   .
  Upon the occurrence  of  each   adjustment
 or  readjustment  of  the  Conversion
Price as a result  of the  events  described 
 in  this  Section  1.6,  the
 Borrower,  at   its  expense,  shall
promptly  compute  such  adjustment  or 
 readjustment   and  prepare  and
furnish   to   the Holder  a certificate
 setting forth  such adjustment  or   readjustment
  and  showing  in   detail
 the  facts  upon which such adjustment or  readjustment
  is   based.  The Borrower  shall,
 upon  the  written request  at   any
 time  of   the  Holder,  furnish
  to  such Holder a like certificate  setting
forth (i) such adjustment  or readjustment,  (ii)   the
 Conversion  Price   at   the
time   in   effect   and
 (iii)  the number  of  shares  of
 Common  Stock  and the  amount,  if
 any, of other  securities  or  property
which   at   the time   would
be   received  upon  conversion of the 
Note.  

1.7 
   Trading   
 Market  Limitations     .
  Unless  permitted  by   the
applicable   rules   and   regulations
of the principal securities  market on  which   the
Common  Stock  is then   listed  or
traded,  in  no  event shall the  Borrower
 issue  upon conversion of  or   otherwise
 pursuant  to  this Note  and  the other
 Notes   issued  pursuant to  the
Purchase Agreement more   than   the 
maximum  number of shares of Common  Stock that  the
 Borrower  can issue   pursuant  to
any rule  of   the   principal
United  States  securities  market on  which
  the Common  Stock is  then  traded
 (the    Maximum  Share Amount ),
which  shall   be   9.99%
of the total shares outstanding  on  the  Closing Date  (as
  defined  in  the Purchase  Agreement),
 subject  to  equitable  adjustment from time
 to  time  for  stock  splits,
 stock  dividends,  combinations,  capital
reorganizations and  similar events relating to  the  Common Stock  occurring
 after  the  date  hereof.   Once
  the   Maximum  Share Amount  has
been   issued,  if  the  Borrower  fails
  to   eliminate any prohibitions  under
 applicable  law  or   the
rules   or   regulations of any  stock
 exchange, interdealer quotation system   or 
other  self-regulatory   organization  with
 jurisdiction  over  the  Borrower or  any
 of  its   securities  on  the
 Borrower s ability  to  issue  shares
of Common  Stock in  excess of the Maximum  Share Amount, in  lieu
  of   any   

further
right   to   convert
this   Note,  this
 will  be   considered   an
 Event  of Default  under  Section 
 3.3   of the Note.   

1.8 
   Status  as
  Shareholder   . Upon submission 
of a  Notice of Conversion   by  a  Holder,
(i) the shares covered thereby  (other  than   the
shares,   if   any, which  cannot  be
  issued because  their  issuance would
 exceed  such  Holder s allocated  portion
 of  the Reserved  Amount or  Maximum 
Share Amount)  shall   be  deemed converted
into  shares  of  Common  Stock  and
 (ii)  the   Holder s  rights
 as  a Holder  of such  converted  portion
of this  Note  shall   cease and  terminate,
 excepting   only   the
 right  to   receive certificates for 
such  shares  of  Common  Stock  and
  to   any   remedies
 provided  herein   or   otherwise
available  at  law   or  in equity to
such Holder  because  of a  failure   by
  the  Borrower  to   comply
 with  the  terms  of this   Note.
  Notwithstanding the  foregoing,  if 
a Holder  has  not  received  certificates
 for   all   shares
 of Common Stock  prior   to   the
 tenth  (10th)   business day  after
 the  expiration of  the  Deadline  with
 respect  to  a  conversion  of  any
 portion of  this   Note   for
 any reason,  then   (unless the  Holder
 otherwise  elects  to   retain
its  status  as  a  holder of Common 
Stock by so  notifying   the  Borrower)  the
 Holder  shall  regain  the  rights
of a Holder of  this   Note  with respect
 to  such unconverted  portions  of  this
  Note   and  the Borrower  shall,
 as  soon   as practicable,  return
such unconverted  Note   to   the
Holder  or, if  the  Note  has  not
 been   surrendered,  adjust  its
 records  to   reflect  that such  portion
of  this  Note   has  not been converted.
In  all  cases,  the  Holder  shall
 retain all of  its  rights  and remedies
  for   the  Borrower s  failure
 to convert  this  Note.  

1.9             
   Prepayment . Notwithstanding
  anything  to
  the contrary  contained  in   this
 Note,  at   any  time during  the
periods  set forth on the table  immediately following this   paragraph
 (the  Prepayment Periods ),  the  Borrower shall  have
the  right,  exercisable   on  not  less
 than  three

  to   the Holder of the  Note to  prepay
  the outstanding  Note  (principal and
accrued  interest),  in   full,   in

  notice  of  prepayment hereunder 
(an   Optional  Prepayment  Notice )
shall be delivered  to  the  Holder of the Note  at
  its  registered  addresses and shall 
state:  (1)  that  the  Borrower  is
  exercising   its  right to  prepay
the   Note,   and  (2)  the
 date  of prepayment   which   shall
  be  not  more   than
 three (3) Trading  Days from the   date 
 of  the  Optional  Prepayment  Notice.
On  the date  fixed for prepayment   (the
   Optional  Prepayment Date ),  the
 Borrower  shall   make  payment  of
 the  Optional  Prepayment Amount  (as 
defined  below)  to  Holder,   or
  upon  the order  of  the Holder as
specified  by   the  Holder  in
 writing to  the  Borrower,  at least 
 one  (1)  business day  prior  to
  the Optional  Prepayment Date.  If 
 the  Borrower  exercises its  right  to
  prepay   the  Note,  the
 Borrower  shall   make  payment to
 the   Holder  of  an
 amount  in  cash (the   Optional
 Prepayment Amount )  equal  to  the
 percentage ( Prepayment  Percentage )   as
 set  forth   in  the  table
  immediately following this  paragraph  opposite
the applicable  Prepayment Period,  multiplied by  the  sum
 of: (w)  the  then outstanding  principal
 amount  of this  Note   plus  (x) 
 accrued   and   unpaid
interest  on  the unpaid principal  amount  of
  this   Note to   the
  Optional  Prepayment Date   plus  
 (y) Default  Interest, if any, on  the 
 amounts referred  to  in  clauses (w)  and
 (x)  plus   (z)   any  amounts owed
 to   the  Holder pursuant to  Section
 1.4(g)  hereof.   If  the Borrower
 delivers an Optional   Prepayment  Notice
 and fails  to  pay   the
  Optional  Prepayment  Amount due 
 to   the  Holder  of
the  Note  within  two (2)  business 
days  

following
the Optional   Prepayment Date,  the

its  right  to   prepay   the
 Note  pursuant   to   this

 agent not to  transfer   or   delays,
  impairs,  and/or  hinders its transfer
 agent in transferring  (or   issuing) (electronically

 covenant or other  term   or   condition
contained  in  any of the  Other  Agreements,
after the passage of   all applicable   notice
and  cure or  grace   periods,   shall,
  at   the option of the Holder,   be
 considered a  default  under  this

 Note shall  become immediately due  and  payable
  and the  Borrower shall  pay  to
 the Holder,   in full  satisfaction  of
 its  obligations  hereunder,  an 
amount  equal  to  the  greater  of

 then  outstanding  principal amount of  this
 Note   plus   (x)  accrued and 
unpaid  interest  on  the unpaid  principal
amount  of  this Note to  the  date  of
 payment (the   Mandatory  Prepayment Date )   plus
   (y) Default  Interest,  if  any,
on  the amounts referred  to in  clauses 
(w) and/or  (x)   plus  (z)  any  amounts
owed to  the  Holder  pursuant  to  Section
 1.4(g)  hereof  (the  then   outstanding
principal  amount  of   this  Note to
 the date of payment    plus    the
 amounts  referred  to in clauses (x),  (y)
and  (z)  shall   collectively   be
  known   as   the
 Default Sum )  or  (ii)   the
   parity   value  of the Default
  Sum  to  be   prepaid,
where parity  value  means  (a)  the 
highest  number of shares  of  Common  Stock
 issuable  upon  conversion  of  or
  otherwise  pursuant to such  Default 
 Sum in  accordance  with   Article
 I,  treating the Trading  Day  immediately
 preceding  the Mandatory  Prepayment Date  as
the  Conversion  Date   for  purposes  of
determining the  lowest  applicable Conversion   Price,
  unless  the  Default  Event  arises
 as a result  of  a  breach   in
 respect  of  a  specific Conversion 
Date in which case  such Conversion  Date  shall
 be  the Conversion  Date),   multiplied
   by   (b) the  highest  Closing
  Price for the Common  Stock  during 
 the  period  beginning  on the date  of
 first  occurrence  of  the  Event
 of  Default  and  ending  one
 day prior to  the Mandatory  Prepayment Date  (the
 Default  Amount )  and  all other  amounts
 payable  hereunder shall immediately become due  and payable, all without  demand,
 presentment or  notice,  all of  which
hereby  are expressly waived, together  with  all costs,  including,
 without  limitation,  legal  fees 
 and  expenses,  of collection,   and
  the Holder shall   be   entitled
 to  exercise  all other  rights 
 and   remedies available  at law or in  equity.   

If
  the   Borrower
 fails   to   pay
  the Default  Amount  within   five
 (5)  business days of  written  notice
 that  such  amount  is   due
and  payable,  then   the Holder   shall
  have the right   at   any
  time,   so   long
and   to   the extent  that there are
 sufficient authorized shares,  to  require the
Borrower,   upon   written notice,   to
 convert  the Default  Amount into  shares
 of  Common  Stock  of  the Borrower
 pursuant  to  Section  1.1  hereof.

  it under  this  Agreement and   agrees
 that  such   service shall  constitute
good  and  sufficient  service  of process
 and notice  thereof.  Nothing contained herein
shall   be  deemed  to  limit  in
  any way any  right  to   serve
 process  in   any  other  manner
 permitted  by   law.   

4.7 
   Certain Amounts .
Whenever   pursuant  to
  this  Note  the  Borrower  is
  required   to   pay
  an  amount  in   excess
of the outstanding principal   amount  (or  the
portion thereof  required  to   be  paid
 at  that  time)  plus  accrued
and unpaid  interest  plus   Default 
Interest on such interest,  the  Borrower  and 
 the Holder agree  that  the actual damages 
 to   the Holder   from
  the receipt of   cash   payment
 on  this  Note  may be   difficult
  to   determine and the  amount  to
  be  so  paid   by
  the  Borrower  represents stipulated 
 damages   and  not a  penalty
  and   is intended   to
  compensate the Holder   in  part  for
  loss  of  the opportunity   to
 convert  this   Note   and
  to   earn  a return  from
  the  sale  of shares  of  Common
 Stock  acquired  upon  conversion 
of this  Note   at  a  price
  in   excess  of  the
  price paid for   such   shares
 pursuant  to   this  Note.  The
 Borrower  and   the  Holder  hereby
agree   that   such  amount  of
 stipulated  damages   is  not  plainly
 disproportionate  to  the  possible loss
  to   the Holder   from
  the receipt of  a  cash  payment
 without the opportunity   to  convert  this
  Note   into shares of Common   Stock.   

4.8 
   Purchase Agreement .
  By   its
  acceptance of this 
 Note,  each 
 party agrees   to   be
  bound   by   the
applicable  terms  of the   Purchase 
 Agreement.   

4.9 
   Notice   
 of Corporate  Events     .
 Except  as otherwise provided below, the  Holder  of
  this   Note   shall
  have  no  rights as  a  Holder
of Common  Stock  unless   and   only
  to   the extent  that  it
 converts  this   Note   into
  Common  Stock.  The  Borrower  shall
  provide   the  Holder  with
 prior  notification  of  any meeting of
the  Borrower s  shareholders  (and  copies
 of  proxy materials   and  other  information
 sent  to   shareholders). In the event of
  any  taking  by   the
 Borrower  of  a record  of   its
  shareholders for the  purpose  of determining
shareholders  who are entitled  to   receive
payment of any  dividend  or  other  distribution,
any  right  to   subscribe  for,  purchase
  or   otherwise acquire (including 
 by   way of  merger,  consolidation,
reclassification   or   recapitalization) 
 any  share  of   any
  class   or   any
 other  securities   or   property,
  or to   receive any  other right,
or  for the  purpose of  determining  shareholders
who are  entitled   to   vote
  in  connection with  any  proposed
 sale,   lease   or
  conveyance of  all  or   substantially
 all of  the  assets  of the Borrower 
or  any  proposed liquidation,  dissolution 
 or   winding  up  of
the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  shall 
 mail  a  notice   to
  the Holder, at  least  twenty  (20)
 days  prior  to   the
 record  date   specified   therein
  (or   thirty  (30)  days
 prior  to   the consummation  of  the
  transaction   or   event,
  whichever is  earlier),  of the 
date on  which   any   such
 record  is   to   be
  taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, right  or other event,
 and  a  brief  statement  regarding
the  amount  and  character  of such 
dividend,  distribution,  right or other  event
 to  the extent   known   at
  such   time.   The
  Borrower   shall   make
 a  public  announcement  of   any
  event requiring notification   to 
 the  Holder  hereunder substantially simultaneously
 with  the   notification   to
  the Holder   in   accordance
 with  the terms of  this  Section 4.9.   

4.10         
   Remedies . The
  Borrower  acknowledges
 that a  breach   by   it
 of  its obligations hereunder  will cause  irreparable
harm  to  the Holder,   by   vitiating
 the intent  and  purpose  of  the
 transaction  contemplated  hereby.   Accordingly,
the  Borrower  acknowledges   that 
 the remedy   at  law  for
 a  breach of   its   obligations
 under  this   Note  will  be
  inadequate   and  agrees, in  the
event of  a  breach   or   threatened
breach   by   the  Borrower  of
the provisions of this  Note, that  the Holder shall be  entitled,  in
 addition  to   all  other  available
 remedies at  law   or   in
 equity,  and  in  

addition
  to   the
  penalties assessable  herein,
  to   an   injunction
  or   injunctions  restraining, preventing
or  curing   any breach of this   Note
  and  to  enforce specifically the 
terms  and provisions  thereof, without  the necessity
  of   showing economic  loss  and
 without  any  bond  or  other  security
being required.   

IN
WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Borrower  has   caused
  this   Note  to  be
  signed   in   its
name   by   its   duly
  authorized officer this November  15,  2016.

THIS   NOTE  is  a
duly  authorized Convertible Promissory  Note  of
Jammin  Java  Corp.  a  corporation  duly  organized
and existing under the laws of the State of  Nevada  (the
  Company  ), designated as the Company's 10% Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of  $110,000  (the
  Note  ). This Note will become effective  only  upon execution   by   both
parties   and   delivery of the first
payment of consideration   by  the  Holder
(the   Effective Date  ).   

FOR
VALUE RECEIVED,   the  Company
 hereby  promises to  pay  to the order
 of  Iconic Holdings, LLC   or its   registered
  assigns or successors-in-interest (the   Holder  ) the Principal
 Sum of $110,000  (the    Principal  Sum    )
and to  pay   guaranteed  interest   on
 the principal  balance  hereof  at an amount
equivalent to 10% of the Principal Sum, to the extent such Principal  Sum  and  guaranteed 
interest and   any   other interest, fees,
liquidated damages and/or items due to Holder herein have  been  repaid   or
  converted  into  the Company's Common
Stock (the   Common Stock  ), in accordance with the terms hereof. Upon the execution of this Note the sum of
$24,000 shall be remitted and delivered to   the   Company,
  and $2,400 shall be retained   by 
 the Purchaser through an original issue discount (the   OID  ) for due
diligence and legal bills related to this transaction. The OID is set at  10%  of 
any  consideration paid. The Holder  may  pay 
 additional Consideration to the Company in such amounts and at such dates (  Additional
Consideration   and  each, an    Additional Consideration Date  )
as Holder  may  choose in its   

sole
discretion. The Principal Sum due to Holder shall be prorated based on the   Consideration
  actually paid   by
  Holder   (plus
 the  guaranteed  interest and 10% OID, both which are prorated based on the
Consideration actually paid   by   the Holder,
as well as   any   other interest or fees)
such that the Company is  only  required to  repay  the
amount funded and the  Company  is not required to  repay  any
  unfunded portion of this Note, nor  any  interest
or OID on   any   unfunded portion of this
Note. The Maturity Date is one   year   from
the Effective Date  of  the Initial   Consideration
  payment and each additional payment of Additional Consideration, if any, as applicable
  (the   Maturity Date  )   and
is the date upon which the Principal Sum of this   Note,   as
well as   any   unpaid interest and other fees,
shall be  due  and payable.   

In
  addition to the  guaranteed 
interest referenced above, and   in
  the Event of Default
pursuant to Section 2.00(a), additional interest   will
 accrue from the date of the Event of   Default
  at the rate equal to the lower of  20%  per
annum or the highest rate permitted   by  law  (the
  Default Rate  ).   

This
Note will become effective   only  upon
the execution   by   both parties, including
the execution of Exhibits B,   C,  D  and
 E  and the Irrevocable Transfer   Agent
  Instructions (the     Date   
 of Execution    ) and delivery of the
initial payment of   consideration   by 
 the Holder (the   Effective Date  ).   

This
Note may   be   prepaid
  by   the
Company, in whole or in part, according   to
  the following schedule:  

After
180 days from the Effective Date this Note   may
 not be prepaid without written consent from Holder, which consent  may  be
withheld, delayed or denied in Holder s sole and absolute discretion. Whenever  any  amount
expressed to be due   by   the terms of this
Note is due on  any  day   which is not  a
 Business  Day  (as defined below), the same shall
instead be due on the  next  succeeding   day
  which is  a  Business  Day.  If
 the  Note is in default, per Section 2.00(a) below, the Company   may
  not prepay the Note without written consent of  the  Holder.   

For
purposes hereof the following terms shall   have
 the meanings ascribed   to   them
below:   

Business
Day    shall mean   any
  day  other
than  a  Saturday, Sunday or  a day  on
which commercial banks in the  City  of   New
York are authorized or required   by   law 
 or executive order to remain closed.   

Conversion
 Price      shall be equal to lower
 of:  (a) 65% of the lowest trading price of the   Company s
  common stock during the 25 consecutive Trading Days prior to the date on which   Holder
elects to convert all or part of the Note  or (b) 65% of the lowest trading price of the
  Company s   common stock during the
25 consecutive Trading Days prior to the Effective   Date.   For
the purpose of calculating the Conversion Price only,   any   time
after 4:00 pm Eastern Time (the closing time of  the  Principal Market) shall be considered
to be  the  beginning of the  next  Business
Day.   If  the Company is placed on  chilled  status with the Depository
Trust Company  (  DTC  ), the discount shall be increased   by
  10%,  i . e ., from  35% to 45%, until such chill is  remedied.
  If  the Company is not Deposits and  Withdrawal
 at Custodian (  DWAC  )  eligible   through
  their Transfer   Agent   and
DTC s Fast Automated Securities Transfer (  FAST  ) system, the discount will be increased   by
 5%,   i . e ., from  35%  to
40%.   In   the case of both, the discount
shall be  a  cumulative increase   of 
 15%,  i . e ., from  35%  to 50%. 
 Any   default of this Note not remedied within
the applicable cure period will result in  a  permanent additional 10% increase,  i . e .,
from 35% to 45%, in addition to  any  other discount, as provided above, to the Conversion
Price discount.   

Principal
Amount    shall   refer
  to the sum of (i)   the
 original principal amount of this Note (including  the  original
issue discount, prorated if the Note has not  been  funded in full), (ii)  any
 additional payments made   by   the
Holder towards the Principal  Sum,  (iii) all guaranteed and other accrued but unpaid
interest hereunder,  (iv) any  fees due hereunder,  (v)  liquidated
damages, and (vi)  any  default payments owing under the Note, in each case  previously
 paid or added to the  Principal Amount.  

Principal
      Market     
 shall refer to the primary exchange on which the Company s common stock is traded
or quoted.   

Trading
 Day      shall mean  a day
 on which there   is   trading
  or   quoting  for any security  on
the Principal   Market.   

Underlying
Shares     means   the shares   of
  common stock into which the Note is convertible (including interest, fees, liquidated
damages and/or principal payments in common stock as set forth herein) in accordance with the terms   hereof.   

The
following terms and conditions shall apply to this Note:  

Section
1.00  Conversion  .   

(a)              
  Conversion Right . Subject to the terms hereof and restrictions and limitations contained
herein,   beginning   180 days  from
 the Effective Date, the Holder shall  have the  right,
 at the  Holder's  sole option, at any time and  from
 time to time to  convert  in whole or in  part
the outstanding and unpaid Principal Amount under this Note into shares of Common Stock as per the Conversion Formula. The date
 of any  conversion notice (  Conversion Notice  ) hereunder shall
be referred to herein as  the    Conversion Date  .   

(b)              
  Stock Certificates or    DWAC .  The
Company will deliver to the Holder,  or  Holder s authorized designee, no later
than  2  Trading Days after the Conversion Date,  a  certificate
or certificates (which certificate(s) shall be   free   of
restrictive legends and trading restrictions if the shares of Common Stock underlying the portion of the Note being converted
are eligible under  a resale  exemption pursuant to Rule   144(b)(1)(ii)
  and Rule 144(d)(1)(ii) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) representing the
number of shares of Common  Stock  being acquired upon the conversion of this Note.
  In   lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing   

the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, provided the   Company's
  transfer agent 
 is participating in DTC s  FAST
program, the Company shall instead use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its transfer   agent
  to electronically transmit such shares issuable upon conversion to the Holder (or
its designee),   by   crediting the account
of the Holder s (or such designee s)  broker  with DTC through its DWAC
program (provided that the same time periods herein as for stock certificates shall apply).   

(c)             
  Charges and Expenses . Issuance of Common Stock to Holder, or  any  of
its   assignees,   upon the conversion of this
Note shall be made without charge   to   the
Holder  for any  issuance fee, transfer  tax,  legal
opinion and related charges, postage/mailing charge   or  any  other
expense with   respect   to  the  issuance
of such Common Stock. Company shall  pay  all Transfer Agent fees incurred from the
issuance of the Common Stock to Holder, as well as  any  and all other fees and charges
required   by  the  Transfer Agent as  a
 condition to effectuate such issuance.  Any such  fees
or charges, as noted in this Section that are paid   by   the
Holder (whether from the   Company s   delays,
  outright   refusal to pay, or otherwise),
will be automatically added to the Principal Sum of the Note and tack  back  to the
Effective Date for purposes of Rule 144.   

(d)              
  Delivery Timeline .   If   the
Company fails to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates (or shares through the DWAC program) pursuant to this
Section   (free   of  any  restrictions
on transfer or legends, if eligible) prior to  3  Trading Days after the Conversion
Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder as liquidated damages an amount equal to $2,000 per   day,
 until such certificate or  certificates  are delivered. The Company acknowledges
that it would  be extremely difficult or impracticable to determine the Holder s actual
damages and costs resulting from  a  failure   to
  deliver the Common  Stock  and the inclusion
herein of   any   such additional amounts
are  the  agreed   upon liquidated damages
representing  a  reasonable estimate of those damages and costs. Such liquidated damages
will be automatically added to the Principal Sum of the Note and tack back to the Effective  Date  for
purposes   of   Rule 144.   

(e)                 Reservation     of
Underlying Securities   . The Company covenants that it will at all times
reserve and  keep  available for Holder, out of its authorized and unissued Common
Stock solely for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of this Note, free from preemptive   rights   or   any   other
actual   contingent   purchase rights of
persons other than  the  Holder,  five times  the number of shares of Common
Stock as shall be issuable (taking into account the adjustments under this Section 1.00, but without regard to   any   ownership
limitations contained herein) upon the conversion of this Note (consisting of  the  Principal
Amount) to Common Stock (the   Required Reserve  ).  The  Company
covenants  that  all shares of Common Stock that shall be issuable will, upon
issue, be  duly  authorized, validly issued, fully-paid, non-assessable and
freely-tradable (if eligible).   If   the
amount of shares on reserve in Holder s name at the Company s transfer agent for this Note shall drop below the
Required Reserve, the Company will, within  2  Trading   Days   of
notification from Holder, instruct the transfer agent to increase the number of shares so that the Required Reserve is met,
and it is understood and acknowledged that if the   Company s   transfer
agent takes  2  additional Trading Days to reflect the Required Reserve that this
will not result in  a  breach   by   the
Company.   In   the event  that  the
Company does not instruct the transfer   agent   to
increase the number of shares so that the Required Reserve is met, the Holder will be allowed, if applicable, to provide this
instruction as per the terms of  the  Irrevocable Transfer Agent   Instructions   attached   to   this
Note. The Company agrees  that  the maintenance   of   the
Required Reserve is  a  material term of this Note and  any  breach   of   this
Section 1.00(e) will result in  a  default of the Note.   

(f)               
  Conversion     Limitation   .
  The Holder will not submit  a  conversion
to the Company that would result in the Holder beneficially owning more  than  9.99%
of the then total outstanding shares of the Company   (  Restricted     Ownership
  Percentage    ).   

(g)              
  Conversion Delays .   If  the  Company
fails to deliver shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in Section 1.00(b), the Holder, at   any
  time prior  to  selling all of those shares,
  may   rescind   any
  portion, in whole or in part, of that particular conversion attributable to the unsold
shares. The rescinded conversion amount will be returned to the Principal Sum with the rescinded conversion shares returned to
the Company, under the expectation that  any  returned conversion amounts will tack
back to the Effective   Date.   

(h)              
  Shorting and Hedging . Holder  may  not
engage   in  any   shorting 
or  hedging  transaction(s) in the Common Stock prior to conversion or at  any  time
while holding shares  of the Company s Common Stock.  

(i)                
  Conversion     Right   Unconditional   .
  If   the Holder shall provide  a
 Conversion Notice as provided herein, the   Company's
  obligations to deliver Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective

obligationsunder the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934, as amended (the   1934 Act  )
and the rules and guidelines issued by OTC Markets News Service, OTCMarkets.com and their affiliates, provided that the Company s
failure to timely file (A) the Company s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2016; and (B) the Company s

failure of the Company to abide by the terms of the right of first refusal contained in Section 4.00(h).  

(b)              
 Remedies .   If 
 an Event of   Default
  occurs, the outstanding
Principal Amount of this Note owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become, at the   Holder's
  election, immediately
  due  and
 payable  in cash at the   Mandatory Default Amount  . The Mandatory
Default Amount means 150% of the outstanding Principal Amount of this Note, which will tack back to the Effective Date for purposes
of Rule  144.  Commencing  5  days 
 after  the  occurrence of  any  Event
of Default that results in the eventual acceleration of this Note, this Note shall accrue additional interest, in addition to
the Note s  guaranteed  interest, at the Default Rate. Finally, commencing  5  days
after the occurrence   of  any  Event of
Default that results in the eventual acceleration of this Note, an additional permanent  10%  increase
to the Conversion Price discount will   go   into
effect.   In   connection with such acceleration
described herein, the Holder need  not  provide, and the Issuer hereby waives,   any
  presentment, demand, protest or other notice   of
 any  kind, and the Holder  may  immediately
and without expiration of  any  grace period enforce  any  and
all of its rights  and  remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under
applicable law. Such acceleration  may  be rescinded  and  annulled
  by  the  Holder at   any
  time prior   to   payment
hereunder and the Holder shall have all   rights   as
 a  holder of the note until such time, if any, as the Holder receives full payment
pursuant to this Section 2.00(b). No such rescission or annulment shall affect   any
  subsequent event of default or impair  any  right
  consequent thereon. Nothing herein shall limit the   Holder's
  right to pursue  any  other remedies available
to it at law or in equity including, without limitation,  a  decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief with respect   to   the
  Issuer's   failure to timely deliver certificates
representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof.   

Section
3.00  Representations and Warranties of Holder .  

Holder
  hereby  represents
and warrants to the Company that:   

(a)              
 Holder is an  accredited investor,  as such  term  is
defined in   Regulation  D  of the Securities
Act   of   1933, as amended (the    1933
 Act    ), and will acquire this Note
and the Underlying Shares (collectively,  the    Securities  ) for
its own account and not with  a  view to  a  sale
or distribution thereof as that term is used in Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in  a  manner
which would require registration under the 1933  Act  or   any
  state securities laws. Holder  has  such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that such Holder is capable  of  evaluating
the merits and risks of the Securities. Holder can  bear the  economic risk of the
Securities, has knowledge and experience in financial business matters and is capable of bearing and managing the risk of investment
in the Securities. Holder recognizes that the Securities  have  not been registered
under the 1933 Act, nor under the securities laws of   any   state
and, therefore, cannot be resold unless the resale of the Securities is   registered
  under the 1933 Act or unless an exemption from registration is available. Holder
 has  carefully considered and has, to the extent Holder believes  such  discussion
necessary, discussed with its professional, legal, tax and financial advisors, the suitability   of
  an investment in the Securities for its particular tax and financial situation and
its advisers, if such advisors were deemed necessary, and has determined that the Securities  are a  suitable
investment for it. Holder has not been offered the Securities   by  any  form
of general solicitation or advertising, including, but not limited to, advertisements, articles, notices or other communications
published in  any  newspaper,   magazine,
  or other similar   

media
or television or   radio  broadcast
or   any   seminar or meeting where, to Holders 
knowledge, those individuals that have attended  have  been invited   by
any  such  or similar means of general solicitation or advertising. Holder has had
an opportunity to ask questions   of   and
receive satisfactory answers from the   Company,   or
  any   person or persons acting   on
 behalf  of the   Company,   concerning
 the  terms and conditions of the Securities and the Company, and all such questions
have been answered to the full satisfaction of Holder. The  Company has  not supplied
Holder  any  information regarding the Securities or an investment in the Securities
other than as contained in this Agreement, and Holder is relying on its own   investigation
  and evaluation of the Company and the Securities and not on   any
  other information.   

(b)              
 The Holder is  a  limited liability company 
duly  organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of  the  state
of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to  carry  on
its business as now conducted.  The  Holder is  duly  qualified
to   transact   business and is in   good
  standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would  have
a  material adverse effect   on   its
business or properties.   

(c)              
 All corporate action has been taken on  the  part
of the Holder, its officers, directors and stockholders necessary for  the  authorization,
execution and delivery   of   this Note. The
Holder  has  taken all corporate action required to make all of the obligations of
the Holder reflected in the provisions of this Note, valid and enforceable obligations.   

(d)              
 Each certificate or instrument representing Securities will be endorsed with the following
legend (or  a  substantially similar legend), unless or until   registered
  under the  1933  Act:   

THE
 SECURITIES EVIDENCED  BY THIS  CERTIFICATE 
HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED  UNDER THE  SECURITIES
 ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,  TRANSFERRED,  ASSIGNED OR  HYPOTHECATED
 UNLESS  THERE  IS  AN   EFFECTIVE
 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT  UNDER SUCH ACT COVERING SUCH SECURITIES, THE  TRANSFER
 IS MADE IN  COMPLIANCE  WITH RULE 144  PROMULGATED
 UNDER SUCH ACT OR THE  COMPANY  RECEIVES AN  OPINION
 OF COUNSEL  FOR  THE HOLDER OF THESE  SECURITIES
 WHICH IS  REASONABLY SATISFACTORY  TO THE COMPANY, STATING THAT SUCH SALE,  TRANSFER,
ASSIGNMENT  OR  HYPOTHECATION  IS  EXEMPT
FROM  THE  REGISTRATION  AND  PROSPECTUS
 DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT.  

Section
4.00   General .    

(a)              
   Payment   
 of Expenses   .
  The  Company
  agrees   to pay all reasonable charges and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and expenses, which  may  be incurred   by
 the  Holder in successfully enforcing  this  Note
and/or collecting  any  amount due under  this  Note.   

(b)              
   Assignment, Etc. 
The Holder may assign or transfer this Note to any transferee at its sole discretion. This Note shall be binding upon the Company
and its successors and shall inure to the benefit of the Holder and its successors and permitted assigns.(c)  Terms of Future
Financings . So long as this Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any convertible
debt security (whether such debt begins with a convertible feature or such feature is added at a later date) with any term more
favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided
to the Holder in this Note, then the Company shall notify the Holder of such additional or more favorable term and such term,
at the Holder's option, shall become a part of this Note and its supporting documentation.. The types of terms contained in the
other security that may be more favorable to the holder of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion
discounts, conversion look back periods, interest rates, original issue discount percentages and warrant coverage.  

(d)              
 Governing     Law;
    Jurisdiction   .  

(i)                
    Governing Law.

of the law  of any  other  jurisdiction.  

(ii)              
Jurisdiction     and
    Venue   .
  Any  dispute
or claim arising to or in   any  way  related
to this Note or the rights and obligations of each   of   the
parties shall be brought  only  in the state courts of California or in the federal
courts located in San   Diego   County, 
 California.   

(iii)            
    No   
 Jury Trial   .
  The   Company
hereto knowingly   and 
 voluntarily waives   any
  and all   rights
  it   may
  have   to
  a  trial
 by  jury with respect   to   any
  litigation based   on,   or
arising out   of,   under,   or
in   connection   with,   this
  Note.   

(iv)             
    Delivery of Process
by     the  Holder
to the Company     .
  In   the event of an action or proceeding
  by   the Holder against the Company, and
 only  by  the  Holder against the 
 Company,   service of copies of summons and/or
complaint and/or  any  other process that   may
be   served in   any  such  action
or proceeding   may   be  made  by
  the Holder via  U.S.  Mail,   overnight

process server, or   by   mailing or otherwise
delivering  a copy  of   such process to the
Company at its last known attorney as set forth in its most recent  SEC  filing.   

(v)               
    Notices   .
  Any  notice
required or permitted hereunder (including Conversion Notices)  must  be in writing

all material, non-public information delivered to the Holder   by  the  Company,
  or  any  of its officers, directors, employees,
or agents in connection with the transactions contemplated   by   this
Note. The Company and the Holder shall consult with each other in issuing   any 
 other   press   releases
with respect to the transactions   contemplated   hereby,
and neither  the  Company  nor  the Holder
shall issue   any  such  press release  nor

statement without the prior consent of  the  Company,   with
respect to  any  press release of the Holder, or without the prior consent of the Holder,

or include the name of the Holder in   any   filing
with the SEC or  any  regulatory agency   or
  Principal Market, without the prior written consent of the Holder, except to the

case the Company shall provide the Holder with prior notice of such disclosure permitted hereunder.   

The
Company   agrees 
 that this is   a
 material term of this Note and   any   breach

(h)              
   Right

 oral proposal  (the     Proposal  )
 containing  one or  more offers to provide additional capital or  equity
or  debt financing (the   Financing Amount  ),  the  Company
 agrees  that  it  shall provide a copy
 of   all  documents received relating  to
the  Proposal  together  with a complete  and
 accurate description  of  the Proposal  to
 the Holder and  all  amendments,  revisions,
and supplements  thereto  (the     Proposal
   Documents  )  no  later than 3  business
 days  from  the receipt  of  the Proposal
 Documents.  Following  receipt   of
the  Proposal  Documents  from the Company,  the
 Holder  shall  have the  right  (the
   Right     of First  Refusal  ),
 but not  the  obligation,  for a period
 of  5 business days thereafter  (the    Exercise
Period  ),  to  invest,  at  similar
or  better  terms  to   the
 Company,  an  amount  equal to   or
  greater  than the Financing Amount,  upon
  written  notice  to  the  Company
 that the Holder is exercising the  Right  of First Refusal provided hereby.
In furtherance  of  the Right of First Refusal,  the
Company   agrees  that  it will  cooperate
and  assist   the  Holder  in
 conducting a  due  diligence investigation  of
 the  Company  and its corporate and financial affairs and promptly provide the
Holder with information and documents  that  the Holder  may
 reasonably request  so   as   to
  allow   the  Holder  to
 make  an  informed investment decision. However, the  Company
 and  the  Holder  agree  that  the
 Holder  shall  have  no  more than
5  business days  from and after  the   expiration
of  the Exercise Period  to  exercise its Right  of
 First Refusal hereunder. This Right  of  First Refusal shall extend to all purchases
 of  debt held  by,  or assigned to  or
 from, current stockholders, vendors,  or  creditors, all transactions under Sections
3(a)9 and/or 3(a)10  or the  Securities Act  of
 1933, as amended, and  all  equity line-of-credit transactions.

                                           of
                                           (a)

                                           amount
                                           of

                                           Note

                                         and (c) Default Interest, if any, if so included at the Holder s sole  discretion.     

ii.     Conversion
                                         Price    means

                                         government or any department  or  agency thereof.

                                         within one business day to Holder confirming the details of the Conversion, and provide

v.    Liquidated
                                         Damages for Delinquent Response. If the Company fails to deliver for whatever reason
                                         (including any neglect or failure by,  e.g.,  the Company, its counsel or the transfer
                                         agent) to Holder the Shares as requested in a Conversion Notice within three (3) business
                                         days of the Conversion Date, the Company shall be deemed in  Default of Conversion. 
                                         Beginning on the fourth (4 th ) business day after
                                         the date of the Conversion Notice, after the Company is deemed in Default of Conversion,
                                         there shall accrue liquidated damages (the  Conversion Damages ) of $2,000
                                         per day for each day after the third business day until delivery of the Shares is made,
                                         and such penalty will be added to the Note being converted (under the Company s
                                         and Holder s expectation and understanding that any penalty amounts will tack back
                                         to the Issuance Date of the Note). The Parties agree that, at the time of drafting of
                                         this Note, the Holder s damages as to the delinquent response are incapable or
                                         difficult to estimate and that the liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast
                                         of just compensation.    

vi.    Liquidated
                                         Damages for Inability to Issue Shares. If the Company fails to deliver Shares requested
                                         by a Conversion Notice due to an exhaustion of authorized and issuable common stock such
                                         that the Company must increase the number of shares of authorized Common Stock before
                                         the Shares requested may be issued to the Holder, the discount set forth in the Conversion
                                         Price will be increased by 5 percentage points (i.e. from 40% to 45%) for the Conversion
                                         Notice in question and all future Conversion Notices until the outstanding principal
                                         and interest of the Note is converted or paid in full. These liquidated damages shall
                                         not render the penalties prescribed by Paragraph 2(e)(v) void, and shall be applied in
                                         conjunction with Paragraph 2(e)(v) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Holder.
                                         The Parties agree that, at the time of drafting of this Note, the Holder s damages
                                         as to the inability to issue shares are incapable or difficult to estimate and that the
                                         liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.    

vii.    Rescindment
                                         of Conversion Notice. If: (i) the Company fails to respond to Holder within one business
                                         day from the date of delivery of a Conversion Notice confirming the details of the Conversion,
                                         (ii) the Company fails to provide the Shares requested in the Conversion Notice within
                                         three business days from the date of the delivery of the Conversion Notice, (iii) the
                                         Holder is unable to procure a legal opinion required to have the Shares issued unrestricted
                                         and/or deposited to sell for any reason related to the Company's standing with the SEC
                                         or FINRA, or any action or inaction by the Company, (iv) the Holder is unable to deposit
                                         the Shares requested in the Conversion Notice for any reason related to the Company's
                                         standing with the SEC or FINRA, or any action or inaction by the Company, (v) if the
                                         Holder is informed that the Company does not have the authorized and issuable Shares
                                         available to satisfy the Conversion, or (vi) if OTC Markets changes the Company's designation
                                         to 'Limited Information' (Yield), 'No Information' (Stop Sign), 'Caveat Emptor' (Skull
                                         and Crossbones), or 'OTC', 'Other OTC' or 'Grey Market' (Exclamation Mark Sign) on the
                                         day of or any day after the date of the Conversion Notice, the Holder maintains the option
                                         and sole discretion to rescind the Conversion Notice ( Rescindment ) by delivering
                                         a notice of rescindment to the Company in the same manner that a Conversion Notice is
                                         required to be delivered to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Note.    

viii.    Transfer
                                         Agent Fees and Legal Fees. The issuance of the certificates shall be without charge  or

                                         legal fees, and advisory fees required for execution of this Note and processing of any
                                         Notice of Conversion, including but not limited to the cost of obtaining a legal opinion
                                         with regard to the Conversion. The Holder will deduct $2000 from the principal payment
                                         of the Note solely to cover the cost  of  obtaining
                                         any and all legal opinions required to obtain the Shares requested in any given Conversion
                                         Notice. These fees do not make provision for or suffice to defray any legal fees incurred
                                         in collection or enforcement of the Note as described in Paragraph 13.    

ix.    Conversion
                                         Right Unconditional. If the Holder shall provide a Notice of Conversion as provided herein,
                                         the Company s obligations to deliver Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional,

Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs, the Holder may in its sole discretion determine to request immediate repayment of all
or any portion of the Note that remains outstanding; at such time the Company will be required to pay the Holder the Default Amount
(defined herein) in cash. For purposes hereof, the  Default Amount  shall mean: the product of (A) the then outstanding

the Issuance Date, multiplied by (C) the highest price at which the Common Stock traded at any time between the Issuance Date
and the date of the Event of Default. If the Company fails to pay the Default Amount within five (5) Business Days of written
notice that such amount is due and payable, then Holder shall have the right at any time, so long as the Company remains in default
(and so long and to the extent there are a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares), to require the Company, upon
written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal
to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price then in effect.
