   General Overview    
 Enertopia Corp. was formed on November 24, 2004 under the laws
of the State of Nevada and commenced operations on November 24, 2004.  
 From inception until April 2010, we were primarily engaged in
the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. Beginning in
April 2010, we began our entry into the renewable energy sector by purchasing an
interest in a solar thermal design and installation company. In late summer
2013, we began our entry into medicinal marijuana business. During our 2014
fiscal year end our activities in the clean energy sector were discontinued.
During fiscal 2015 our activities in the Medicinal Marijuana sector were also
discontinued. 
 The Company is actively pursuing business opportunities in the
resource sector, whereby we signed a definitive agreement for a Lithium Brine in
May 2016. The Company continued in the health and wellness sector throughout
2015 and 2016, where the Company had launched the product V-Love  TM .
For strategic reasons the Company had discontinued the manufacturing and retail
distribution of V-Love TM  at the end of fiscal 2016. The Company s
main focus is in natural resource sector and patent pending technology used for
Lithium extraction through brines. 
 The address of our principal executive office is Suite 950,
1130 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4A4. Our telephone
number is (604) 602-1675. In addition, we have a second office located in
Kelowna, British Columbia. Our current locations provide adequate office space
for our purposes at this stage of our development.

has been in business for over 5 years showing good positive cash flows. All
products are manufactured by a GMP, NSF, FDA approved manufacturer in the United

   Chronological Overview of our Business over the Last Five
Years    
 Upon our inception on November 24, 2004, we were engaged in the
acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. On April 6, 2005 we
entered into an Exploration Agreement with Options for Joint Venture with
Miranda U.S.A., Inc. We had the option of acquiring an undivided 60% interest in
Miranda s lease in sixty-four mineral claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada.
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, we abandoned our option to acquire
the 60% interest in the Eureka County mineral lease claims.  
 Our management determined that the mineral exploration business
did not present the best opportunity for our company to realize value for our
shareholders at that time, and therefore investigated opportunities for our
Company to enter the natural gas and oil exploration sector. Accordingly, we
abandoned our previous business plan and focused on the exploration and
development of natural gas and oil properties.  
 On April 16, 2007, we acquired a 25% (net 15%) before payout
(12.5% (net 7.5%)) after payout interest in Queensdale, Saskatchewan Project
(known as the Queensdale Property) from 0743608 B.C. Ltd., a company controlled
by a Director/CEO of our company, for a total cost of CAD$250,000 and 250,000
shares (post consolidation) of our common stock.  

On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the
issued and outstanding common stock of Target Energy pursuant to a share
exchange agreement dated October 15, 2007 among our company, as purchaser, and
all of the shareholders of Target Energy, as vendors. In exchange for all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Target Energy, we issued to the shareholders of
Target Energy an aggregate of 6,905,000 shares (post consolidation) of our
common stock. Through our acquisition of Target Energy, we acquired an 8% gross
interest before payout in the Queensdale, Queensdale West HZ 4A9-25/3A15-25-6-2
W2 well (known as the Queensdale West property). We also acquired a 3.75% net
interest in two wells located in Wordsworth, Saskatchewan (known as the
Wordsworth property), which had one well at the time of acquisition and
eventually would see a second well drilled.  
 On April 21, 2008, we acquired a passive minority interest in
Pro Eco Energy USA Ltd., a private corporation focused on the installation and
integration of alternative energy   mainly solar thermal   systems in Western
Canada.  
 On May 14, 2008, we acquired one land parcel of 160 acres in
the Glen Park area of central Alberta, Canada. We subsequently entered into a
50/50 Joint Venture with Vanguard Exploration to explore and develop the joint
lands on Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease No. 0408050364. The joint
venture owns the Petroleum and Natural Gas rights below the base of the
Mannville GRP to basement.  
 On June 11, 2008, we acquired two land parcels of 160 acres
each in the Glen Park area of central Alberta, Canada. These 320 acres were
believed to be prospective for reef development and the potential accumulation
of oil deposits. We own the Petroleum and Natural Gas rights below the base of
the Mannville GRP to basement as to 100%.  
 In November 2008, the Wordsworth property that had the second
well was drilled and completed as a successful oil well in December 2008.  
 On December 8, 2008, Enertopia and its partner were successful
in acquiring 800 acres of land in the Coteau Lake project area and our company
owned a 50% gross and net interest in a total of 2,080 acres of land in this
area.  
 On July 31, 2009, we sold all of our interests in the
Queensdale, West Queensdale, and the Wordsworth properties for an aggregate
amount of CAD$453,116.  
 Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment
agreement with Cheetah Oil   Gas Ltd. The assignment agreement dated August
28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of
40.432% of an 8% share of Cheetah s net revenue after field operating expenses
from the Belmont Lake PP F-12-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field,
Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Cheetah
57.76% of Cheetah s costs currently budgeted at $77,905.36, subject to revision
and 57.76% of Cheetah s 8% share of PP F-12-4 well costs from time to time for
infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this

   Summary      
 The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining
further financing, a successful programs of development, and, finally, achieving
a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities
by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our
current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be
available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  
 There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further
funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing
various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial
requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional
financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as
planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become
due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our
operations. There is significant uncertainty as to whether we can obtain
additional financing.

V-Love TM
   Gel    

 On February 9, 2015, we announced the launch of a new product
line V-Love TM  for women s sexual pleasure. V-Love TM  a
brand new water based, silky smooth fragrance free personal lubricant and
intimate gel especially designed for women. V-Love TM  is a personal
lubricant and sexual desire gel to embrace the essence of what a female is sexy,
confident, playful, loving, and unique. V-Love TM  is carefully
designed to enhance/enrich each and every intimate experience to be the most
pleasurable and fulfilling it can be.  
 The Company used the feedback and life experience of women in
its formulation of V-Love TM . V-Love TM  was developed and
designed to offer a unique personal lubricant and sexual desire gel that could
be used safely and effectively by women who desired added lubrication.
V-Love TM  is designed to be used with, toys and foreplay, for
increasing sexual experience by lubricating so women feel confident with
intimacy with their partners or for their own personal pleasure. 
 The V-Love TM  gel finished its production run in
April, 2015. In May 2015, V-Love TM  first became available for retail
sale at Loblaws City Market store in North Vancouver, British Columbia.
Enertopia owns 100% of the product and its formulation. Enertopia engaged a GMP
compliant facility reputed to produce high quality cosmetic products for many
well-known brands. They are a Vancouver based manufacturer with over 150 years
of experience. They manufactured and formulated the final ingredients for V-Love
 TM  and handled all the production. 
 The Company held an initial launch on February 13, 2015 by
showcasing samples of V-Love TM  at the Vancouver Health and Wellness
Show and providing educational information on the gel. In May, 2015,
V-Love TM  was available to the retail market for purchase in stores
and at various events. 
 During the month of July, 2015 V-Love  TM  became
available for retail purchase at all London Drugs Limited stores across Western
Canada and online through Amazon.ca.  
 As at August 31, 2016, with the Company s strategic direction
mostly being focused on natural resources and technology relating to the
resource sector, the health and wellness portion of the business is
discontinued.  
   Alternative Health Operations Discontinued    
 Since June 12, 2015, the Company has had no direct involvement
or ownership interest in any active or prospective operations or permit
applications under the MMPR. 
 On June 26, 2015, we signed a Definitive agreement to sell our
wholly owned subsidiary, Thor Pharma Corp along with the MMPR application (no.
10MMPR0610) for our proposed production facility located in Burlington, Ontario.
The Burlington MMPR license application will continue in the application process
under new ownership. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a non-refundable
$10,000 deposit and are entitled to receive up to $1,500,000 in milestone
payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. These
monies would be split equally with our joint venture partner, Lexaria Corp.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we can neither guarantee nor provide a meaningful
time estimate regarding the potential grant of a production license for the
Burlington facility.  
    Investments         
 We currently hold the following investment interests:  
    Equity Investment in Pro Eco Energy,
Inc.         
 On April 21, 2008, we announced that we had made a $45,000
investment to acquire 8.25% of the equity of Pro Eco Energy USA Ltd., a clean
tech energy company involved in designing, developing and installing solar
energy solutions for commercial and residential customers. During fiscal year
2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our 8.25% ownership in Pro Eco Energy
for $40,000 to Western Standard Energy Corp. (now Dominovas Energy) The purchase
price was to be payable as follows: a) $10,000 on December 02, 2013; b) $10,000
on or before December 31, 2013; c) $10,000 on or before January 31, 2014; d)
$10,000 on or before February 28, 2014. As at August 31, 2015, we had collected
$10,000 of the $40,000 purchase price. As at August 31, 2015, we have received
back 600,000 of the 900,000 Pro Eco Energy shares from Western Standard Energy
Corp. and the accounts receivable has been settled upon the return of the shares. The
Company has no significant influence in Pro Eco Energy.  

The value of Pro Eco Energy s shares have been written to $1 by
management during the year ended August 31, 2016 due to management has assessed
the value of shares by reviewing Pro Eco Energy s operation and cash flows
situation and concluded it is unlikely to sell Pro Eco Energy s share in the
market. 
   Employees    
 We primarily used the services of sub-contractors and
consultants for our intended business operations. Our technical consultant is
Mr. McAllister, our president and a director.  
 We entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Robert
McAllister on December 1, 2007. During the term of this agreement, Mr.
McAllister is to provide corporate administration and consulting services, such
duties and responsibilities to include provision of oil and gas industry
consulting services, strategic corporate and financial planning, management of
the overall business operations of the Company, and supervising office staff and
exploration and oil   gas consultants. Mr. McAllister is reimbursed at the
rate of $2,000 per month. On December 1, 2008, the consulting fee was increased
to $5,000 per month. We may terminate this agreement without prior notice based
on a number of conditions. Mr. McAllister may terminate the agreement at any
time by giving 30 days written notice of his intention to do so. Effective March
1, 2014, the Company entered into a new Management Consulting Agreement
replacing the original agreement with a consulting fee of $6,500 plus GST per
month.  
 On October 9, 2009, the Company entered into a consulting
agreement with BKB Management Ltd, a corporation organized under the laws of the
Province of British Columbia. BKB Management controlled by the chief financial
officer of the Company, Bal Bhullar. A fee of CAD$4,675 including GST was paid
per month. We may terminate this agreement without prior notice based on a
number of conditions. BKB Management Ltd. may terminate the agreement at any
time by giving 30 days written notice of his intention to do so. Effective April
1, 2011, the fee is CAD$5,500 plus GST. Effective March 1, 2014, the Company
entered into a new Management Consulting Agreement replacing the original
agreement with a consulting fee of CAD$7,500 plus GST per month. On February 6,
2015, Ms. Bhullar was appointed as a director by the Board.  
 We do not expect any material changes in the number of
employees over the next 12 month period. We do and will continue to outsource
contract employment as needed. 
  Research and Development   
 We have incurred $13,067 in research and development
expenditures over the last two fiscal years.  

Item 1A.   
      Risk Factors     
 Our business operations are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to those set forth below:  
  Risks Associated with Our Business   
  Our company has no operating history and an evolving
business model,which raises doubt about our ability to achieve profitability or
obtain financing.   
 Our Company has no operating history. Moreover, our business
model is still evolving, subject to change, and will rely on the cooperation and
participation of our joint venture partners. Our Company's ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate financing
and to reach profitable levels of operations has and we no proven history of
performance, earnings or success. There can be no assurance that we will achieve
profitability or obtain future financing. 

Uncertain demand for mineral resources sector may cause our
business plan to be unprofitable.   
 Demand for mineral resources is based on the world economy and
new technologies. Current lithium demand exceeds available supply due to the
rapid increase in lithium batteries in portable electronics and the growing
electric vehicle markets. There can be no assurance that current supply and
demand factors will remain the same or that projected supply and demand factors
will actually come to pass from 3 rd  party projections that are
currently believed to be true and accurate. There can be no assurance that new
disruptive technologies will replace lithium as a significant component in
battery storage over time. 
  Conflicts of interest between our company and our directors
and officers may result in a loss of business opportunity.   
 Our directors and officers are not obligated to commit their
full time and attention to our business and, accordingly, they may encounter a
conflict of interest in allocating their time between our future operations and
those of other businesses. In the course of their other business activities,
they may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be
appropriate for presentation to us as well as other entities to which they owe a
fiduciary duty. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining
to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. They may
also in the future become affiliated with entities, engaged in business
activities similar to those we intend to conduct. 
 In general, officers and directors of a corporation are
required to present business opportunities to a corporation if: 

the corporation could financially undertake the
      opportunity;   

the opportunity is within the corporation s
      line of business; and   

it would be unfair to the corporation and its
      stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the
      corporation.    
 We plan to adopt a code of ethics that obligates our directors,
officers and employees to disclose potential conflicts of interest and prohibits
those persons from engaging in such transactions without our consent. Despite
our intentions, conflicts of interest may nevertheless arise which may deprive
our company of a business opportunity, which may impede the successful
development of our business and negatively impact the value of an investment in
our company. 
  The speculative nature of our business plan may result in
the loss of your investment.   
 Our operations are in the start-up or stage only, and are
unproven. We may not be successful in implementing our business plan to become
profitable. There may be less demand for our services than we anticipate. There
is no assurance that our business will succeed and you may lose your entire
investment. 
  Changing consumer preferences may cause our planned products
to be unsuccessful in the marketplace.  
 The decision of a potential client to undergo an environmental
audit or review may be based on ethical or commercial reasons. In some
instances, or with certain businesses, there may be no assurance that an
environmental review will result in any cost savings or increased revenues. As
such, unless the ethical consideration is also a material factor, there may be
no incentive for such businesses to undertake an environmental review. Changes
in consumer and commercial preferences, or trends, toward or away from
environmental issues may impact on businesses  decisions to undergo
environmental reviews. 

General economic factors may negatively impact the market
for our planned products.  
 The willingness of businesses to spend time and money on energy
efficiency may be dependent upon general economic conditions; and any material
downturn may reduce the likelihood of businesses incurring costs toward what
some businesses may consider a discretionary expense item. 
  A wide range of economic and logistical factors may
negatively impact our operating results.  
 Our operating results will be affected by a wide variety of
factors that could materially affect revenues and profitability, including the
timing and cancellation of customer orders and projects, competitive pressures
on pricing, availability of personnel, and market acceptance of our services. As
a result, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on
a quarterly and annual basis which could materially affect our business,
financial condition and operating results. 
  Changes In Environmental Regulations May Have An Impact On
Our Operations   
 We believe that we currently comply with existing environmental
laws and regulations affecting our proposed operations. While there are no
currently known proposed changes in these laws or regulations, significant
changes have affected the industry in the past and additional changes may occur
in the future. The company is subject to the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ),
State and potentially other government agencies with respect to its lithium
brine business.  
 Our operations may be subject to environmental laws,
regulations and rules promulgated from time to time by government. In addition,
certain types of operations require the submission and approval of environmental
impact assessments. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that means
stricter standards and enforcement. Fines and penalties for non-compliance are
more stringent. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a
heightened degree of responsibility for companies, directors, officers and
employees. The cost of compliance with changes in governmental regulations has
potential to reduce the profitability of operations. We intend to comply with
all environmental regulations in the United States and Canada.  
  Loss of consumer confidence in our company or in our
industry may harm our business.  
 Demand for our services may be adversely affected if consumers
lose confidence in the quality of our services or the industry s practices.
Adverse publicity may discourage businesses from buying our services and could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. Various factors may adversely impact our reputation, including
product quality inconsistencies or contamination resulting in product recalls.
Reputational risks may also arise from our third parties  labour standards,
health, safety and environmental standards, raw material sourcing, and ethical
standards. We may also be the victim of product tampering or counterfeiting or
grey imports. Any litigation, disputes on tax matters and pay structures may
subject us to negative attention in the press, which can damage reputation.  
  The failure to secure customers may cause our operations to
fail.   
 We currently have no long-term agreements with any customers.
Many of our sales may be on a  onetime  basis. Accordingly, we will require new
customers on a continuous basis to sustain our operations. Risk of material
impact on Group growth and profit of consumer led slowdown in key developing
markets, exacerbated by increasing currency volatility. A variety of factors may
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition during
periods of economic uncertainty or instability, social or labour unrest or
political upheaval in the markets in which we operate. Such periods may also
lead to government actions, such as imposition of martial law, trade
restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions, capital, price or currency
controls, nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, or
changes in legal and regulatory requirements and taxation regimes.  

If we fail to effectively and efficiently advertise, the
growth of our business may be compromised.  
 The future growth and profitability of our business will be
dependent in part on the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and
promotional expenditures, including our ability to (i) create greater awareness
of our products, (ii) determine the appropriate creative message and media mix
for future advertising expenditures, and (iii) effectively manage advertising
and promotional costs in order to maintain acceptable operating margins. There
can be no assurance that we will experience benefits from advertising and
promotional expenditures in the future. In addition, no assurance can be given
that our planned advertising and promotional expenditures will result in
increased revenues, will generate levels of service and name awareness or that
we will be able to manage such advertising and promotional expenditures on a
cost-effective basis. 
  Our success is dependent on our unproven ability to attract
qualified personnel.   
 We depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our
management team, consultants and advisors. There is strong competition for
qualified technical and management personnel in the business sector, and it is
expected that such competition will increase. Our planned growth will place
increased demands on our existing resources and will likely require the addition
of technical personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing
personnel. There can be no assurance that our compensation packages will be
sufficient to ensure the continued availability of qualified personnel who are
necessary for the development of our business. 
  We have a limited operating history with losses and we
expect the losses to continue, which raises concerns about our ability to
continue as a going concern.  
 We have generated minimal revenues since our inception and
will, in all likelihood, continue to incur operating expenses with minimal
revenues until we are able to successfully develop our business. Our business
plan will require us to incur further expenses. We may not be able to ever
become profitable. These circumstances raise concerns about our ability to
continue as a going concern. We have a limited operating history and must be
considered in the start-up stage. 
 There is an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued
in connection with the financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016
with respect to their doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 2 to our financial statements for the year ended August 31,
2016, we have incurred a net loss of $525,501 for the year ended August 31, 2016
(net loss $1,149,433 for the year ended August 31, 2015) and as at August 31,
2016 has incurred cumulative losses of $12,440,597 that raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Our management has been able,
thus far, to finance the operations through equity financing and cash on hand.
There is no assurance that our company will be able to continue to finance our
company on this basis 
  Without additional financing to develop our business plan,
our business may fail.  
 Because we have generated only minimal revenue from our
business and cannot anticipate when we will be able to generate meaningful
revenue from our business, we will need to raise additional funds to conduct and
grow our business. We do not currently have sufficient financial resources to
completely fund the development of our business plan. We anticipate that we will
need to raise further financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for
financing and we can provide no assurance to investors that we will be able to
find such financing if required. The most likely source of future funds
presently available to us is through the sale of equity capital. Any sale of
share capital will result in dilution to existing security-holders. 
  We may not be able to obtain all of the licenses necessary
to operate our business, which would cause our business to fail.  
 Our operations require licenses and permits from various
governmental authorities related to the establishment of our planned facilities,
to the production, storage and distribution of our products, and to the disposal
of waste. We believe that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and
permits under applicable laws and regulations for our operations and believe we
will be able to comply in all material respects with the terms of such licenses
and permits. However, such licenses and permits are subject to
change in various circumstances. There can be no guarantee that we will be able
to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses and permits. 

Changes in health and safety regulation may result in
increased or insupportable financial burden on our company.  
 We believe that we currently comply with existing laws and
regulations affecting our product and operations. While there are no currently
known proposed changes in these laws or regulations, significant changes have
affected the industry in the past and additional changes may occur in the
future. 
 Our products and operations may be subject to unanticipated
regulations and rules promulgated from time to time by government, namely those
related to consumer health and safety which may render certain production
methods, ingredients, products or practices obsolete. The cost of compliance
with changes in governmental regulations has potential to reduce the viability
or profitability of our products or operations. 
  If we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel,
it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock
price.  
 Our success depends in large part on the continued services of
our executive officers and third party relationships. We currently do not have
key person insurance on these individuals. The loss of these people, especially
without advance notice, could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations and our stock price. It is also very important that we be able to
attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including technical personnel, to
accommodate our exploration plans and to replace personnel who leave.
Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, and there are a limited
number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these
conditions, we could be unable to recruit, train, and retain employees. If we
cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse
impact on our operating results and stock price. 
  If we fail to effectively manage our growth our future
business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources
may be strained.   
 As we proceed with our business plan, we expect to experience
significant and rapid growth in the scope and complexity of our business. We
will need to add staff to market our services, manage operations, handle sales
and marketing efforts and perform finance and accounting functions. We will be
required to hire a broad range of additional personnel in order to successfully
advance our operations. This growth is likely to place a strain on our
management and operational resources. The failure to develop and implement
effective systems, or to hire and retain sufficient personnel for the
performance of all of the functions necessary to effectively service and manage
our potential business, or the failure to manage growth effectively, could have
a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
  Risks Associated with the Shares of Our Company  
  Because we do not intend to pay any dividends on our shares,
investors seeking dividend income or liquidity should not purchase our
shares.  
 We have not declared or paid any dividends on our shares since
inception, and do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable
future. We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our
common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at
some point in the future, it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings,
if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of
any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of
Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings to implement our business
plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for
common stock in the foreseeable future. 
 Investors seeking dividend income or liquidity should not
invest in our shares. 

Because we can issue additional shares, purchasers of our
shares may incur immediate dilution and may experience further dilution.  
 We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares. The board
of directors of our company has the authority to cause us to issue additional
shares, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares,
without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders may
experience more dilution in their ownership of our company in the future. 
  Other Risks  
  Trading on the OCTQB and CSE may be volatile and sporadic,
which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult
for our stockholders to resell their shares.  
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB electronic quotation
service operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB
is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to
many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business
prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock
for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a
stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic
than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq or a
stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty
reselling any of the shares. 
  Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be
restricted by the Securities and Exchange Commission s penny stock regulations
which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.  
 Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines  penny stock  to be
any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per
share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose
additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons
other than established customers and  accredited investors . The term
 accredited investor  refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of
$5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual
income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock
rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not
otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure
document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission which
provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the
penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with
current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the
broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account
statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s
account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson
compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing
prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing
before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules
require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from
these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that
the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements
may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary
market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently,
these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our
securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest
in and limit the marketability of our common stock. 
  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has
adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholder s ability
to buy and sell our stock.  
 In addition to the  penny stock  rules described above, FINRA
has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer,
a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment
is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status,
tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced
securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy
our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and
have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 

We believe that our operations comply, in all material
respects, with all applicable environmental regulations.  
 Our operating partners maintain insurance coverage customary to
the industry; however, we are not fully insured against all possible
environmental risks. 
  Any change to government regulation/administrative practices
may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our
profitability.  
 The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative
practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the
United States, Canada, or any other jurisdiction, may be changed, applied or
interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our
company to carry on our business. 
 The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of
any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may
have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a
negative impact on our ability to operate and/or our profitably. 
  Because we can issue additional shares, purchasers of our
shares may incur immediate dilution and may experience further dilution.  
 We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares. The board
of directors of our company has the authority to cause us to issue additional
shares, and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares,
without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders may
experience more dilution in their ownership of our company in the future. 
  Our by-laws contain provisions indemnifying our officers and
directors against all costs, charges and expenses incurred by them.  
 Our by-laws contain provisions with respect to the
indemnification of our officers and directors against all costs, charges and
expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment,
actually and reasonably incurred by him, including an amount paid to settle an
action or satisfy a judgment in a civil, criminal or administrative action or
proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of his being or having been one
of our directors or officers. 
  Investors  interests in our company will be diluted and
investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if we issue
additional shares or raise funds through the sale of equity securities.  
 Our constating documents authorize the issuance of 200,000,000
shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. In the event that we are
required to issue any additional shares or enter into private placements to
raise financing through the sale of equity securities, investors  interests in
our company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book
value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. If we
issue any such additional shares, such issuances also will cause a reduction in
the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. Further,
any such issuance may result in a change in our control. 
  Our by-laws do not contain anti-takeover provisions, which
could result in a change of our management and directors if there is a take-over
of our company.  
 We do not currently have a shareholder rights plan or any
anti-takeover provisions in our By-laws. Without any anti-takeover provisions,
there is no deterrent for a take-over of our company, which may result in a
change in our management and directors. 

As a result of a majority of our directors and officers are
residents of other countries other than the United States, investors may find it
difficult to enforce, within the United States, any judgments obtained against
our company or our directors and officers.  
 Other than our operations offices in Vancouver and Kelowna,
British Columbia, we do not currently maintain a permanent place of business
within the United States. In addition, a majority of our directors and officers
are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and
all or a substantial portion of such persons  assets are located outside the
United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within
the United States any judgments obtained against our company or our officers or
directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof. 
  Trends, risks and uncertainties.  
 We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most
significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what
extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have
identified all possible risks that might arise such as a black swan event. An
absolute worst case scenario with sufficient potential impact to risk the future
of the company as an independent business operating in its chosen markets.
Significant reputational impact as a result of a major issue resulting in
multiple fatalities, possibly compounded by apparently negligent management
behavior; extreme adverse press coverage and viral social media linking the
Company name to consumer brands, leads to a catastrophic share price fall, very
significant loss of consumer confidence and inability to retain and recruit
quality people. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors
before making an investment decision with respect to our common shares.

  Equity Compensation Plan Information   
 We have no long-term incentive plans other than the stock
option plan described below:  
  2007 Equity Compensation Plan   
 On April 25, 2007, our shareholders approved and adopted the
2007 equity incentive plan. The purpose of the Plan is to secure for our company
and our shareholders the benefits of incentive inherent in share ownership by
the directors and employees of our company and our Affiliates who, in the
judgment of our board, will be largely responsible for our company s future
growth and success. It is generally recognized that equity incentive plans of
the nature provided for herein aid in retaining and encouraging directors and
employees of exceptional ability because of the opportunity offered them to
acquire a proprietary interest in our company.  
 The maximum number of Options available under the Plan, are for
the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock of our company.  
 On December 14, 2007, we granted 892,500 post share
consolidation stock options to directors, officers, and consultants of our
company exercisable at a price of $0.70 per share for a period of 5 years. On
October 22, 2009, we modified the exercise price of these stock options to $0.20
per share. The vesting dates of the options are as below:  

On October 22, 2009, we granted an additional 500,000 stock
options to our directors and consultants. The exercise price of the stock
options is $0.10 per share, which are vested immediately and expire October 22,
2014. This plan was rolled into the 2011 Stock Option Plan as approved by our
shareholders on April 14, 2011.  

2010 Equity Compensation Plan   
 On February 5, 2010, our shareholders approved and adopted the
2010 equity incentive plan. The purpose of the 2010 Plan is to enhance the
long-term stockholder value of our company by offering opportunities to our
directors, officers, employees and eligible consultants to acquire and maintain
stock ownership in our company in order to give these persons the opportunity to
participate in our growth and success, and to encourage them to remain in our
service.  
 Options that are eligible for grant under the 2010 Plan to
Participants include: (a) incentive stock options, whereby we will grant options
to purchase shares of our common stock to Participants with the intention that
the options qualify as "incentive stock options" as that term is defined in
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code; (b) non-incentive stock options,
whereby we will grant options to purchase shares of our common stock to
Participants that do not qualify as "incentive stock options" under the Internal
Revenue Code; (c) stock appreciation rights; and (d) restricted shares. The 2010
Plan provides that a maximum of Two Million (2,000,000) shares of common stock
are available for granting of awards under the 2010 Plan.  
 This plan was rolled into the 2011 Stock Option Plan as
approved by our shareholders on April 14, 2011.  
  2011 Stock Option Plan   
 On April 14, 2011, our shareholders approved and adopted at the
Annual General Meeting to roll our 2007 Equity compensation plan and our 2010
Equity Compensation Plan into a new 2011 Stock Option Plan. The purpose of this
Plan is to advance the interests of our company, through the grant of Options,
by providing an incentive mechanism to foster the interest of eligible persons
in the success of our company and our affiliates; encouraging eligible persons
to remain with our company or our affiliates; and attracting new directors,
officers, employees and consultants.  
 This Plan shall be administered by our board. Subject to the
provisions of this Plan, our board shall have the authority: to determine the
Eligible Persons to whom Options are granted, to grant such Options, and to
determine any terms and conditions, limitations and restrictions in respect of
any particular Option grant, including but not limited to the nature and
duration of the restrictions, if any, to be imposed upon the acquisition, sale
or other disposition of shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the
Option, and the nature of the events and the duration of the period, if any, in
which any Participant's rights in respect of an Option or shares of common stock
acquired upon exercise of an Option may be forfeited; to interpret the terms of
this Plan, to make all such determinations and take all such other actions in
connection with the implementation, operation and administration of this Plan,
and to adopt, amend and rescind such administrative guidelines and other rules
and regulations relating to this Plan, as it shall from time to time deem
advisable, including without limitation for the purpose of ensuring compliance
with Section legislation hereof. Our board's interpretations, determinations,
guidelines, rules and regulations shall be conclusive and binding upon our
company, Eligible Persons, Participants and all other persons.  
 The aggregate number of Common Shares that may be reserved,
allotted and issued pursuant to Options shall not exceed 4,720,348 shares of
common stock, less the aggregate number of shares of common stock then reserved
for issuance pursuant to any other share compensation arrangement. For greater
certainty, if an Option is surrendered, terminated or expires without being
exercised, the Common Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to such Option shall
be available for new Options granted under this Plan.  
  2014 Stock Option Plan   
 On July 15, 2014, the shareholders approved and adopted at the
Annual General Meeting the Company s 2014 Stock Option Plan. The purpose of
these Plan is to advance the interests of the Corporation, through the grant of
Options, by providing an incentive mechanism to foster the interest of eligible
persons in the success of the Corporation and its affiliates; encouraging
eligible persons to remain with the Corporation or its affiliates; and
attracting new Directors, Officers, Employees and Consultants.  
 This Plan shall be administered by our board. Subject to the
provisions of this Plan, our board shall have the authority: to determine the
Eligible Persons to whom Options are granted, to grant such Options, and to
determine any terms and conditions, limitations and restrictions in
respect of any particular Option grant, including but not limited to the nature
and duration of the restrictions, if any, to be imposed upon the acquisition,
sale or other disposition of shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of
the Option, and the nature of the events and the duration of the period, if any,
in which any Participant's rights in respect of an Option or shares of common
stock acquired upon exercise of an Option may be forfeited; to interpret the
terms of this Plan, to make all such determinations and take all such other
actions in connection with the implementation, operation and administration of
this Plan, and to adopt, amend and rescind such administrative guidelines and
other rules and regulations relating to this Plan, as it shall from time to time
deem advisable, including without limitation for the purpose of ensuring
compliance with Section legislation hereof. Our board's interpretations,
determinations, guidelines, rules and regulations shall be conclusive and
binding upon our company, Eligible Persons, Participants and all other persons. 

The aggregate number of Common Shares that may be reserved,
allotted and issued pursuant to Options shall not exceed 17,400,000 shares of
common stock, less the aggregate number of shares of common stock then reserved
for issuance pursuant to any other share compensation arrangement. For greater
certainty, if an Option is surrendered, terminated or expires without being
exercised, the Common Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to such Option shall
be available for new Options granted under this Plan.  
 The Board may amend, subject to the approval of any regulatory
authority whose approval is required, suspend or terminate this Plan or any
portion thereof. No such amendment, suspension or termination shall alter or
impair any outstanding unexercised Options or any rights without the consent of
such Participant. If this Plan is suspended or terminated, the provisions of
this Plan and any administrative guidelines, rules and regulations relating to
this Plan shall continue in effect for the duration of such time as any Option
remains outstanding.  
 As at the date of the annual report, there was nil stock
options exercised except for those disclosed in the regulatory filings and in
the notes to the financial statements.

Item 7.   
      Management s Discussion and Analysis of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this
annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that
reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that
could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to;
those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the
section entitled Risk Factors beginning on page 10 of this annual report.  
 Our audited financial statements are stated in United States
Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles.  
  Plan of Operation   
 During the next twelve month period (beginning September 1,
2016), we intend to:  

identify and secure sources of equity and/or
      debt financing for property payments;   

identify and secure sources of equity and/or
      debt financing for resource acquisitions;   

identify and secure sources of equity and/or
      debt financing for pilot testing for Lithium technology
   
 We anticipate that we will incur the following operating
expenses during this period:  

As at the date of this annual report, we do not have sufficient
cash on hand to finance our entire potential and estimated $509,000 cash
obligation to the proposed spending for the 12 months beginning September 1,
2016. Based on our current cash position of $31,034, we anticipate that we will
require $480,000 in additional cash to execute our business plan. In the event
that we are unable raise sufficient cash we intend to reduce our planned
expenditures to accommodate our means with a view toward prioritizing revenue
generating activity and fulfilling our public reporting obligations. As at the
date of this registration statement we have no financing arrangements in
place.

 Our net loss and comprehensive loss for our year ended August
31, 2016, for our year ended August 31, 2015 and the changes between those
periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:  
 
   Other Income and Revenue    
 The increase in revenue for year ended August 31, 2016, relates
to the sales for the new product V-Love that entered the retail market in May
2015. Other income is consistent with prior year. The decrease in other (income)
expenses of $52,992 relates to the write down of the V-Love inventory, losses
from sale of Lexaria shares and the decrease in market value of Pro Eco shares
compared to the other income of $94,947 for year ended August 31, 2015, relates
to the cancellation of The Green Canvas Joint Venture with common shares of the
Company being returned back to treasury and cancelled. 
   General and Administrative    
 Our general and administrative expenses were lower by $770,727
for our year ended August 31, 2016 compared to August 31, 2015. The decrease in
costs were largely due non-renewal of consulting contracts by $518,308. In
addition the Company decreased costs of $167,360 for advertising, $24,786 for
investor relations, $49,999 for rent, $13,209 for travel and $13,743 in professional fees for the
year ended August 31, 2016. These decreased costs are due to the Company s
termination of the joint ventures and the Company s efforts in reducing costs.  

Professional Fees    
 There was a decrease in accounting and legal fees for our year
ended August 31, 2016 by $13,743 compared to the prior year due to financings,
registration statements and additional legal advice.  
   Interest Expense    
 There was a slight increase in interest expense for our year
ended August 31, 2016 by $4,672 compared to the prior year. This amount includes
foreign exchange differences which is the reason for the slight increase in this
amount.  
   Exploration Costs    
 There were exploration costs of $11,437 for our year ended
August 31, 2016 compared to prior year. This is from the Nevada Lithium
properties that the Company has acquired.  
   Consulting Fees    
 There was a decrease in consulting fees for the year ended
August 31, 2016 compared to August 31, 2015 by $518,308. This was largely due to
non-renewal of consulting agreements and the termination of various joint
ventures. The Company has entered into various joint venture agreements, advisor
and consulting agreements which led to the increased costs in 2015.  
  Liquidity and Financial Condition   

Operating Activities    
 Net cash used in operating activities was $384,327 for our year
ended August 31, 2016 compared with cash used in operating activities of
$905,202 in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities is due
to our Company decrease in prepaid expenses and joint venture agreement
terminations compared to August 31, 2015.  

Investing Activities    
 Net cash provided from investing activities was $98,601 for our
year ended August 31, 2016 compared to net cash provided in investing activities
of $3,000 in the same period in 2015. The increase is from the sale of
marketable securities.  
   Financing Activities    
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $232,603 for our
year ended August 31, 2016 compared to $98,237 in the same period in 2015. This
increase is primarily due to increased financings compared to the prior year
end.  
  Contractual Obligations   
 As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to
provide tabular disclosure obligations.  
  Going Concern   
 Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have a net
loss of $525,501 for the year ended August 31, 2016 [2015   net loss of
$1,149,433] and at August 31, 2016 had a deficit accumulated during the
exploration stage of $12,440,597 [2015   $11,915,096]. We generated revenue of
$14,315 for the year ended August 31, 2016 [2015 - $8,632]. We have working
capital deficit of $232,387 as at August 31, 2016 [2015   working capital
surplus $18,890]. We require additional funds to maintain our existing
operations and to acquire new business assets. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in this regard are to raise equity and debt financing as
required, but there is no certainty that such financing will be available or
that it will be available at acceptable terms. The outcome of these matters
cannot be predicted at this time and the financing environment is exceptionally
difficult.  
 These financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or
the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.  
 At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance
that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common
stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next
twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future debt or
equity financing.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to stockholders.  
  Critical Accounting Policies   
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected
by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that
understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an
understanding of our financial statements.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies
several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions
including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is
effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and earlier
adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new
accounting guidance on its financial statements.  
 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued guidance that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of
financial assets. Under the new guidance, credit losses for certain types of
financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses. The new
guidance also modifies the impairment models for available for-sale debt
securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since
their origination. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first
quarter of fiscal 2021 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is
evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its financial
statements.  
 In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance to remove the requirement
to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair
value is measured using net asset value per share practical expedient. The
guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and
early adoption is permitted. The guidance will have no impact on the Company s
balance sheets or statements of operations or cash flows. 

Item 7A.   
      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
      About Market Risk     
 As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to
provide the information required by this Item.  

Item 8.   
      Financial Statements and Supplementary
      Data      

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
  Enertopia Corp.  
 We have audited the balance sheets of Enertopia Corp. (the
 Company ) (formerly Golden Aria Corp.) as at August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the
related statements of stockholders  equity, operations and cash flows for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstance, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as at August 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  
 The accompanying financial statements referred to above have
been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company incurred losses
from operations since inception, has not attained profitable operations and is
dependent upon obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its operating activities.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

      August 31, 2016    
   
      (Expressed in U.S. Dollars)    

1.   
     
        ORGANIZATION     
 The Company was formed on November 24,
2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada and commenced operations on November
24, 2004. The Company was an independent natural resource company engaged in the
exploration, development and acquisition of natural resources in the United
States and Canada. In the fiscal year 2010, the Company shifted its strategic
plan from its non-renewal energy operations to its planned renewal energy
operations and natural resource acquisition and development. In late summer of
2013, the Company had another business sector in alternative health and
wellness. During spring of 2016, the Company shifted its strategic plan to
natural resource acquisitions and Lithium brine extraction technology. The
Company has offices in Vancouver and Kelowna, B.C., Canada. 

2.   
     
        GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY     
 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company had a working capital
deficit of $232,387 for the year ended August 31, 2016 [surplus of $18,890 for
year ended August 31, 2015]. The Company incurred a net loss of $525,501 for the
year ended August 31, 2016 [net loss $1,149,433 for the year ended August 31,
2015] and as at August 31, 2016 has incurred cumulative losses of $12,440,597
that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management has been able, thus far, to finance the operations through equity
financing and cash on hand. There is no assurance that the Company will be able
to continue to finance the Company on this basis.  
 In view of these conditions, the
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt
and dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its
obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be
required, to receive the continued support of the Company s shareholders, and
ultimately to obtain successful operations. There are no assurances that the
Company will be able to obtain further funds required for its continued
operations. As noted herein, the Company is pursuing various financing
alternatives to meet its immediate and long-term financial requirements. There
can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company
when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable
terms. If the Company is not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely
basis, it will be unable to conduct its operations as planned, and it will not
be able to meet its other obligations as they become due. In such event, the
Company will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease its operations. There
is significant uncertainty as to whether the Company can obtain additional
financing. These financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments
which would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern and therefore be required to realize its assets and discharge its
liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different
from those reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  

3.   
     
        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES      

a)   
     
        Basis of Presentation     
 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  

b)   
     
        Revenue Recognition     
 The Company recognizes revenue from
product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title to
product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is
fixed or determinable, collection from the customer is reasonably assured, the
Company has no further performance obligation, and returns can be reasonably
estimated. 

c)   
     
        Cash and Cash Equivalents     
 Cash equivalents comprise certain
highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents consist of
cash only.  

d)   
     
        Marketable Securities     
 Marketable securities are classified
at fair value through profit (loss). They consist of equities which are all
traded in the public markets. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value,
with changes to fair value recorded in profit or loss.  

e)   
     
        Inventories and Cost of
Sales     
 The Company has two major classes of
inventory: finished goods and raw materials. In both classes, inventory is
valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in,

first-out basis. Cost of sales includes all expenditures incurred in bringing
the goods to the point of sale. Inventory costs and costs of sales include
direct costs of the raw material, inbound freight charges, warehousing costs,
handling costs (receiving and purchasing) and utilities and processing costs
charged by third parties. 

f)   
     
        Investments in Affiliated Companies Accounted for
      Using the Equity Method     
 Investments in equity method investees
are accounted for using the equity method based upon the level of ownership
and/or the Company s ability to exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of the investee. Investments of this nature are
recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company s
proportionate share of the investees  net income or losses after the date of
investment. When net losses from and investment accounted for under the equity
method exceeds its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero.
The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the
entity subsequently reports net income and the Company s share of that net
income exceed the share of the net losses not recognized during the period the
equity method was suspended. Investments are written down only when there is
clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has
occurred. When an investment accounted for using the equity method issues its
own shares, the subsequent reduction in the Company s proportionate interest in
the investee is reflected in income as a deemed dilution gain or loss on
disposition. The Company evaluates its investments in companies accounted for
the equity or cost method for impairment when there is evidence or indicators
that a decrease in value may be other than temporary.  

g)   
     
        Long term investments     
 Other long term investments for which
the Company has not have the ability to exercise significant influence and for
which there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted for under
the cost method of accounting, such that they are recorded at the lower of cost
or estimated net realizable value. Management periodically reviews the cost
method investments for instances where fair value is less than the carrying
amount and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. If the
decline in value is judged to be other than temporary, the carrying amount of
the security is written down to fair value and the resulting loss is charged to
operations. 

h)   
     
        Mineral Properties     
 Acquisition costs of mineral rights
are initially capitalized as incurred while exploration and pre-extraction
expenditures are expensed as incurred until such time proven or probable
reservesare established for that project. Acquisition costs include cash
consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of
mineral properties. 
 Expenditures relating to exploration
activities are expensed as incurred and expenditures relating to pre-extraction
activities are expensed as incurred until such time proven or probable reserves
are established for that project, after which subsequent expenditures relating
to development activities for that particular project are capitalized as
incurred. 
 Where proven and probable reserves
have been established, the project s capitalized expenditures are depleted over
proven and probable reserves using the units-of-production method upon
commencement of production. Where proven and probable reserves have not been
established, the project s capitalized expenditures are depleted over the
estimated extraction life using the straight-line method upon commencement of
extraction. The Company has not established proven or probable reserves for any
of its projects. 
 The carrying values of the mineral
rights are assessed for impairment by management on a quarterly basis and as
required whenever indicators of impairment exist. An impairment loss is
recognized if it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable and
exceeds fair value. 

i)   
     
        Stock-Based Compensation     
 The Company followed Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  ,
to account for its stock options and similar equity instruments issued.
Accordingly, compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity
instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and
expensed over the expected vesting period. ASC 718 requires excess tax benefits
be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.

j)   
     
        Accounting Estimates     
 The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions.  

k )   
     
        Loss Per Share     
 Loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The Company has
adopted ASC 220   Earnings Per Share  . Diluted loss per share is
equivalent to basic loss per share because the potential exercise of the
equity-based financial instruments was anti-dilutive.  

m)   
     
        Foreign Currency
Translations     
 The Company s operations are located
in the United States of America and it has offices in Canada. The Company
maintains its accounting records in U.S. Dollars, as follows:  
 At the transaction date, each asset,
liability, revenue and expense that was acquired or incurred in a foreign
currency is translated into U.S. dollars by the using of the exchange rate in
effect at that date. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at that date. The resulting foreign
exchange gains and losses are included in operations.  

n)   
     
        Financial Instruments     
 ASC 820   Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures   requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective
evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial
instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820
prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair
value: 
 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
 Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and  
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to
develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing.  
 The Company s financial instruments
consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and due to related parties. With the exception of
marketable securities, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments
approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The fair value of
marketable securities are measured based on quoted prices in active markets.
Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were in level 1 within the
fair value hierarchy.  
 The Company s operations are in United
States of America and Canada, which results in exposure to market risks from
changes in foreign currency rates. The financial risk is the risk to the
Company s operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use
derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk.  

o)   
     
        Income Taxes     
 The Company has adopted ASC 740,
  Income Taxes  , which requires the Company to recognize deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns using
the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the
year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period
that includes the enactment date. In addition, a valuation allowance is
established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is more
likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.  

p)   
     
        Long-Lived Assets
Impairment     
 In accordance with ASC 360,
 Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets , the carrying value
of long lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if
any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its
estimated fair value. 

q)   
     
        Asset Retirement
Obligations     
 The Company accounts for asset
retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of  ASC 410,  Asset
Retirement and Environmental Obligations  . ASC 410 requires the Company to
record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the
period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or normal use of the assets. The management of the Company had
estimated the asset retirement obligation to be immaterial and therefore was not
reflected on the financial statements as of August 31, 2016 and 2015. 

r)   
     
        Comprehensive Income     
 The Company has adopted ASC 220,
  Comprehensive Income  , which establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. The
Company is disclosing this information on its Statement of Stockholders  Equity.
Comprehensive income comprises equity except those transactions resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners.  

s)   
     
        Concentration of credit
risk     
 The Company places its cash and cash
equivalent with high credit quality financial institution. As of August 31,
2016, the Company had $218 in a bank beyond insured limit (August 31, 2015:
$65,132).  

t)   
     
        Recently Adopted Accounting
  Pronouncements     
 In June 2014, ASU guidance was issued
to resolve the diversity of practice relating to the accounting for stock-based
performance awards for which the performance target could be achieved after the
employee completes the required service period. Adoption of the new guidance,
effective for the fiscal year beginning September 1, 2015, had no impact on the
Company s balance sheets or statements of operations or cash flows. 

u)   
     
        New Accounting
Pronouncements     
 In March 2016, the FASB issued
guidance which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment
award transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal
2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of
adopting this new accounting guidance on its financial statements.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance
that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets.
Under the new guidance, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments
will be estimated based on expected losses. The new guidance also modifies the
impairment models for available for-sale debt securities and for purchased
financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  

The guidance is effective for the
Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on
its financial statements.  
 In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance
to remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all
investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share
practical expedient. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first
quarter of fiscal 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The guidance will have
no impact on the Company s balance sheets or statements of operations or cash
flows. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued
guidance on how to account for and disclose going concern risk. The guidance is
effective for the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and earlier
adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new
accounting guidance on its financial statements. 

4.   
     
        MARKETABLE SECURITIES     
 As at August 31, 2016 marketable
securities consist of 156,500 common shares of Lexaria Corp. obtained through
Definitive Agreements as that was signed on March 5, 2014. The Company
classified the securities owned as held-for-trade and recorded at fair value.
 
 The fair value of the common shares of

      Controls and Procedures 
     
   Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and
Procedures    
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and
chief executive officer (also our principal executive officer) and our chief
financial officer (also our principal financial and accounting officer) to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 As of August 31, 2016, the end of our fiscal year covered by
this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our president and chief executive officer (also our principal
executive officer) and our chief financial officer (also our principal financial
and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president and

   Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting    
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates
and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and
related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include
providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets
are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that
transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and
recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of August 31, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in  Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
Our management has concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, our internal control
over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US generally
accepted accounting principles. Our management reviewed the results of their
assessment with our Board of Directors.  
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of
our Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our
Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our Company to provide only
management s report in this annual report.  
   Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls  
 
 Internal control over financial reporting has inherent
limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent
professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or
changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of
organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and
compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from
human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be
circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to
design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting    
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting that occurred during the year ended August 31, 2016 that
have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.

vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:  

i.  
     
       Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or
      regulation; or   

ii.  
     
       Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions
      or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or
      permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money
      penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or

defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))),
or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has
disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934   
 Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires
our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of our
common stock to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial
statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual
reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity
securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and
greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us
with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file.  
 Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received
by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe
that during fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, all filing requirements
applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial
owners were complied with, with the exception of the following:  

Name   
      Number of
      Late    Reports   
      Number
      of    Transactions Not    Reported on a Timely 
        Basis   
      Failure to
    File    Requested Forms    

Notes: 

(1)    
     
       The director / officer was late filing a Form 4, Change
      of Beneficial Ownership.   
   
      (2)    
     
       The director / officer was late filing a Form 3, Initial
      Statement of Beneficial Ownership.    
  Code of Ethics   
 We adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our senior financial
officers and certain other finance executives, which is a "code of ethics" as
defined by applicable rules of the SEC. Our Code of Ethics is attached as an
exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB filed on November 29, 2007. If we
make any amendments to our Code of Ethics other than technical, administrative,
or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waivers, including implicit
waivers, from a provision of our Code of Ethics to our chief executive officer,
chief financial officer, or certain other finance executives, we will disclose
the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date and to whom it applies
in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.  
  Board and Committee Meetings   
 Our board of directors held no formal meetings during the year
ended August 31, 2016. All proceedings of the board of directors were conducted
by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the
minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in
writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the
directors are, according to the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws, as
valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors
duly called and held.  
  Nomination Process   
 As of August 31, 2016, we did not affect any material changes
to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board
of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the
consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our
board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate
our Company s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board
of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our
board, they may do so by sending communications to the president of our Company
at the address on the cover of this annual report.  

Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert  
 Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of
  directors. We currently do not have nominating, compensation committees or
  committees performing similar functions. There has not been any defined policy
  or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or
nomination for directors.  
 Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a
member of its board of directors (audit committee) that qualifies as an "audit
committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K,
and is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  
 We believe that the members of our board of directors are
collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We
believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit
committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we
currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees
performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation
or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is
necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such
committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.  

Item 11.   
      Executive Compensation 
   
 The particulars of the compensation paid to the following
persons:  

(a)  
     
       our principal executive officer;

       each of our two most highly compensated executive
      officers who were serving as executive officers at the end of the years
      ended August 31, 2016 and 2015; and   

(c)  
     
       up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure
      would have been provided under (b) but for the fact that the individual
      was not serving as our executive officer at the end of the years ended
      August 31, 2016 and 2015,    
 who we will collectively refer to as the named executive
officers of our Company, are set out in the following summary compensation
table, except that no disclosure is provided for any named executive officer,
other than our principal executive officers, whose total compensation did not
exceed $100,000 for the respective fiscal year:  

(1)           
On November 30, 2007, Mr. McAllister was appointed as our President and on April

the Company. A fee of CAD$4,675 including HST is paid per month. We may
terminate this agreement without prior notice based on a number of conditions.
BKB Management Ltd. may terminate the agreement at any time by giving 30 days

have not entered into any employment or consulting agreements with any of our
current officers, directors or employees.  

Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table  
 On April 14, 2011, the shareholders approved and adopted at the
  Annual General Meeting to consolidate the Company s 2007 Equity compensation
  plan and the Company s 2010 Equity Compensation Plan into a new Company 2011
  Stock Option Plan. The purpose of this Plan is to advance the interests of the
  Corporation, through the grant of Options, by providing an incentive mechanism
  to foster the interest of eligible persons in the success of the Corporation and
  its affiliates; encouraging eligible persons to remain with the Corporation or
  its affiliates; and attracting new Directors, Officers, Employees and
  Consultants.  
 On November 5, 2013 the Company granted 675,000 stock options

  Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End   
 The particulars of unexercised options, stock that has not
vested and equity incentive plan awards for our named executive officers are set
out in the following table:  

Option Exercises   
 During our fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, 240,000 stock
options were exercised by the CEO of the Company.  
  Compensation of Directors   
 Except as otherwise disclosed, we do not have any agreements
for compensating our directors for their services in their capacity as
directors, although such directors are expected in the future to receive stock
options to purchase shares of our common stock as awarded by our board of
directors.  
  Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans   
 There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension,
retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have no
material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash
compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except
that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the board of directors or
a committee thereof.  
  Indebtedness of Directors, Senior Officers, Executive
Officers and Other Management   
 None of our directors or executive officers or any associate or
affiliate of our Company during the last two fiscal years is or has been
indebted to our Company by way of guarantee, support agreement, letter of credit
or other similar agreement or understanding currently outstanding.  

Item 12.   
      Security Ownership of Certain
      Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 
       
 The following table sets forth, as of October 7, 2016, certain
information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by
each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our
common shares, as well as by each of our current directors and executive
officers as a group. Each person has sole voting and investment power with
respect to the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial
ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common stock, except as
otherwise indicated.  

(1)    
     
       Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security
      includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
      arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i)
      voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of
      shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or
      direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be
      beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share
      the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition,
      shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has
      the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option)
      within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In
      computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares
      outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned
      by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition
      rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as
      shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual
      ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common
      stock actually outstanding on October 7, 2016. As of October 7, 2016,
      there were 93,562,031 shares of our company s common stock issued and
      outstanding.     

Changes in Control      
 We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement the
operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of our
company.  

Item 13.   
      Certain Relationships and Related
      Transactions, and Director Independence     
 Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer,
shareholder holding at least 5% of shares of our common stock, or any family
member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any
transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended August 31, 2015, in
which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of
$120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for
the last two completed fiscal years.  

For the year ended August 31, 2016, the Company was party to
the following related party transactions:  
 
 The related party transactions are recorded at the exchange
amount established and agreed to between the related parties.  
  Director Independence   
 We currently act with three (3) directors, consisting of Robert
McAllister, Kevin Brown, and Bal Bhullar. We have determined that Donald Findlay
is an  independent director  as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).
 
 Currently our audit committee consists of three board of
directors. We currently do not have nominating, compensation committees or
committees performing similar functions. There has not been any defined policy
or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or
nomination for directors.  
 Our board of directors has determined that it does not have a
member of its audit committee who qualifies as an  audit committee financial
expert  as defined in as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.  
 From inception to present date, we believe that the members of
our audit committee and the board of directors have been and are collectively
capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding
internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.  
 We do not have a standing compensation or nominating committee,
but our entire board of directors act in such capacity. We believe that our
directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our
directors do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed
by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that retaining additional
independent directors who would qualify as an  audit committee financial expert 
would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances
given the early stages of our development.  

Item 14.   
      Principal Accounting Fees and Services 
       
 The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed
fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 and for fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 for
professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our
annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in
our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by
the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or
engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:  

Audit Fees.  Audit fees consist of fees billed for
professional services rendered for the audits of our financial statements,
reviews of our interim financial statements included in quarterly reports,
services performed in connection with filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and related comfort letters and other services that are normally
provided by MNP LLP for fiscal year ended August 31, 2016.  
  Audit related Fees.  There were $28,000 audit related
fees paid to MNP LLP for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 and $33,645 for
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015.  
  Tax Fees.  Tax fees consist of fees billed for
professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These
services include assistance regarding federal, state and local tax compliance
and consultation in connection with various transactions and acquisitions. For
the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, we did not use MNP
LLP for non-audit professional services or preparation of corporate tax returns.
 
 We do not use MNP LLP, for financial information system design
and implementation. These services, which include designing or implementing a
system that aggregates source data underlying the financial statements or
generates information that is significant to our financial statements, are
provided internally or by other service providers. We do not engage MNP LLP to
provide compliance outsourcing services.  
 Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission
adopted rules that require that before our independent auditors are engaged by
us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement
be:  

approved by our audit committee (which consists of our
      entire board of directors); or    

entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and
      procedures established by the board of directors, provided the policies
      and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the board of
      directors is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do
      not include delegation of the board of directors' responsibilities to
      management.     
 Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by
our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and
approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective
services were rendered.  
 Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of
fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of
services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining
our independent auditors  independence.

       Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any

      necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under

      report;   

4.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
      responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
      procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and

      control over financial reporting; and     

5.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have

b.  
     
       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves

reporting.

 I, Bal Bhullar, certify that:  

1.  
     
       I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of
      Enertopia Corp.;   

2.  
     
       Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
      necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
      which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
      covered by this report;   

3.  
     
       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and
      other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
      material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
      flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
      report;   

4.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
      responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
      procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
      Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and
  have:     

a.  
     
       Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
      caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
      supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
      registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
      by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which
      this report is being prepared;   

b.  
     
       Designed such internal control over financial reporting,
      or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
      under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
      statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles;   

c.  
     
       Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's
      disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our
      conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
      procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
      such evaluation; and   

d.  
     
       Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
      internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
      registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
      quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
      is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
      control over financial reporting; and     

5.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
      disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
      financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
      of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
      equivalent functions):     

a.  
     
       All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
      the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
      are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
      record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

b.  
     
       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
      management or other employees who have a significant role in the
      registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.
