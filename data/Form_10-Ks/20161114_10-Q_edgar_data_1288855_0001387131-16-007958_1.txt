        General.    OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. (the  Holding Company ) is a one-bank holding company and owns 100% of OptimumBank (the  Bank ), a Florida-chartered commercial bank. The Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries are OB Real Estate Management, LLC and OB Real Estate Holdings, LLC, both of which were formed in 2009; OB Real Estate Holdings 1692 and OB Real Estate Holdings 1704 formed in 2012, collectively, (the  Real Estate Holding Subsidiaries ). The Holding Company s only business is the operation of the Bank and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ). The Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Bank offers a variety of community banking services to individual and corporate customers through its three banking offices located in Broward County, Florida. OB Real Estate Management, LLC is primarily engaged in managing foreclosed real estate. This subsidiary had no activity in 2016 and 2015. All other subsidiaries are primarily engaged in holding and disposing of foreclosed real estate.   

In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company contain all adjustments (consisting principally of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2016, the results of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.   

Going Concern Status .  The Company is in default with respect to its $5,155,000 Junior Subordinated Debenture ( Debenture ) due to its failure to make certain required interest payments under the Debenture. The Trustee of the Debenture (the  Trustee ) or the holders of the Debenture are entitled to accelerate the payment of the $5,155,000 principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest totaling $1,095,700 at September 30, 2016. No adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been made as a result of this uncertainty. Management s plans with regard to this matter are as follows: A Director of the Company has offered to purchase the Debenture and this offer has been approved by certain equity owners of the Trust that holds the Debenture. The Director has also agreed to enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company with respect to payments due under the Debenture upon consummation of the Director s purchase of the Debenture. Although the Director tendered the purchase price for the Debenture in 2014, the Trustee has received conflicting directions and therefore on December 11, 2014, the Trustee commenced an Action for Interpleader in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Interpleader Action ). On August 31, 2015, the court held that the Trustee could not sell the Debenture to the Director because certain conditions and requirements set forth in the indenture for the Trust had not been fulfilled. The Director has continued his efforts to acquire the Debenture. To date the Trustee has not accelerated the outstanding balance of the Debenture.    

In March of 2016, the Trustee received a direction from certain equity owners of the Trust that hold the Debenture to Sell the Debenture to a Director of the Company. Based upon the receipt of other conflicting directions, on August 26, 2016, the Trustee commenced an action in a Minnesota State Court seeking directions from the Court. On September 14, 2016, a Notice of Removal was filed and the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On October 10, 2016, the Trustee and the various Interested Parties filed a Stipulation to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Stipulation ). Based upon the Stipulation, on October 13, 2016, the Minnesota Federal Court entered its Order to Transfer Venue of the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties are seeking to have this matter assigned to the same District Court Judge who was assigned the Interpleader Action. To date no scheduling order has been entered. The Company continues to pursue mechanisms for paying the accrued interest, such as raising additional capital.   

Comprehensive (Loss) Income.   Generally accepted accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net earnings (loss). Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, such items along with net earnings (loss), are components of comprehensive (loss) earnings. The only component of other comprehensive (loss) income is the net change in the unrealized (loss) gain on the securities available for sale.   

Income Taxes.   The Company assessed its earnings history and trends and estimates of future earnings, and determined that the deferred tax asset could not be realized as of September 30, 2016. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against the net deferred tax asset.

        General, Continued.      

Recent Pronouncements.   In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which is intended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The ASU requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net earnings, simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identity impairment and eliminates the requirement to disclose fair values, the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The ASU also clarifies that the Company should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for-sale debt securities in combination with the Company s other deferred tax assets. These amendments are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2,  Leases (Topic 842)  which will require lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with term of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.  The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.  Early application will be permitted.   

In June 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) .  The ASU improves financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by the Company. The ASU requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. The Company will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The ASU will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.   

Reclassification.   Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 financial statement presentation.   

Recent Regulatory Developments.   
        Basel III Rules.  On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ) approved the final rules implementing
        the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks. Under the final rules, minimum requirements
        will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital
        to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The
        final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% and require a minimum leverage
        ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. On July 9, 2013,
        the FDIC also approved, as an interim final rule, the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banks, following the actions of
        the FRB. The FDIC s rule is identical in substance to the final rules issued by the FRB. 
           
         The phase-in period for the
        final rules began for the Bank on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased
        in over a multi-year schedule. The provisions of the final rules are not expected to have a material impact on the Bank.

        Securities, Continued.    At September 30, 2016, the unrealized losses on eight investment securities were caused by market conditions. It is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the book value of the investments. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to market conditions and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or maturity, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired.   

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. A security is impaired if the fair value is less than its carrying value at the financial statement date. When a security is impaired, the Company determines whether this impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses, management assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in operations. For securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment recognized in operations is limited to the amount related to credit losses, while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Management utilizes cash flow models to segregate impairments to distinguish between impairment related to credit losses and impairment related to other factors. To assess for OTTI, management considers, among other things, (i) the severity and duration of the impairment; (ii) the ratings of the security; (iii) the overall transaction structure (the Company s position within the structure, the aggregate, near-term financial performance of the underlying collateral, delinquencies, defaults, loss severities, recoveries, prepayments, cumulative loss projections, and discounted cash flows); and (iv) the timing and magnitude of a break in modeled cash flows.   

In evaluating securities with unrealized
        losses, management utilizes various resources, including input from independent third-party firms to perform an analysis of expected
        future cash flows. The process begins with an assessment of the underlying collateral backing the mortgage pools. Management develops
        specific assumptions using as much market data as possible and includes internal estimates as well as estimates published by rating
        agencies and other third-party sources. The data for the individual borrowers in the underlying mortgage pools are generally segregated
        by state, FICO score at issue, loan to value at issue, and income documentation criteria. Mortgage pools are evaluated for current
        and expected levels of delinquencies and foreclosures, based on where they fall in the prescribed data set of FICO score, locations,
        LTV and documentation type, and a level of loss severity is assigned to each security based on its experience. The above-described
        historical data is used to develop current and expected measures of cumulative default rates as well as ultimate loss frequency
        and severity within the underlying mortgages. This reveals the expected future cash flows within the mortgage pool. The data described
        above is then input to an industry recognized model to assess the behavior of the particular security tranche owned by the Company.
        Significant inputs in this process include the structure of any subordination structures, if applicable, and are dictated by the
        structure of each particular security as laid out in the offering documents. The forecasted cash flows from the mortgage pools
        are input through the security structuring model to derive expected cash flows for the specific security owned by the Company to
        determine if the future cash flows are expected to exceed the book value of the security. The values for the significant inputs
        are updated on a regular basis. 
           
         The Company did not record any
OTTI losses for securities available for sale.

        Loans, Continued. Residential Real Estate, Multi-Family Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Land and Construction.   All loans are underwritten in accordance with policies set forth and approved by the Board of Directors (the  Board ), including repayment capacity and source, value of the underlying property, credit history and stability. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans are secured by the subject property and are underwritten based upon standards set forth in the policies approved by the Company s Board. Such standards include, among other factors, loan to value limits, cash flow coverage and general creditworthiness of the obligors. Construction loans to borrowers finance the construction of owner occupied and leased properties. These loans are categorized as construction loans during the construction period, later converting to commercial or residential real estate loans after the construction is complete and amortization of the loan begins. Real estate development and construction loans are approved based on an analysis of the borrower and guarantor, the viability of the project and on an acceptable percentage of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Real estate development and construction loan funds are disbursed periodically based on the percentage of construction completed. The Company carefully monitors these loans with on-site inspections and requires the receipt of lien waivers on funds advanced. Development and construction loans are typically secured by the properties under development or construction, and personal guarantees are typically obtained. Further, to assure that reliance is not placed solely on the value of the underlying property, the Company considers the market conditions and feasibility of proposed projects, the financial condition and reputation of the borrower and guarantors, the amount of the borrower s equity in the project, independent appraisals, cost estimates and pre-construction sales information. The Company also makes loans on occasion for the purchase of land for future development by the borrower. Land loans are extended for future development for either commercial or residential use by the borrower. The Company carefully analyzes the intended use of the property and the viability thereof.   

Commercial.   Commercial business loans and lines of credit consist of loans to small- and medium-sized companies in the Company s market area. Commercial loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. Primarily all of the Company s commercial loans are secured loans, along with a small amount of unsecured loans. The Company s underwriting analysis consists of a review of the financial statements of the borrower, the lending history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the value of the collateral, if any, and whether the loan is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. These loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business, which makes them of higher risk than residential loans and the collateral securing loans may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards.   

Consumer.   Consumer loans are extended for various purposes, including purchases of automobiles, recreational vehicles, and boats. Also offered are home improvement loans, lines of credit, personal loans, and deposit account collateralized loans. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Loans to consumers are extended after a credit evaluation, including the creditworthiness of the borrower(s), the purpose of the credit, and the secondary source of repayment. Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts.

       Loans, Continued.   The following summarizes the loan credit quality (in thousands):  

Pass   a Pass loan s primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory, with secondary sources very likely to be realized if necessary. These are loans that conform in all aspects to bank policy and regulatory requirements, and no repayment risk has been identified.  

OLEM (Other Loans Especially Mentioned)   an Other Loan Especially Mentioned has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Company s credit position at some future date.   

Substandard   a Substandard loan is
    inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
    Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Included
    in this category are loans that are current on their payments, but the Bank is unable to document the source of repayment.
    They are     characterized     by     the     distinct     possibility     that     the     Company     will     sustain
    some     loss     if     the     deficiencies are     not     corrected.  

Doubtful   a loan classified as Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified as Substandard, with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. The Company charges off any loan classified as Doubtful.  

Loss   a loan classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. The Company fully charges off any loan classified as Loss.

At September 30, 2016, the Bank is well-capitalized. As a result of the Consent Order discussed in Note 9, the Bank cannot be categorized higher than  adequately capitalized  until the Consent Order is lifted, even if its ratios were to exceed those required to be a  well capitalized  bank.

        Stock-Based Compensation.    On December 27, 2011, the Company s stockholders approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2011 Plan ). In May 2016, the Company increased the total number of shares available to be awarded from 105,000 shares (adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split) to 210,000 shares. Options, restricted stock, performance share awards and bonus share awards in lieu of obligations may be issued under the 2011 Plan. Both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options can be granted under the 2011 Plan. The exercise price of the stock options cannot be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options must be exercised within ten years of the date of grant.    

As of September 30, 2016, only common stock has been issued as compensation to directors for services rendered under this plan. 7,559 and 25,112 shares of common stock (adjusted for one-for-ten reverse stock split) were issued for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A total of $32,000 and $229,000 of compensation was recorded during the 2016 and 2015 periods. At September 30, 2016 a total of 149,482 (adjusted for one-for-ten reverse stock split) shares remain available for grant.

(9)   
        Regulatory Matters.   The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the bank regulatory agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company and Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.   

Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank, became subject to the new Basel III capital level threshold requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations with full compliance with all of the final rule s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. These new regulations were designed to ensure that banks maintain strong capital positions even in the event of severe economic downturns or unforeseen losses.   

Changes that could affect the Bank going forward include additional constraints on the inclusion of deferred tax assets in capital and increased risk weightings for nonperforming loans and acquisition/development loans in regulatory capital. Under the new regulations in the first quarter of 2015, the Bank elected an irreversible one-time opt-out to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from regulatory capital.

        Corporation and the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation ( OFR ), and accordingly is deemed to be  adequately
        capitalized  even if its capital ratios were to exceed those generally required to be a  well capitalized  bank.

Regulatory Enforcement Actions    

Bank Consent Order. On April 16, 2010, the Bank
agreed to the issuance of the Consent Order by the FDIC and the OFR (the  Original Consent Order ), which was amended
on February 28, 2014. Under the Original Consent Order, the Bank was required to take certain measures to improve its capital position,
reduce its level of problem assets, reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios, improve management practices and board
supervision and assure that its reserve for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level. The Original Consent Order required
the Bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12%. At September 30, 2016,
the Bank had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.78%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.37%.   

See Footnote 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K for additional information concerning the requirements of the Original
Consent Order.   

During  the second quarter of 2016, the Bank was
notified by the FDIC and the OFR that the Bank had not complied with certain of the terms of the Original Consent Order, and that
the Bank continues to exhibit weaknesses in its level of capital, loan quality, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risks.
The FDIC and OFR also noted issues related to the management of the Bank, including issues with capital adequacy, risk management,
loan concentrations, operating deficits, compliance with the Original Consent Order, weaknesses in the Bank s customer related
due diligence, insider conflicts of interest and regulatory compliance.

(Unaudited)  

On November 2, 2016, at the request of the FDIC and the OFR, the Bank agreed to the entry of a new Consent Order to be issued
    by the FDIC and the OFR (the  New Order ). The New Order will become effective when issued by the FDIC and the
    OFR.   

The New Order addresses many of
    the issues addressed in the Original Consent Order, as well as issues related to board supervision and composition,
    management composition, asset quality, lending practices, allowance for loan losses, asset growth, and compliance with the
    Bank Secrecy act and related regulations. The New Order will continue to restrict the ability of the Bank to pay
    dividends.  

Management believes that the Bank has made substantial
progress in improving its financial condition through a significant reduction in non-performing assets and the receipt of capital
increases from investors since the date of the Original Consent Order. The Bank is also seeking to address the other issues raised
by the FDIC and the OFR, although the Bank has been hampered by difficulties in raising capital due to the default under the Debenture
and the limits placed on the Company and the Bank under the Original Consent Order and the Written Agreement. Management intends
to continue its efforts to meet the conditions of the New Consent Order and the Written Agreement.   

Company Written Agreement with Reserve Bank. On
June 22, 2010, the Company and the Reserve Bank entered into a Written Agreement with respect to certain aspects of the operation
and management of the Company The Written Agreement prohibits, without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank, the payment of
dividends, taking dividends or payments from the Bank, making any interest, principal or other distributions on trust preferred
securities (including the Debenture), incurring, increasing or guaranteeing any debt, purchasing or redeeming any shares of stock,
or appointing any new director or senior executive officer. Management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the Written Agreement.   

(10)   
        Junior Subordinated Debenture.    On September 30, 2004, the Company issued a $5,155,000 junior subordinated debenture to an unconsolidated subsidiary (the  Debenture ). The Debenture has a term of thirty years. The interest rate was fixed at 6.4% for the first five years, and thereafter, the coupon rate floats quarterly at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 2.45% (3.13% at September 30, 2016). The Debenture is redeemable in certain circumstances. The terms of the Debenture allow the Company to defer payments of interest on the Debenture by extending the interest payment period at any time during the term of the Debenture for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. Beginning in 2010, the Company exercised its right to defer payment of interest on the Debenture. Interest payments deferred as of September 30, 2016 totaled $1,095,700. The Company has deferred interest payments with respect to the Debenture for the maximum allowable twenty consecutive quarterly payments. The holder of the Debenture can accelerate the $5,155,000 principal balance as a result of this default. Under the Written Agreement, the Company is not able to make these interest payments without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Regulatory approval to pay accrued and unpaid interest has been denied.   

A Director of the Company has offered to purchase the Debenture and this offer has been approved by certain equity owners of the Trust that holds the Debenture. The Director has also agreed to enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company with respect to payments due under the Debenture upon consummation of the Director s purchase of the debenture. Although the Director tendered the purchase price for the Debenture in 2014, the Trustee has received conflicting directions and therefore on December 11, 2014, the Trustee commenced an Action for Interpleader in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 31, 2015, the court held that the Trustee could not sell the Debenture to the Director because certain conditions and requirements set forth in the indenture for the Trust had not been fulfilled. The Director has continued his efforts to acquire the Debenture.  To date the Trustee has not accelerated the outstanding balance of the debenture.    

In March of 2016, the Trustee received a direction from certain equity owners of the Trust that hold the Debenture to Sell the Debenture to a Director of the Company. Based upon the receipt of other conflicting directions, on August 26, 2016, the Trustee commenced an action in a Minnesota State Court seeking directions from the Court. On September 14, 2016, a Notice of Removal was filed and the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On October 10, 2016, the Trustee and the various Interested Parties filed a Stipulation to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Stipulation ). Based upon the Stipulation, on October 13, 2016, the Minnesota Federal Court entered its Order to Transfer Venue of the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties are seeking to have this matter assigned to the same District Court Judge who was assigned the Interpleader Action. To date no schedule order has been entered. The Company continues to pursue mechanisms for paying the accrued interest, such as raising additional capital.   

(11)   
        Reverse Common Stock Split.    Effective January 11, 2016 each ten shares of the Company s common stock were converted into one share of common stock. Earnings (loss) per share for 2016 and 2015 has been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse common stock split.   

(12)   
        Loan Loss Recovery.    On January 6, 2016, the Bank completed a sale of judgement on a defaulted credit that resulted in a $1.8 million recovery of previously charged-off amounts to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ( ALLL ). This increases the balance of the ALLL to approximately $4.2 million. On February 12, 2016, and amended May 6, 2016, pursuant to the terms and requirements of the Consent Order, Management submitted a written request to the FDIC for a partial reversal of the ALLL. As of this date, no response from the FDIC has been received and management does not expect a response until the next safety and soundness examination which is expected to be performed in first and second quarters of 2017.   

(13)   
        Reclassification.    During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company agreed to issue 46,296 shares to the Bank s Chairman
as compensation. The Company recorded compensation expense of $200,000 based on the fair market value of the shares at that time,
and reflected the issuance of the shares as an increase in stockholders  equity. The Bank s Chairman has not yet taken
delivery of the shares. As a result, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined to reclassify the transaction
as a liability of the Company (rather than an increase in stockholders  equity) until the issuance of the shares. The reclassification
had no effect on the Company s net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 or the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

Capital Levels  

Quantitative measures established by regulation
and by the Consent Order to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following
table) of Total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average assets. As of September 30, 2016, the
Bank met the minimum applicable capital adequacy requirements for Total Capital to Risk   Weighted Assets, but did not meet
the requirement for Tier I Capital to Total Assets.

Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015  

Overview  

The Bank s total assets decreased
by $5.8 million to $121.7 million at September 30, 2016, from $127.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to a reduction
in total loans and total deposits. Total stockholders  equity increased approximately $350,000 at September 30, 2016 from
$2,967,000 at December 31, 2015 to $3,317,000. The increase was due to an unrealized OCI gain of $48,000, the issuance of $32,000
of common stock as compensation to directors, the issuance of $128,000 of common stock for services, and the sale of $450,000 in
common and preferred stock to investors, which offset the net loss of $308,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The following table shows selected information
for the periods ended or at the dates indicated:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, (Continued)  

Liquidity and Sources of Funds   

The Bank s sources of funds
include customer deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ( FHLB ), principal repayments and sales
of investment securities, loan repayments, foreclosed real estate sales, the use of Federal Funds markets, net earnings, if any,
and loans taken out at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. 

Deposits are our primary source
of funds. In order to increase its core deposits, the Bank has priced its deposit rates competitively. The Bank will adjust rates
on its deposits to attract or retain deposits as needed. Under the Consent Order, the interest rate that the Bank pays on its market
area deposits is restricted. It is possible that the Bank could experience a decrease in deposit inflows, or the migration of current
deposits to competitor institutions, if other institutions offer higher interest rates than those permitted to be offered by the
Bank. Despite these yield limitations, we believe that we have the ability to adjust rates on our deposits to attract or retain
deposits as needed. 

In addition to obtaining funds
from depositors, we may borrow funds from other financial institutions. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had outstanding borrowings
of $20,500,000, against its $31,700,000 in established borrowing capacity with the FHLB. The Bank s borrowing facility is
subject to collateral and stock ownership requirements, as well as prior FHLB consent to each advance. In 2010, the Bank obtained
an available discount window credit line with the Federal Reserve Bank, currently $788,200. The Federal Reserve Bank line is subject
to collateral requirements and must be repaid within 90 days; each advance is subject to prior Federal Reserve Bank consent. The
Bank also has a $2.5 million line of credit with SunTrust, $750,000 line of credit with Servis First Bank and a $2,500,000 line
of credit with AloStar Bank. We measure and monitor our liquidity daily and believe our liquidity sources are adequate to meet
our operating needs. 

In the past, the Company, on an
unconsolidated basis, relied on dividends from the Bank to fund its operating expenses, primarily expenses of being publicly held,
and to make interest payments on the Company s junior subordinated debenture (the  Debenture ). Under the Consent
Order, the Bank is currently unable to pay dividends to the Company without prior regulatory approval. Additionally, under the
Written Agreement, the Company may not pay interest payments on the Debenture or dividends on the Company s common stock,
incur any additional indebtedness at the Company level, or redeem the Company s common stock without the prior regulatory
approval of the Federal Reserve Bank. Since January 2010, the Company has deferred interest payments on the Debenture, which has
been in default since 2015. See  Junior Subordinated Debenture  below. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company is a party to financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial
instruments are commitments to extend credit and may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in
excess of the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect
the extent of the Company s involvement in these financial instruments. 

Commitments to extend credit are
agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total committed amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company
evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. 

The amount of collateral obtained,
if it is deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counter
party. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had commitments to extend credit totaling $1.2 million.

offered to purchase the Debenture and this offer has been approved by certain equity owners of the Trust that holds the Debenture.
The Director has also agreed to enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company with respect to payments due under the Debenture
upon consummation of the Director s purchase of the debenture. Although the Director tendered the purchase price for the
Debenture in 2014, the Trustee has received conflicting directions and therefore on December 11, 2014, the Trustee commenced an
Action for Interpleader in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 31, 2015, the court
held that the Trustee could not sell the Debenture to the Director because certain conditions and requirements set forth in the
indenture for the Trust had not been fulfilled. The Director has continued his efforts to acquire the Debenture. To date, the Trustee
has not accelerated the outstanding balance of the debenture. 

In March of 2016, the Trustee
received a direction from certain equity owners of the Trust that hold the Debenture to Sell the Debenture to a Director of the
Company. Based upon the receipt of other conflicting directions, on August 26, 2016, the Trustee commenced an action in a Minnesota
State Court seeking directions from the court. On September 14, 2016, a Notice of removal was filed and the case was removed to
the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On October 10, 2016, the Trustee and the various Interested Parties
filed a Stipulation to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Stipulation ).
Based upon the Stipulation, on October 13, 2016, the Minnesota Federal Court entered its Order to Transfer Venue of the case to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties are seeking to have this matter assigned to
the same District Court Judge who was assigned the Interpleader Action. To date no schedule order has been entered. The Company
continues to pursue mechanisms for paying the accrued interest, such as raising additional capital. 

In the event the amounts due
under the Debenture were accelerated, then the Trustee could undertake legal proceedings to obtain a judgment against the Company
with respect to such amounts due under the Debenture. If this action were successful, then the Trustee could seek to affect a sale
of the Bank to pay the amounts due under the Debenture.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, (Continued)  

Comparison of the Three-Month Periods
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

General.
  Net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $22,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share compared to
net earnings of $46,000 or $0.05 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in net
earnings was due to a combination of higher loan interest income, lower non-interest income and lower expenses associated with
foreclosed real estate. During September 30, 2015, the bank recognized a reversal of previously recorded income tax expense. 

Interest
Income.   Interest income increased to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to an increase in interest earnings assets. 

Interest
Expense.   Interest expense increased to $272,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $222,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, due to higher interest paid on deposits and an increase in borrowing during 2016. 

Provision
for Loan Losses.   There was no provision for the three months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. The provision
for loan losses is charged to operations in order to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by
management to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
is based upon historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by us, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s
ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, loans identified as impaired, general economic conditions, particularly
as they relate to our market areas, and other factors related to the estimated collectability of our loan portfolio. The allowance
for loan losses totaled $4.2 million or 4.91% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.3 million, or 2.71% of
loans outstanding at September 30, 2015. See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Noninterest
Income.   Total noninterest income decreased to $31,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $172,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to nonrecurring loan fees recognized in 2015. 

Noninterest
Expenses.   Total noninterest expenses decreased to $960,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of lower expenses on foreclosed real estate. 

Income
Tax Benefit.   The income tax benefit resulted from the favorable settlement of a dispute with the IRS related to certain
of the Company s Federal income tax returns. 

Comparison of the Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015  

General.
  Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $(308,000) or $(0.30) loss per basic and diluted share compared
to a net loss of $(130,000) or $(.12) loss per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in net loss was due to a combination of higher interest income, lower non-interest income and lower expenses associated with foreclosed
real estate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the bank recognized a reversal of previously recorded income tax
expense. 

Interest
Income.   Interest income increased to $3,599,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,341,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in interest earnings assets. 

Interest
Expense.   Interest expense on deposits and borrowings increased to $810,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
from $655,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher interest paid on
deposits and borrowing during 2016. 

Provision
for Loan Losses.   There was no provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The provision for loan losses
is charged to operations in order to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb
losses inherent in the portfolio. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon historical
experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by us, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to
repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, loans identified as impaired, general economic conditions, particularly as
they relate to our market areas, and other factors related to the estimated collectability of our loan portfolio. The allowance
for loan losses totaled $4.2 million or 4.91% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.3 million, or 2.71% of
loans outstanding at September 30, 2015. See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, (Continued)  

Noninterest
Income.   Total noninterest income decreased to $125,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $372,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to nonrecurring loan fees recognized in 2015. 

Noninterest
Expenses.   Total noninterest expenses decreased to $3,221,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,508,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to reduction in expenses for foreclosed real estate.   

Income
Tax Benefit.   The income tax benefit resulted from the favorable settlement of a dispute with the IRS related to certain
of the Company s Federal income tax returns. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

The Company s management evaluated
the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and, based on this
evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
are effective. 

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER
INFORMATION  

Item 2. Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

Non-Employee Director Share Issuances   

On September 30, 2016, the Company agreed
to issue 2,206 shares of its common stock to the Company s non-employee directors under the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive
Plan and the Company s Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan (the  Director Compensation Plan ) for attendance
fees at board meetings of the Company during the third quarter of 2016. Under the Director Compensation Plan, which became effective
on January 1, 2012, fees for attendance at board and committee meetings are payable 75% in shares of common stock and 25% in cash
on a quarterly basis. The shares were issued at the price of $4.75, the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance.
The issuance of the shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer
not involving a public offering. 

Other Significant Share Issuance  

During the quarter ended June 30, 2016,
the Company agreed to issue 92,980 shares to an individual investor at the price of $4.04 per share, the fair market value of the
shares agreed upon for the purchase. The issuance of the shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2016,
the Company agreed to issue 36,118 shares as compensation for legal services at the price of $3.53 per share, at 85% of the 30-day
weighted average market price of the shares on the date of issuance. The issuance of the shares was exempt from registration pursuant
to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. 

Item 3. Defaults on Senior Securities  

Junior Subordinated Debenture  

On September 30, 2004, the Company issued
a $5,155,000 junior subordinated debenture to an unconsolidated subsidiary (the  Debenture ). The Debenture has a term
of thirty years. The interest rate was fixed at 6.4% for the first five years, and thereafter, the coupon rate floats quarterly
at the three-month LIBOR rate plus 2.45% (3.13% at September 30, 2016). The Debenture is redeemable in certain circumstances. The
terms of the Debenture allow the Company to defer payments of interest on the Debenture by extending the interest payment period
at any time during the term of the Debenture for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. Beginning in 2010, the Company exercised
its right to defer payment of interest on the Debenture. Interest payments deferred as of September 30, 2016 totaled $1,095,700.
The Company has deferred interest payments with respect to the Debenture for the maximum allowable twenty consecutive quarterly
payments. The holder of the Debenture can accelerate the $5,155,000 principal balance as a result of this default. Under the Written
Agreement, the Company is not able to make these interest payments without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Regulatory approval to pay accrued and unpaid interest has been denied. 

A Director of the Company has offered to
purchase the Debenture and this offer has been approved by certain equity owners of the Trust that holds the Debenture. The Director
has also agreed to enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company with respect to payments due under the Debenture upon consummation
of the Director s purchase of the debenture. Although the Director tendered the purchase price for the Debenture in 2014,
the Trustee has received conflicting directions and therefore on December 11, 2014, the Trustee commenced an Action for Interpleader
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On August 31, 2015, the court held that the Trustee
could not sell the Debenture to the Director because certain conditions and requirements set forth in the indenture for the Trust
had not been fulfilled. The Director has continued his efforts to acquire the Debenture. To date, the Trustee has not accelerated
the outstanding balance of the debenture. 

In March of 2016, the Trustee received
a direction from certain equity owners of the Trust that hold the Debenture to Sell the Debenture to a Director of the Company.
Based upon the receipt of other conflicting directions, on August 26, 2016, the Trustee commenced an action in a Minnesota State
Court seeking directions from the court. On September 14, 2016, a Notice of removal was filed and the case was removed to the United
States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On October 10, 2016, the Trustee and the various Interested Parties filed
a Stipulation to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Stipulation ).
Based upon the Stipulation, on October 13, 2016, the Minnesota Federal Court entered its Order to Transfer Venue of the case to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The parties are seeking to have this matter assigned to
the same District Court Judge who was assigned the Interpleader Action. To date no schedule order has been entered. The Company
continues to pursue mechanisms for paying the accrued interest, such as raising additional capital. 

In the event the amounts due under the
Debenture were accelerated, then the Trustee could undertake legal proceedings to obtain a judgment against the Company with respect
to such amounts due under the Debenture. If this action were successful, then the Trustee could seek to affect a sale of the Bank
to pay the amounts due under the Debenture.
