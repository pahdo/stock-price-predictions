1   Organization and Operations   

Wizard
World, Inc.     

Wizard
World, Inc., formerly GoEnergy, Inc. ( Wizard World  or the  Company ) was incorporated on May 2, 2001,
under the laws of the State of Delaware. We, through our operating subsidiary, are a producer of pop culture and live multimedia
conventions across North America.  

Kick
the Can Corp.    

Kick
The Can Corp. was incorporated on September 20, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada.  

Kicking
the Can, L.L.C.    

Kicking
The Can, L.L.C. was formed on April 17, 2009, under the laws of the State of Delaware.  

Acquisition
of Kick the Can Corp. / Wizard Conventions, Inc. Recognized as a Reverse Acquisition    

On
December 7, 2010, the Company entered into and consummated a share exchange agreement ( Share Exchange Agreement )
with successor, Kick the Can Corp. ( KTC Corp. ) and its predecessors Wizard Conventions, Inc. and Kicking The Can,
L.L.C. (collectively,  Conventions ). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 32,927,596 shares of
its common stock to the KTC Corp. shareholders in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of KTC Corp. The shares
issued represented approximately 94.9% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately after the consummation of the Share
Exchange Agreement.  

As
a result of the controlling financial interest of the former stockholder of Conventions, for financial statement reporting purposes,
the merger between the Company and Conventions has been treated as a reverse acquisition with KTC Corp. deemed the accounting
acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with section
805-10-55 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification. The reverse merger
is deemed a capital transaction and the net assets of KTC Corp. (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to the Company (the
legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying value before the combination. The acquisition process utilizes the
capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of KTC Corp. which are recorded at historical cost. The equity
of the Company is the historical equity of KTC Corp. retroactively restated to reflect the number of shares issued by the Company
in the transaction. Because of the predecessor/successor relationship between the Company and KTC Corp., Conventions ultimately
became the accounting acquirer.  

Wizard
World Digital, Inc.    

On
March 18, 2011, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary called Wizard World Digital, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( Digital ).
Digital never commenced operations or has employees, and Digital is currently dormant, pending execution of a digital strategy.  

Wiz
Wizard, LLC    

On
December 29, 2014, the Company and a member of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) of the Company formed Wiz Wizard,
LLC ( Wiz Wizard ) under the law of the State of Delaware. The Company and the member of the Board each owned 50%
of the membership interest and agreed to allocate the profits and losses accordingly upon repayment of the initial capital contributions
on a pro rata basis. The Company consolidates its 50% equity interest and reports the remaining 50% equity interest owned by a
member of the Board as the non-controlling interest in Wiz Wizard as the management of the Company believes that the Company has
the control of Wiz Wizard. In addition, the Company and Wiz Wizard, launched ComicConBox ( ConBox ) in April 2015.
ConBox is a subscription-based premium monthly box service featuring collectibles, exclusives, toys, tech and gaming, licensed
artwork, superior comics and apparel, Comic Convention tickets, special VIP discounts and more, which will be shipped on or around
the end of every month. The Company plans to continue to partner with major Comic Convention related brands and celebrities to
deliver a high quality and variation of products directly to the front doors of its subscribers. On February 4, 2016, the member
of the Board assigned his fifty percent (50%) membership interest to the Company. Consequently, Wiz Wizard is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company.  

ButtaFyngas
LLC    

On
April 10, 2015, the Company and an unrelated third party formed ButtaFyngas, LLC ( ButtaFyngas ) under the law of
the State of Delaware. The Company and the unrelated party each own 50% of the membership interest and shall allocate the profits
and losses accordingly upon repayment of the initial capital contributions on a pro rata basis. The Company consolidates its 50%
equity interest and reports the remaining 50% equity interest owned by the third party as the non-controlling interest in ButtaFyngas.  

Note 2 - Liquidity and Management
Plans  

As reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net income and net cash used in operations of $749,885 and ($1,245,272),
respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital of $2,543,922
and an accumulated deficit of $15,263,411. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,188,406.
The Company estimates the cash and cash equivalents currently on hand as of November 21, 2016 is insufficient to fund its operations
on a long term basis past December 31, 2016. In order to fund operations past that date is dependent on management s plans,
which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing
sources, including term notes, or the significant reduction of operating expenses until such time that funds provided by operations
are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no assurance that the Company s projections and estimates
are accurate. The Company is actively managing and controlling the Company s cash outflows to mitigate these risks. 

Note
3   Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices   

The
management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and their application. Critical
accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition
and results and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to
make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company s significant and critical accounting
policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.  

Basis
of Presentation - Unaudited Interim Financial Information    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) with
respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of
the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the entities as of the reporting period ending dates and for
the reporting periods as follows:  

All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. Non controlling interest represents the minority equity investment
in the Company s subsidiaries, plus the minority investors  share of the net operating results and other components
of equity relating to the non controlling interest.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the aggregate non-controlling interest in ButtaFyngas was ($10,842). As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate
non-controlling interest in Wiz Wizard and ButtaFyngas was $17,706. The non-controlling interest is separately disclosed on the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Investments
- Cost Method, Equity Method and Joint Venture    

In
accordance with sub-topic 323-10 of the FASB ASC ( Sub-topic 323-10 ), the Company accounts for investments in common
stock of an investee for which the Company has significant influence in the operating or financial policies even though the Company
holds 50% or less of the common stock or in-substance common stock.  

Method
of Accounting    

Investments
held in stock of entities other than subsidiaries, namely corporate joint ventures and other non-controlled entities usually are
accounted for by one of three methods: (i) the fair value method (addressed in Topic 320), (ii) the equity method (addressed in
Topic 323), or (iii) the cost method (addressed in Subtopic 325-20). Pursuant to Paragraph 323-10-05-5, the equity method tends
to be most appropriate if an investment enables the investor to influence the operating or financial policies of the investee.  

Investment
in CONtv    

On
August 27, 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture and executed an Operating Agreement for CON TV LLC ( CONtv )
with Cinedigm Entertainment Corp. ( Cinedigm ), ROAR, LLC (a related party partially owned by a member of the Board)
( ROAR ) and Bristol Capital, LLC (a related party controlled by a member of the Board) ( Bristol Capital ).
The Company owned a 47.50% interest in the newly formed entity, CONtv. The Company was accounting for the interest in the joint
venture utilizing the equity method of accounting.  

On
November 16, 2015, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Operating Agreement for CONtv by and among the aforementioned
parties (the  A R Operating Agreement ), the Company s ownership interest in CONtv was reduced to 10%. Pursuant
to the A R Operating Agreement, the Company is only obligated to fund on-going costs in the amount of $25,000 in cash on an
on-going monthly basis for a period of 12 months following the effective date.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $75,000 and $148,089 in losses from this venture, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $225,000 and $1,046,525 in losses from this venture,
respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the investment in CONtv was $0.  

Revenue
Recognition and Cost of Revenues    

The
Company follows Paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

Unearned
convention revenue is deposits received for conventions that have not yet taken place, which are fully or partially refundable
depending upon the terms and conditions of the agreements.  

Unearned
ConBox revenue is non-refundable up-front payments for products. These payments are initially deferred and subsequently recognized
over the subscription period, typically three months, and upon shipment of the product.  

The
Company recognizes cost of revenues in the period in which the revenues was earned. In the event the Company incurs cost of revenues
for conventions that are yet to occur, the Company records such amounts as prepaid expenses and such prepaid expenses are expensed
during the period the convention takes place.  

Earnings
Per Share    

Earnings
per share ( EPS ) is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term
is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to Section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16, basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the
period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred
stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned)
from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect
the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options
or warrants.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23, diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate
or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and
their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method
unless the provisions of Paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied.
Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid
stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260 10 55 23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and
purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: (a.) exercise of options and warrants
shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued,
(b.) the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
(See Paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.), and (c.) the incremental shares (the difference between the number
of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  

The
following table shows the outstanding dilutive common shares excluded from the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation
as they were anti-dilutive:  

The
computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to common stockholders are as follows:  

(a)
- Weighted-average common shares outstanding.  

The
Company s contingent share issuance arrangements, stock options and warrants are as follows:  

Income
Taxes    

In
the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax positions. The Company assesses its income
tax positions and records tax assets or liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation
of the facts and circumstances and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not
that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those
income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized
in the financial statements. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income
tax expense or benefit.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company partially utilized NOL carry-forwards to offset taxable income.  

Subsequent
Events    

The
Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers
its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
July 2015, the FASB issued the ASU No. 2015-11   Inventory (Topic 330) :  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 
 ( ASU 2015-11 ) .  The amendments in this ASU do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out
(LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured
using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this ASU at the lower
of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured
using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the
effects of ASU 2015-11 on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required
to recognize, for all leases of 12 months or more, a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the
right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of
financial statements better understand the nature of an entity s leasing activities. This ASU is effective for public reporting
companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted
using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its condensed
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing   (topic 606). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross verses Net)   (topic 606). These amendments provide additional
clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance
obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs; and determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides
a customer with either a right to use an entity s intellectual property or a right to access an entity s intellectual property.
The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal versus agent
evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU
2016-08 is to coincide with an entity s adoption of ASU 2014-09, which we intend to adopt for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   (topic 718). The FASB
issued this update to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified,
including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the new standard.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients  , which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash
consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by Wizard World, Inc. (the  Company ) from time to time with
the SEC (collectively, the  Filings ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based
upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made
by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are
only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate,   believe, 
 estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative
of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking
statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties,
assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry, and the Company s
operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended,
or planned.  

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.  

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

We
intend for this discussion to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain
key items in those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting
principles affect our financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying
notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, included elsewhere in this report.  

We are a producer of pop culture and multimedia
conventions ( Comic Conventions ) across North America that market movies, TV shows, video games, technology,
toys, social networking/gaming platforms, comic books and graphic novels. These Comic Conventions provide sales, marketing,
promotions, public relations, advertising and sponsorship opportunities for entertainment companies, toy companies, gaming companies,
publishing companies, marketers, corporate sponsors, and retailers. 

Plan
of Operation   

Our Company has two lines of business: (i)
live multimedia events, which involve admissions and exhibitor booth space, and (ii) ConBox. Our current focus is two-fold and
includes both growing our existing Comic Conventions by obtaining new exhibitors and dealers and attracting more high profile
celebrities and VIPs, and identifying new markets in which to produce additional Comic Conventions. We also plan to expose our
database of fans and our target market of young adults and families to our content through digital media such as Facebook ,
Twitter , YouTube , Flickr , Instagram  and Snapchat, and draw higher traffic to our website  www.wizardworld.com
 by creating content from our live multimedia events and promoting such events through emails and newsletters. 

We
expect to produce 19 live events during the year ending December 31, 2016. Historically, we have operated profitable live events
in Philadelphia, Chicago, New Orleans, Columbus, Portland, Nashville, Austin, Sacramento, Louisville, Minneapolis, San Antonio,
Atlanta, Tulsa, Reno and St. Louis, but we have operated at a deficit in other events. In order for us to operate a successful
event, we must produce an event that is relevant to the public in order to drive admissions, booth sales, sponsorship, and advertising.
In order for the Company to grow the digital business, we must attract unique users and drive traffic to our online site. To date,
we have exhausted considerable resources developing our media platform, but we have yet to earn a profit from the platform.  

The
Company also plans to produce a live music concert series with well-known emerging and known artists at approximately seven (7)
of its Comic Conventions during 2016. Admissions to the concerts will be sold separately from the admission to the Comic Convention.  

In
addition, the Company through its subsidiary, Wiz Wizard, launched ConBox in April 2015. ConBox is a subscription-based premium
monthly box service featuring collectibles, exclusives, toys, tech and gaming, licensed artwork, superior comics and apparel,
Comic Convention admissions, special VIP discounts and more, which will be shipped on or around the end of every month. The Company
plans to continue to partner with major Comic Convention related brands and celebrities to deliver a high quality and variation
of products directly to the front doors of its subscribers.  

We
continue to develop the Wizard World digital strategy and grow our existing database through social media, on-site activation,
and the Company s digital presence on properties that include Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , Flickr , Instagram 
and Snapchat. Also, as additional events are added, more people join the Wizard World universe and become loyal to the
brand and its affiliated properties.  

Wizardworlddigital.com
continues to be the hub for all Comic Convention and related events news and content, and wizardworld.com continues to act as
the e-commerce engine for all admissions, VIP experiences, one-of-a-kind packages, and more.

used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $1,245,272 and $482,524, respectively.
The net income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $818,118 and $(2,035,793), respectively.  

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net income and net cash used
in operations of $749,885 and ($1,245,272), respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had a working capital of $2,543,922 and an accumulated deficit of $15,263,411. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had cash and cash equivalents of $3,188,406. The Company estimates the cash and cash equivalents currently on hand as of November
20, 2016 is insufficient to fund its operations on a long term basis past December 31, 2016. In order to fund operations past
that date is dependent on management s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with
some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, or the significant reduction of operating
expenses until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no assurance
that the Company s projections and estimates are accurate. The Company is actively managing and controlling the Company s
cash outflows to mitigate these risks.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.    

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s). Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, varying from 3 to 5 years or, when applicable, the life
of the lease, whichever is shorter.  

Carrying
Value, Recoverability and Impairment of long-lived assets   

The
Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) for its long-lived assets. The Company s long-lived assets, which include property and
equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable.  

The
Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated
with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective
carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair
value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than
originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated
useful lives.  

The
Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant
under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant
changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired
assets or changes in the Company s overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv)
increased competitive pressures; and (v) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators
at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.  

The
impairment charges, if any, are included in operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB ASC. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB ASC ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides
guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires
increased disclosures.  

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability
of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.  

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
these jurisdictions. In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company follows Paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB ASC for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is
realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria
are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered
to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Unearned
convention revenue is deposits received for conventions that have not yet taken place, which are fully or partially refundable
depending upon the terms and conditions of the agreements.  

Unearned
ConBox revenue is non-refundable up-front payments for products. These payments are initially deferred and subsequently recognized
over the subscription period, typically three months, and upon shipment of the product.  

The
Company recognizes cost of revenues in the period in which the revenues was earned. In the event the Company incurs cost of revenues
for conventions that are yet to occur, the Company records such amounts as prepaid expenses and such prepaid expenses are expensed
during the period the convention takes place.  

Equity based
compensation   

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for all equity based payments in accordance with ASC 718   Compensation
  Stock Compensation  . Under fair value recognition provisions, the Company recognizes equity based compensation
net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite
service period of the award.  

Restricted
stock awards are granted at the discretion of the Company. These awards are restricted as to the transfer of ownership and generally
vest over the requisite service periods, typically over a four year period (vesting on a straight line basis). The fair
value of a stock award is equal to the fair market value of a share of Company stock on the grant date.  

The
fair value of option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes
option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model. These assumptions are the expected
stock volatility, the risk free interest rate, the expected life of the option, the dividend yield on the underlying stock
and the expected forfeiture rate. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company s
Common stock over the expected option life and other appropriate factors. Risk free interest rates are calculated based
on continuously compounded risk free rates for the appropriate term. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company
has never paid or declared any cash dividends on our Common stock and does not intend to pay dividends on our Common stock in
the foreseeable future. The expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.  

Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards requires the input of the
subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards
represent management s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment.
As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, our equity based compensation could be materially
different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only
for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity based
compensation could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.  

The
Company accounts for share based payments granted to non employees in accordance with ASC 505-40,   Equity
Based Payments to Non Employees  . The Company determines the fair value of the stock based payment as either
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions
as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instruments
is re-measured each reporting period over the requisite service period.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

We
follow Paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosures about fair value of our financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB ASC ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below:  

Level
    1   Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date;   

Level
    2   Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
    observable as of the reporting date; and   

Level
    3   Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amount of the Company s assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and unearned revenue approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those
instruments.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required
to recognize, for all leases of 12 months or more, a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the
right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of
financial statements better understand the nature of an entity s leasing activities. This ASU is effective for public reporting
companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted
using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its condensed
consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing   (topic 606). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross verses Net)   (topic 606). These amendments provide additional
clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance
obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs; and determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides
a customer with either a right to use an entity s intellectual property or a right to access an entity s intellectual
property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service for the principal
versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10
and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an entity s adoption of ASU 2014-09, which we intend to adopt for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   (topic 718). The FASB
issued this update to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified,
including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the new standard.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients  , which narrowly amended the revenue recognition guidance regarding collectability, noncash
consideration, presentation of sales tax and transition and is effective during the same period as ASU 2014-09. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

4. Controls and Procedures.    

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a- 15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ) and Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ),
of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s PEO and PFO concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s PEO and PFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.  

The
Company continues to be committed to improving financial organization. As part of this commitment, management and the Board are
performing an extensive review of the Company s past and current policies and procedures as it relates to financial reporting
in an effort to mitigate future risks of potential misstatements. The former Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Accounting Officer has declined to participate in such review procedures.  The Company will focus on continuing to
develop and documenting internal controls and procedures surrounding the financial reporting process, primarily through the use
of account reconciliations, and supervision.

II   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.    

On October 28,
2016, the Company filed a Complaint (the  Complaint ) and commenced a lawsuit in the United States District Court,
Southern District of New York, against Stephen Shamus, the former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company whose employment was
terminated on October 27, 2016 (the  Shamus Lawsuit ). In the Shamus Lawsuit, the Company alleges, among other things,
breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of corporation assets, breach of contract, and conversion, against Mr. Shamus relating
to the Company s assertion that he used his position with the Company to improperly obtain memorabilia at the Company s
comic conventions which he would then sell and retain the profits from for his own benefit. On November 16, 2016, Mr. Shamus filed
an Answer to the Complaint with counterclaims to the Complaint (the  Counterclaim ). The Counterclaim alleges breach
of contract and unjust enrichment against the Company and seeks compensatory damages in the form of cash. 

The
lawsuit is in an early stage and the Company intends to thoroughly pursue its claims and establish a rigorous defense against
the Counterclaim. In the event we fail to defend against the Counterclaim, we may be subject to a judgment which could materially
impact our financial condition. 

Other than the matter described above, we  are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our
subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our
subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse
effect.

AMENDMENT TO THE    

   BY-LAWS   

   OF   

   WIZARD
WORLD, INC.   

The
By-Laws (the   By-Laws  ) of Wizard World, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly known as  GoEnergy Inc. 
are hereby amended as follows:  

1.       The
following provision shall be inserted as Section 8 of Article I of the By-Laws and each subsequent provision contained in Article
I shall be renumbered accordingly:  

8.
NOTICE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.  

(a)
At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the
meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of record of the corporation.
For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be delivered to or mailed and
received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the sixtieth (60th) day
nor earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s
annual meeting;  provided ,  however , that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the
date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the previous year s annual meeting,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day
prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such annual
meeting or, in the event public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the corporation fewer than seventy
(70) days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation, and with respect to any annual meeting publicly announced
by the corporation within sixty (60) days after adoption of the amendment to this Section 8 of Article I of the By-Laws on November
21, 2016, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting
is first made by the corporation. In no event shall the postponement of a meeting as to which the notice of meeting has been sent
to stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for giving of a stockholder s notice as described
above. A stockholder s notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before
the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for
conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation s books, of
the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned
by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business and (v) any other information that is required
to be disclosed in a proxy statement by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the  1934 Act ), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding anything in
these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this paragraph (a) of Section 8 (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act). The chair
of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (a) of Section 8, and if he should so determine, he
shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.  

(b)
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) of Section 8 shall be eligible
for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation may be made at an
annual meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of record of the corporation
entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph
(b) of Section 8. Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant
to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section
8. Such stockholder s notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation
or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by such person,
