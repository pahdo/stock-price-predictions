1  .    Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Changes in Significant Accounting Policies 
  Ally Financial Inc. (referred to herein as Ally, Parent, we, our, or us) is a leading digital financial services company offering financial products for consumers, businesses, automotive dealers and corporate clients  .   Founded in 1919, we have over 95 years of experience providing a broad array of financial products and services. We operate as a financial holding company (FHC) and a bank holding company (BHC). Our banking subsidiary, Ally Bank, is an award-winning online bank, and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ally Financial Inc.   with   a distinct brand and relentless focus on customers, offering a variety of deposit and other banking products. 
  Our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and that affect income and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures. In developing the estimates and assumptions, management uses all available evidence; however, actual results could differ because of uncertainties associated with estimating the amounts, timing, and likelihood of possible outcomes. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , are unaudited but reflect all adjustments that are, in management s opinion, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except for within the   Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows   and related disclosures in   Note 25   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , where an immaterial amount related to the repurchase of common stock for the period ended September 30, 2015, was reclassified from operating activities to financing activities to appropriately present the prior period amounts. 
  These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements (and the related Notes) included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed on   February 24, 2016  , with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as amended by the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on   May 5, 2016   (referred to herein as the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements). 
  Change in Reportable Segments 
  As a result of a change in how management views and operates our business, during the first quarter of 2016, we made changes in the composition of our operating segments. Financial information related to our Corporate Finance business is presented as a separate reportable segment. Previously, all such activity was included in Corporate and Other. Additionally, only the activity of our ongoing bulk acquisitions of mortgage loans and other originations and refinancing is presented in Mortgage Finance operations. The activity related to the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio is included in Corporate and Other. Our other operating segments, Automotive Finance operations and Insurance operations, were unchanged. Amounts for 2015 have been adjusted to conform to the current management view.     In connection with the change in operating segments, we defined additional classes of finance receivables and loans: Mortgage Finance and Mortgage   Legacy. Mortgage Finance includes consumer mortgage loans from our ongoing mortgage operations and Mortgage   Legacy includes consumer mortgage loans originated prior to 2009. 
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  Business Combinations 
  We account for our business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method we generally record the initial carrying values of purchased assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at fair value on the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill when the acquisition price is greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets. The initial fair value of recognized assets and liabilities are subject to refinement during the measurement period, a period up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition, as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Costs directly related to business combinations are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. 
  Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
  Goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, are reported in other assets. 
  Our intangible assets primarily consist of acquired customer relationships and developed technology, and are amortized using a straight line methodology over their estimated useful lives. We review intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recorded. Refer to   Note 2   for further discussion on intangible assets. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles. We allocate goodwill to applicable reporting units based on the relative fair value of other net assets allocated to those reporting units at the time of the acquisition. In the event we restructure our business, we may reallocate goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment exists. Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed as of August 31 of each year. In certain situations, we may perform a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment. We may also decide to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. If we perform the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and conclude that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is greater than its  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  Ally Financial Inc.   Form 10-Q 

carrying value, then the quantitative assessment is not required. However, if we perform the qualitative assessment and determine that is it more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, then we must perform the quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment uses a two-step process. The first step of the assessment requires us to compare the fair value of each of the reporting units to their respective carrying value. The fair value of the reporting units in our quantitative assessment is determined based on various analyses including discounted cash flow projections using assumptions a market participant would use. If the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists, and the second step does not need to be completed. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value or there is an indication that impairment may exist, a second step must be performed where we determine the implied value of goodwill based on the individual fair values of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, including unrecognized intangibles, to compute the amount of the impairment. Refer to   Note 2   for further discussion on goodwill. 
  Income Taxes 
  In calculating the provision for interim income taxes, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,   Income Taxes  , we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income. At the end of each interim period, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. This method differs from that described in   Note 1   to the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, which describes our annual significant income tax accounting policy and related methodology. 
  Investments 
  Our portfolio of investments includes various debt and marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity investments. Debt and marketable equity securities are classified based on management s intent to sell or hold the security. We classify debt securities as held-to-maturity only when we have both the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. We classify debt and marketable equity securities as trading when the securities are acquired for the purpose of selling or holding them for a short period of time. Securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available-for-sale. 
  Our debt and marketable equity securities include government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS), mortgage-backed securities (MBS), equity securities and other investments. Our portfolio includes securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. Our available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are subject to impairment. Our held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost and are subject to impairment. 
  We amortize premiums and discounts on debt securities as an adjustment to investment yield generally over the stated maturity of the security. For ABS and MBS where prepayments can be reasonably estimated, amortization is adjusted for expected prepayments. 
  Additionally, we assess our debt and marketable equity securities for potential other-than-temporary impairment. We employ a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairment of our debt and marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, the magnitude and duration of the decline in fair value. We also evaluate the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, the performance of the underlying assets for interests in securitized assets, and, for securities classified as available-for-sale, our intent and ability to hold the investment through recovery of its amortized cost basis. 
  Once a decline in fair value of a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge for the credit component is recorded to other gain (loss) on investments, net, in our Consolidated Statement of Income, and a new cost basis in the investment is established. The noncredit loss component of a debt security is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) when we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell the security prior to the security's anticipated recovery. The credit and noncredit loss components are recorded in earnings when we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the security prior to the security s anticipated recovery. Unrealized losses that we have determined to be other-than-temporary on equity securities are recorded to other gain (loss) on investments, net in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequent increases and decreases to the fair value of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are included in other comprehensive income (loss), so long as they are not attributable to another other-than-temporary impairment. 
  Realized gains and losses on investment securities are reported in other gain (loss) on investments, net, and are determined using the specific identification method. For information on our debt and marketable equity securities, refer to   Note 6  . 
  In addition to our investments in debt and marketable equity securities, we hold equity positions in other entities. These positions include Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock held to meet regulatory requirements, other equity investments that are not publicly traded and do not have a readily determinable fair value, equity investments in low income housing tax credits, and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) equity investments. Our investments in FHLB and FRB stock and other equity investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Our low income housing tax credit investments are accounted for using the proportionate amortization method of accounting for qualified affordable housing investments. Our CRA investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Our FHLB and FRB stock and other equity investments carried at cost are included in nonmarketable equity investments in other assets. Our investments in low income housing tax credits and CRA are also included in other assets. As conditions warrant, we review our investments carried at cost for impairment and will adjust the carrying value of the investment if it is deemed to be impaired. No impairment was recognized in 2016 or 2015. For more information on our nonmarketable equity investments, refer to   Note 22  . 
  Refer to   Note 1   to the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements regarding additional significant accounting policies.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (ASU 2015-02) 
  As of January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU (Accounting Standards Update) 2015-02. The amendments in this update modify the requirements of consolidation with respect to entities that are or are similar in nature to limited partnerships or are variable interest entities (VIEs). For entities that are or are similar to limited partnerships, the guidance clarifies the evaluation of kick-out rights, removes the presumption that the general partner will consolidate and generally states that such entities will be presumed to be VIEs unless proven otherwise. For VIEs, the guidance modifies the analysis related to the evaluation of servicing fees, excludes servicing fees that are deemed commensurate with the level of service required from the determination of the primary beneficiary and clarifies certain considerations related to the consolidation analysis when performing a related party assessment. The amendments in this guidance did not impact our historical VIE and consolidation conclusions. No adjustments to our consolidated financial statements were required as a result of the adoption of this guidance. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date (ASU 2015-14) 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09. The purpose of this guidance is to streamline and consolidate existing revenue recognition principles in GAAP and to converge revenue recognition principles with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The core principle of the amendments is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments include a five step process for consideration of the main principle, guidance on the accounting treatment for costs associated with a contract, and disclosure requirements related to the revenue process. As originally issued, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 were to be effective beginning on January 1, 2017. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the guidance until January 1, 2018, and permitted early adoption as of the original effective date in ASU 2014-09. The FASB created a transition resource group to work with stakeholders and clarify the new guidance as necessary. The FASB has issued and is anticipating issuing additional ASUs to provide clarifying guidance and implementation support for ASU 2014-09. Management will consider these additional ASUs when assessing the overall impact of ASU 2014-09. The amendments to the revenue recognition principles can be applied on adoption either through a full retrospective application or on a modified basis with a cumulative effect adjustment on the date of initial adoption with certain practical expedients. Management has determined certain contractual arrangements are in scope of this guidance and is reviewing those in scope in order to determine the impact of the adoption of this guidance. 
  Financial Instruments   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets (ASU 2016-01) 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01. The amendments in this update modify the requirements related to the measurement of certain financial instruments in the statement of financial condition and results of operation. For equity investments (other than investments accounted for using the equity method), entities must measure such instruments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Changes in fair value for available-for-sale equity securities will no longer be recognized through other comprehensive income. Reporting entities may continue to elect to measure equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at cost with adjustments for impairment and observable changes in price. In addition, for a liability (other than a derivative liability) that an entity measures at fair value, any change in fair value related to the instrument-specific credit risk, that is the entity s own-credit, should be presented separately in other comprehensive income and not as a component of net income. The amendments are effective on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted solely for the provisions pertaining to instrument-specific credit risk for liabilities measured at fair value. The amendments must be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of initial adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the amendments. However, we do expect additional volatility in our consolidated results of operations as a result of the requirement to measure equity investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in net income upon adoption. 
  Leases (ASU 2016-02) 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02. The amendments in this update primarily replace the existing accounting requirements for operating leases for lessees. Lessee accounting requirements for finance leases and lessor accounting requirements for both operating leases and sales type and direct financing leases (both of which were previously referred to as capital leases) are largely unchanged. The amendments require the lessee of an operating lease to record a balance sheet gross-up upon lease commencement by recognizing a right-to-use asset and lease liability equal to the present value of the lease payments. The right-to-use asset and lease liability should be derecognized in a manner that effectively yields a straight line lease expense over the lease term. In addition to the changes to the lessee operating lease accounting requirements, the amendments also change the types of costs that can be capitalized related to a lease agreement for both lessees and lessors for all types of leases. The amendments also require additional disclosures for all lease types for both lessees and lessors. The amendments are effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The amendments must be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative adjustment to the beginning of the earliest fiscal year presented in the financial statements in the period of adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments. Upon adoption, we expect to record a gross up in our consolidated statement of financial position upon adoption reflecting our right-to-use asset and lease liability for our operating leases where we are the lessee (for example, our facility leases). We are currently reviewing our operating lease contracts where we are the lessee to determine the impact of the gross up and the changes to capitalizable costs. We are also reviewing our leases where we are the lessor to determine the impact of the changes to capitalizable costs.

Stock Compensation   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09) 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09. The amendments in this update include changes to several aspects of share-based payment accounting. The amendments allow for an entity wide accounting policy election to either account for forfeitures as they occur or estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest. The amendments modify the tax withholding requirements to allow entities to withhold an amount up to the employee s maximum individual statutory tax rates without resulting in a liability classification of the award as opposed to limiting the withholding to the minimum statutory tax rates. The amendments require that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards should be recognized in income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period in which they occur. The amendments also address the classification and presentation of certain items on the cash flow statement. The amendments are effective on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The transition method varies depending on the specific amendment. We do not believe these amendments will have a material impact to the financial statements. 
  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (ASU 2016-13) 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13. The amendments in this update introduce a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost. Credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost should be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of financial assets. In effect, the financial asset or group of financial assets should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Credit losses will no longer be measured as they are incurred for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The amendments also modify the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities whereby credit losses will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than a write-down to the security s cost basis, which allows for reversals of credit losses when estimated credit losses decline. Credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP. The amendments are effective on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. The amendments must be applied using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment through retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year upon adoption. The new accounting model for credit losses represents a significant departure from existing GAAP, which will increase the allowance for credit losses with a resulting negative adjustment to retained earnings. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the amendments. 
   
  2  .     Acquisitions 
  On   June 1, 2016  , we acquired 100% of the equity of TradeKing Group, Inc. (TradeKing),   a digital wealth management company with an online broker/dealer, digital portfolio management platform, and educational content  . for   $298 million   in cash. TradeKing will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ally. The addition of brokerage and wealth management is a natural extension of our online banking franchise, creating a full suite of financial products for savings and investments. We applied the acquisition method of accounting to this transaction, which generally requires the initial recognition of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed at their respective fair value. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the acquisition price after the recognition of the net assets, including the identifiable intangible assets.   Beginning in June 2016, financial information related to TradeKing is included within Corporate and Other.

    Includes   $40 million   in cash proceeds from the acquisition transaction in order to pay employee compensation and benefits that vested upon acquisition as a result of the change in control. 
     The goodwill of   $193 million   arising from the acquisition consists largely of expected growth of the business as we leverage the Ally brand and our marketing capabilities to scale the acquired technology platform and expand the suite of financial products we offer to our existing growing customer base. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to   Note 11   for a reconciliation of the carrying amount of goodwill at the beginning and end of the reporting period. 
  On August 1, 2016, we acquired assets from Blue Yield, an online automotive lender exchange, as we continue to expand our automotive finance offerings to include a direct-to-consumer model. We completed the acquisition for   $28 million   of total consideration. As a result of the purchase, we recognized   $20 million   of goodwill within Automotive Finance operations.

3  .     Discontinued Operations 
  Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-08, which was prospectively applied only to newly identified disposals that qualify as discontinued operations beginning after January 1, 2015, we have classified operations as discontinued when operations and cash flows will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and we do not expect to retain any significant continuing involvement in their operations after the respective sale or disposal transactions. For all periods presented, the operating results for these discontinued operations have been removed from continuing operations and presented separately as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the   Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income  . The Notes to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. 
  Select Automotive Finance Operations 
  During the fourth quarter of 2012 we entered into an agreement with General Motors Financial Company Inc. (GMF) to sell our   40%   interest in a motor vehicle finance joint venture in China. On January 2, 2015, the sale of our interest in the motor vehicle finance joint venture in China was completed and an after-tax gain of approximately   $400 million   was recorded. The tax expense included in this gain was reduced by the release of the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset that was utilized to offset capital gains stemming from this sale. The remaining activity relates to previous discontinued operations for which we continue to have minimal residual costs. 
  Other Operations 
  Other operations relate to previous discontinued operations for which we continue to have wind-down, legal, and minimal operational costs. Refer to   Note 26   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , titled   Contingencies and Other Risks  , for additional discussion. 
  Select Financial Information

The maturity distribution of investment securities outstanding is summarized in the following tables. Call or prepayment options may cause actual maturities to differ from contractual maturities. 

(a) 
    Yield is calculated using the effective yield of each security at the end of the period, weighted based on the market value. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon and amortized cost, and excludes expected capital gains and losses. 
     The balances of cash equivalents were   $0.8 billion   and   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and were composed primarily of money market accounts and short-term securities, including U.S. Treasury bills.

The following table presents gross gains and losses realized upon the sales of available-for-sale securities and other-than-temporary impairment.   

           (a) 
    Certain available-for-sale securities were sold at a loss in 2016 and   2015   as a result of changing conditions within these respective periods (e.g., a downgrade in the rating of a debt security). Any such sales were made in accordance with our risk management policies and practices. 
     The table below summarizes available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income. Based on the assessment of whether such losses were deemed to be other-than-temporary, we believe that the unrealized losses are not indicative of an other-than-temporary impairment of these securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have the intent to sell the debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the ability and intent to hold equity securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income are not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . Refer to   Note 1   for additional information related to investment securities and our methodology for evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) are loan modifications where concessions were granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. For mortgage loans, as part of our participation in certain governmental programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. Numerous initiatives are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates. Additionally, for automotive loans, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers, including extension of the loan maturity date and rewriting the loan terms. Total TDRs recorded at gross carrying value were   $640 million   and   $625 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

  Investments in operating leases were as follows. 

Depreciation expense on operating lease assets includes remarketing gains and losses recognized on the sale of operating lease assets. The following summarizes the components of depreciation expense on operating lease assets. 

9  .    Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
  We are involved in several types of securitization and financing transactions that utilize special-purpose entities (SPEs). A SPE is an entity that is designed to fulfill a specified limited need of the sponsor. Our principal use of SPEs is to obtain liquidity by securitizing certain of our financial assets and operating lease assets. 
  The transaction-specific SPEs involved in our securitization and other financing transactions are often considered VIEs. VIEs are entities that have either a total equity investment at risk that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors at risk lack the ability to control the entity's activities. 
  We provide a wide range of consumer and commercial automotive loans, operating leases, and commercial loans to a diverse customer base. We securitize consumer and commercial automotive loans, and operating leases through private-label securitizations. We often securitize these loans and notes secured by operating leases (collectively referred to as financial assets) through the use of securitization entities, which may or may not be consolidated on our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  .

We provide long-term guarantee contracts to investors in certain nonconsolidated affordable housing entities and have extended a line of credit to provide liquidity and minimize our exposure under these contracts. Since we do not have control over the entities or the power to make decisions, we do not consolidate the entities and our involvement is limited to the guarantee and the line of credit. 
  We have involvement with various other nonconsolidated equity investments, including affordable housing entities and venture capital funds and loan funds. We do not consolidate these entities and our involvement is limited to our outstanding investment, additional capital committed to these funds plus any previously recognized low income housing tax credits that are subject to recapture. 
  Refer to Note 10 to the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of our securitization activities and our involvement with VIEs. 
  Our involvement with consolidated and nonconsolidated VIEs in which we hold variable interests is presented below. 

(a) 
    Asset values represent the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans within the VIEs. 
              (b) 
    Includes   $10.0 billion   and   $10.6 billion   of assets that are not encumbered by VIE beneficial interests held by third parties at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Ally or consolidated affiliates hold the interests in these assets which eliminate in consolidation. 
              (c) 
    Includes VIEs for which we have no management oversight and therefore we are not able to provide the total assets of the VIEs. 
              (d) 
    Maximum exposure to loss represents the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding loans based on our customary representation and warranty provisions and certain noncertificated interests retained from the sale of automotive finance receivables. This measure is based on the unlikely event that all of the loans have underwriting defects or other defects that trigger a representation and warranty provision and the collateral supporting the loans are worthless. This required disclosure is not an indication of our expected loss. 
               (f) 
    For certain nonconsolidated affordable housing entities, maximum exposure to loss represents the yield we guaranteed investors through long term guarantee contracts. The amount disclosed is based on the unlikely event that the underlying properties cease generating yield to investors and the yield delivered to investors in the form of low income tax housing credits is recaptured. For nonconsolidated equity investments, maximum exposure to loss represents our outstanding investment, additional committed capital, and low income housing tax credits subject to recapture. The amount disclosed is based on the unlikely event that our committed capital is funded, our investments become worthless, and the tax credits previously delivered to us are recaptured. This required disclosure is not an indication of our expected loss.

  Automotive Finance Servicing Activities 
  We service consumer automotive contracts. Historically, we have sold a portion of our consumer automotive contracts. With respect to contracts we sell, we retain the right to service and earn a servicing fee for our servicing function. We have concluded that the fee we are paid for servicing consumer automotive finance receivables represents adequate compensation, and consequently, we do not recognize a servicing asset or liability. We recognized automotive servicing fee income of   $18 million   and   $49 million   during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $12 million   and   $32 million   during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

  The following table presents the composition of our short-term borrowings portfolio. 

(a) 
    Refer to   Note 14   for further details on assets restricted as collateral for payment of the related debt. 
     We periodically enter into term repurchase agreements, short-term borrowing agreements in which we sell financial instruments to one or more investors while simultaneously committing to repurchase them at a specified future date, at the stated price plus accrued interest.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the financial instruments sold under agreement to repurchase consisted of   mortgage-backed residential securities with the following maturities:   $304 million     within the next 30 days and     $355 million     within 31 to 60 days.   Refer to   Note 6   and   Note 23   for further details on investment securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 
  The primary risk associated with these repurchase agreements is that the counterparty will be unable to perform under the terms of the contract. As the borrower, we are exposed to the excess market value of the securities pledged over the amount borrowed. Daily mark-to-market collateral management is designed to limit this risk to the initial margin. However, should a counterparty declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, we may incur additional delays and costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we placed cash collateral totaling   $7 million   with counterparties under these collateral arrangements associated with our repurchase agreements.

      Trust Preferred Securities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we have issued and outstanding approximately   $2.6 billion   in aggregate liquidation preference of 8.125% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Trust Preferred Securities, Series 2 (Series 2 TRUPS) net of original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Each Series 2 TRUPS security has a liquidation amount of $25. Distributions are cumulative and are payable until redemption at the applicable coupon rate. Distributions were payable at an annual rate of 8.125% payable quarterly in arrears, through but excluding February 15, 2016. From and including February 15, 2016, to but excluding February 15, 2040, distributions will be payable at an annual rate equal to three-month London interbank offer rate plus 5.785% payable quarterly in arrears, beginning May 15, 2016. Ally has the right to defer payments of interest for a period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters. The Series 2 TRUPS have no stated maturity date, but must be redeemed upon the redemption or maturity of the related debentures (Debentures), which mature on February 15, 2040. Ally at any time on or after February 15, 2016 may redeem the Series 2 TRUPS at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption. The Series 2 TRUPS are generally nonvoting, other than with respect to certain limited matters. During any period in which any Series 2 TRUPS remain outstanding but in which distributions on the Series 2 TRUPS have not been fully paid, none of Ally or its subsidiaries will be permitted to (i) declare or pay dividends on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or otherwise make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of Ally s capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto; or (ii) make any payments of principal, interest, or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees that rank on a parity with or junior in interest to the Debentures with certain specified exceptions in each case. 
  Funding Facilities 
  We utilize both committed credit facilities and other collateralized funding vehicles. The debt outstanding under our various funding facilities is included on our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Ally Bank had exclusive access to   $3.6 billion   of funding capacity from committed credit facilities. Funding programs supported by the Federal Reserve and the FHLB, together with repurchase agreements, complement Ally Bank s private collateralized funding vehicles. 
  The total capacity in our committed funding facilities is provided by banks and other financial institutions through private transactions. The committed secured funding facilities can be revolving in nature and allow for additional funding during the commitment period, or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the closing date. At   September 30, 2016  , all of our   $18.1 billion   of committed capacity was revolving. Our revolving facilities generally have an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $14.1 billion   of committed funding capacity from revolving facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days.

18  .    Earnings per Common Share 
  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. 

(a) 
    Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. 
              (b) 
    Preferred stock dividends for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , include   $1,193 million   recognized in connection with the partial redemption of the Series G Preferred Stock and the repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock. These dividends represent an additional return to preferred shareholders calculated as the excess consideration paid over the carrying amount derecognized. 
              (c) 
    Includes shares related to share-based compensation that vested but were not yet issued for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
              (d) 
    Due to the antidilutive effect of the net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , basic weighted-average common shares outstanding was used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. 
      
  19  .    Regulatory Capital and Other Regulatory Matters 
  As a BHC, we and our wholly-owned state-chartered banking subsidiary, Ally Bank, are subject to capital requirements issued by U.S. banking regulators that require us to maintain risk-based and leverage capital ratios above minimum levels. A risk-based capital ratio is a ratio of a banking organization s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets. A leverage capital ratio is a ratio of a banking organization s regulatory capital to a measure of assets or exposures that is not risk-weighted. As of January 1, 2015, Ally and Ally Bank became subject to the rules implementing the 2010 Basel III capital framework in the United States (U.S. Basel III), which reflect new and higher capital requirements, capital buffers, and new regulatory capital definitions, deductions and adjustments. Certain aspects of U.S. Basel III, including the new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. 
  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary action by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   or the results of operations and financial condition of Ally and Ally Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we and Ally Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items. These measures and related classifications, which are used in the calculation of our risk-based and leverage capital ratios and those of Ally Bank, are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the components of capital, the risk-weightings of assets and other exposures, and other factors. The U.S. banking regulators also use these ratios and guidelines as part of the capital planning and stress testing processes. In addition, in order for Ally to maintain its status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain  well-capitalized  and  well-managed,  as defined under applicable law. Effective January 1, 2015, the  well-capitalized  standard for insured depository institutions, such as Ally Bank, was revised to reflect the new and higher capital requirements under U.S. Basel III. 
  Under U.S. Basel III, Ally must maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of     4.5%  , a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of     6%  , and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of     8%  . In addition to these minimum requirements, Ally is also subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of more than     2.5%  ,   subject to a phase-in from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer will result in restrictions on Ally s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payment and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. In addition to these new risk-based capital standards, U.S. Basel III subjects all U.S. banking organizations, including Ally, to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of   4%  ,   the denominator of which takes into account only on-balance sheet assets.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

In addition to introducing new capital ratios, U.S. Basel III revises the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provides for the phase-out of instruments that had previously been recognized as capital but that do not satisfy the new criteria. Subject to certain exceptions (e.g., for certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act), trust preferred and other  hybrid  securities are no longer included in a BHC's Tier 1 capital as of January 1, 2016. Also, subject to a phase-in schedule, certain new items are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and certain other deductions from regulatory capital have been modified. Among other things, U.S. Basel III requires significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights, and certain deferred tax assets that exceed specified individual and aggregate thresholds to be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital. U.S. Basel III also revises the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets by, among other things, modifying certain risk weights and introducing new methods for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain types of assets and exposures. 
  Ally is subject to the U.S. Basel III standardized approach for credit risk. It is not subject to the U.S. Basel III advanced approaches for credit risk. Ally is currently not subject to the U.S. market risk capital rule, which applies only to banking organizations with significant trading assets and liabilities. 
  On March 7, 2016, Ally Bank received approval from the Federal Reserve to become a state member bank. Ally Bank is now regulated by the FRB through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, as well as the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. In addition, in connection with the application for membership in the Federal Reserve System, Ally Bank made commitments to the FRB relating to capital, liquidity, and business plan requirements. These commitments are consistent with the prior requirements under the now-terminated Capital and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), including the requirement to maintain capital at a level such that Ally Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio is at least   15%  . For this purpose, the leverage ratio is determined in accordance with the FRB's regulations related to capital maintenance. As a requirement of Federal Reserve membership, on March 21, 2016, Ally Bank purchased   $435 million   of FRB stock. 
  Compliance with capital requirements is a strategic priority for Ally. We expect to be in compliance with all applicable requirements within the established timeframes. 
  The following table summarizes our capital ratios under the U.S. Basel III capital framework. 

(a) 
    Currently, there is no ratio component for determining whether a BHC is "well-capitalized." 
              (b) 
    Federal regulatory reporting guidelines require the calculation of adjusted quarterly average assets using a daily average methodology. 
              (c) 
    Ally Bank has committed to the FRB to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least   15%  . 
     At   September 30, 2016  , Ally and Ally Bank were  well-capitalized  and met all capital requirements to which each was subject. 
  Capital Planning and Stress Tests 
  As a BHC with   $50 billion   or more of consolidated assets, Ally is required to conduct periodic company-run stress tests, is subject to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, and must submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. 
  Ally s capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. The capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios under baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB must approve Ally's capital plan before Ally may take any capital action. Even with an approved capital plan, Ally must seek the approval of the FRB before making a capital distribution if, among other factors, Ally would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution.

On April 5, 2016, we submitted the results of our semi-annual stress test and our annual capital plan to the FRB. On June 23, 2016, we publicly disclosed summary results of the stress test under the most severe scenario in accordance with regulatory requirements. On June 29, 2016, we received a non-objection to our capital plan from the FRB, including the proposed capital actions contained in our submission. The proposed capital actions include a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.08   per share of our common stock, subject to quarterly approval by the Board of Directors, and the ability to repurchase up to   $700 million   of our common stock from time to time through the second quarter of 2017. In addition, we submitted to the FRB the results of our company-run mid-year stress test conducted under multiple macroeconomic scenarios and disclosed the results of this stress test under the most severe scenario on October 5, 2016, in accordance with regulatory requirements. 
  On July 18, 2016, the Ally Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of   $0.08   per share on all common stock. The dividend was paid on August 15, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 1, 2016. On   October 18, 2016  , the Ally Board of Directors declared a second quarterly cash dividend payment of   $0.08   per share on all common stock. Refer to   Note 27   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further information regarding this common share dividend. Additionally, the Ally Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to   $700 million   beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and continuing through the second quarter of 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased   $159 million  , or   8,297,653   shares of common stock under this program which reduced total shares outstanding by approximately 1.7%. We had   475,469,882   shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2016. 
  In September 2016, the FRB proposed a rule that would, among other things, revise the capital plan rule to no longer subject large and noncomplex firms, including Ally, to the provisions of the existing rule whereby the FRB may object to a capital plan on the basis of qualitative deficiencies in the firm s capital planning process. Under the proposed rule, the qualitative assessment of Ally s capital plan would be conducted outside of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, through the supervisory review process, and Ally s reporting requirements would be modified to reduce certain reporting burdens related to capital planning and stress testing. The proposed rule would take effect for the 2017 capital planning cycle. 
   
  20  .    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  We enter into interest rate, foreign-currency, and equity swaps, futures, forwards, options, and swaptions in connection with our market risk management activities. Derivative instruments are used to manage interest rate risk relating to specific groups of assets and liabilities, including automotive loan assets and debt. We use foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign-currency risk associated with foreign-currency-denominated debt, foreign exchange transactions, and our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we also enter into equity option contracts to manage our exposure to the equity markets. Our primary objective for utilizing derivative financial instruments is to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed- and variable-rate assets and liabilities, foreign exchange risks related to our foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, and market risks related to our investment portfolio and certain of our executive share-based compensation plans. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We monitor our mix of fixed- and variable-rate assets and liabilities. When it is cost-effective to do so, we may enter into interest rate swaps, forwards, futures, options, and swaptions to achieve our desired mix of fixed- and variable-rate assets and liabilities. We execute interest rate swaps, forwards, futures, options, and swaptions to modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting certain fixed-rate instruments to a variable-rate and certain variable-rate instruments to a fixed-rate. We use a mix of both derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and economic hedges. 
  Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting consist of receive-fixed swaps designated as fair value hedges of specific fixed-rate unsecured debt obligations, receive-fixed swaps designated as fair value hedges of specific fixed-rate FHLB advances and pay-fixed swaps designated as fair value hedges of specific portfolios of fixed-rate held-for-investment retail automotive loan assets. In 2015, we also had pay-fixed swaps designated as cash flow hedges of the expected future cash flows in the form of interest payments on certain outstanding variable-rate borrowings associated with our secured debt. 
  We also execute economic hedges, which consist of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps held to mitigate interest rate risk associated with our debt portfolio. We also use interest rate swaps to economically hedge our net fixed-versus-variable interest rate exposure. We enter into economic hedges in the form of short-dated, exchange-traded Eurodollar futures to hedge the interest rate exposure of our fixed-rate automotive loans, as well as forwards, options, and swaptions to economically hedge our net fixed-versus-variable interest rate exposure. 
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
  We enter into derivative financial instrument contracts to mitigate the risk associated with variability in cash flows related to our various foreign-currency exposures. 
  We enter into foreign-currency forwards with external counterparties as net investment hedges of foreign exchange exposure on our investments in foreign subsidiaries. Our equity is impacted by the cumulative translation adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign subsidiary results; this impact is reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. We also enter into foreign-currency forwards to economically hedge our foreign-denominated debt, our centralized lending program, and foreign-denominated third party loans. These forward currency forwards that are used as economic hedges are recorded at fair value with changes recorded as income offsetting the gains and losses on the associated foreign-currency transactions.

We utilized a cross-currency swap to economically hedge foreign exchange exposure on foreign-currency-denominated debt by converting the funding currency to our functional currency. This swap matured during the second quarter of 2015. 
  Market Risk 
  We enter into equity options to economically hedge our exposure to the equity markets. We purchase options to assume a long position on certain equities and write options to assume a short position. 
  We also enter into prepaid equity forward contracts to economically hedge the price risk associated with certain of our executive share-based compensation plans. The prepaid equity forward contracts are hybrid instruments containing an embedded forward contract, which is considered a derivative instrument. The embedded derivative instrument is bifurcated from the host contract and is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in compensation and benefits expense. The balance of the prepaid component of these equity forward contracts was   $17 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and was recorded within other assets on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  . 
  Counterparty Credit Risk 
  Derivative financial instruments contain an element of credit risk if counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.   Credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments is measured as the net replacement cost should the counterparties that owe us under the contract completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral as measured by the market value of the derivative financial instrument. 
  To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we maintain collateral agreements with certain counterparties. The agreements require both parties to post collateral in the event the fair values of the derivative financial instruments meet posting thresholds established under the agreements. In the event that either party defaults on the obligation, the secured party may seize the collateral. Generally, our collateral arrangements are bilateral such that we and the counterparty post collateral for the value of our total obligation to each other. Contractual terms provide for standard and customary exchange of collateral based on changes in the market value of the outstanding derivatives. The securing party posts additional collateral when their obligation rises or removes collateral when it falls. 
  Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified credit risk-related event. No such specified credit risk related events occurred during the third quarter of 2016. 
  We placed cash collateral totaling   $70 million   and securities collateral totaling   $49 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $103 million   and   $86 million   at   December 31, 2015  , respectively, in accounts maintained by counterparties. This amount primarily relates to collateral posted to support our derivative positions. This amount also excludes cash and securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we placed cash collateral totaling   $7 million   and   $21 million  , respectively, with counterparties under collateral arrangements associated with repurchase agreements. Refer to   Note 13   for details on the repurchase agreements. The receivables for cash collateral placed are included in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet   in other assets. 
  We received cash collateral from counterparties totaling   $113 million   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily to support these derivative positions. We received cash collateral from counterparties totaling   $82 million   at   December 31, 2015  . This amount also excludes cash and securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements. Refer to   Note 13   for details on the repurchase agreements. The payables for cash collateral received are included on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. In certain circumstances, we receive or post securities as collateral with counterparties. We do not record collateral received on our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet   unless certain conditions are met. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we received noncash collateral of   $2 million   and   $7 million  , respectively. Included in these amounts is noncash collateral where we have been granted the right to sell or pledge the underlying assets. We have not sold or pledged any of the noncash collateral received under these agreements.

Balance Sheet Presentation 
  The following table summarizes the fair value amounts of derivative instruments reported on our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  . The fair value amounts are presented on a gross basis, are segregated by derivatives that are designated and qualifying as hedging instruments or those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. Notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual obligations are derived and are not recorded on the balance sheet. In our view, derivative notional is not an accurate measure of our derivative exposure when viewed in isolation from other factors, such as market rate fluctuations and counterparty credit risk. 

(a) 
    Derivative contracts in a receivable position are classified as other assets on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  , and includes accrued interest of   $7 million   and   $46 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (b) 
    Derivative contracts in a liability position are classified as accrued expenses and other liabilities on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  , and includes accrued interest of   $1 million   and   $12 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (c) 
    Includes fair value hedges consisting of receive-fixed swaps on fixed-rate unsecured debt obligations with   $104 million   and   $112 million   in a receivable position,   $0 million   and   $3 million   in a payable position, and a   $2.3 billion   and   $6.8 billion   notional amount at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The hedge notional amount of   $2.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , is associated with debt maturing in five or more years. 
              (d) 
    Includes fair value hedges consisting of receive-fixed swaps on fixed-rate secured debt obligations (FHLB Advances) with   $10 million   and   $1 million   in a receivable position,   $0 million   and   $2 million   in a payable position, and a   $898 million   and   $500 million   notional amount at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (e) 
    Other fair value hedges include pay-fixed swaps on portfolios of held-for-investment automotive loan assets with   $0 million   and   $13 million   in a receivable position,   $7 million   and   $3 million   in a payable position, and a   $3.5 billion   and   $6.8 billion   notional amount at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Statement of Comprehensive Income Presentation 
  The following table summarizes the location and amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in our   Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income  . 

(a) 
    Amounts exclude losses related to interest for qualifying accounting hedges of retail automotive loans held-for-investment, which are primarily offset by the fixed coupon payments of the loans. The losses were   $4 million   and   $18 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, and   $16 million   and   $50 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
              (b) 
    Amounts exclude gains related to interest for qualifying accounting hedges of unsecured debt, which are primarily offset by the fixed coupon payment on the long-term debt. The gains were   $7 million   and   $24 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, and   $34 million   and   $71 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
              (c) 
    Amounts exclude gains related to interest for qualifying accounting hedges of secured debt (FHLB Advances), which are primarily offset by the fixed coupon payment on the long-term debt. The gains were   $1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
              (d) 
    Amounts exclude losses related to amortization of deferred loan basis adjustments on the de-designated hedged item of   $6 million   and   $1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, and   $15 million   and   $1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
               (f) 
    Amounts exclude gains and losses related to the revaluation of the related foreign-denominated debt or receivable. Gains of   $1 million   were recognized for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , and gains of   $4 million   and   $134 million   were recognized for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively.

    The amounts represent the effective portion of net investment hedges. There are offsetting amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the revaluation of the related net investment in foreign operations, including the tax impacts of the hedge and related net investment, as disclosed separately in   Note 17  . There were losses of   $2 million   and   $16 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. There were gains of   $9 million   and losses of   $56 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 
      
  21  .    Income Taxes 
  We recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of   $130 million   and   $336 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $144 million   and   $341 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily driven by lower pretax earnings. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily driven by a tax benefit that resulted from a U.S. tax reserve release related to a prior year federal return that reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. This tax benefit was offset by increases in tax expense attributable to higher pretax earnings and the establishment of a valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards. 
  As of each reporting date, we consider existing evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. We continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for capital loss carryforwards, certain foreign tax credits and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we continue to provide a full valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards and a partial valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to foreign tax credits and state net operating loss carryforwards. 
   
  22  .    Fair Value 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  For purposes of this disclosure, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Fair value is based on the assumptions we believe market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Additionally, entities are required to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity s own credit standing, when measuring the fair value of a liability. 
  GAAP specifies a three-level hierarchy that is used when measuring and disclosing fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices available in active markets (i.e., observable inputs) and the lowest priority to data lacking transparency (i.e., unobservable inputs). An instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. The following is a description of the three hierarchy levels. 
           Level 1 
    Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Additionally, the entity must have the ability to access the active market, and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity. 
              Level 2 
    Inputs are other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
              Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent management's best assumptions of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation. 
              Transfers 
    Transfers into or out of any hierarchy level are recognized at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. There were no transfers between any levels for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. 
             
    Available-for-sale securities     All classes of available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value based on observable market prices, when available. If observable market prices are not available, our valuations are based on internally developed discounted cash flow models (an income approach) that use a market-based discount rate and consider recent market transactions, experience with similar securities, current business conditions, and analysis of the underlying collateral, as available. To estimate cash flows, we are required to utilize various significant assumptions including market observable inputs (e.g., forward interest rates) and internally developed inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). 
                
    Interests retained in financial asset sales     Includes certain noncertificated interests retained from the sale of automotive finance receivables. Due to inactivity in the market, valuations are based on internally developed discounted cash flow models (an income approach) that use a market-based discount rate; therefore, we classified these assets as Level 3. The valuation considers recent market transactions, experience with similar assets, current business conditions, and analysis of the underlying collateral, as available. To estimate cash flows, we utilize various significant assumptions, including market observable inputs (e.g., forward interest rates) and internally developed inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). 
                
    Derivative instruments     We enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments as part of our risk management strategies. Certain of these derivatives are exchange traded, such as Eurodollar futures, options of Eurodollar futures, and equity options. To determine the fair value of these instruments, we utilize the quoted market prices for the particular derivative contracts; therefore, we classified these contracts as Level 1. 
     We also execute over-the-counter (OTC) and centrally-cleared derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, a cross-currency swap, swaptions, foreign-currency denominated forward contracts, prepaid equity forward contracts, caps, floors, and agency to-be-announced securities. For OTC contracts, we utilize third-party-developed valuation models that are widely accepted in the market to value these OTC derivative contracts. The specific terms of the contract and market observable inputs (such as interest rate forward curves, interpolated volatility assumptions, or equity pricing) are used in the model. We classified these OTC derivative contracts as Level 2 because all significant inputs into these models were market observable. For centrally-cleared contracts, we utilize unadjusted prices obtained from the clearing house as the basis for valuation, and they are also classified as Level 2. We did not have any derivative instruments classified as Level 3 as of   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . 
  We are required to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including our own credit standing, when measuring fair value of a liability. We reduce credit risk on the majority of our derivatives by entering into legally enforceable agreements that enable the posting and receiving of collateral associated with the fair value of our derivative positions on an ongoing basis. In the event that we do not enter into legally enforceable agreements that enable the posting and receiving of collateral, we will consider our credit risk and the credit risk of our counterparties in the valuation of derivative instruments through a credit valuation adjustment (CVA), if warranted. The CVA calculation utilizes the credit default swap spreads of the counterparty.

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets 
  We elected the fair value option for an insignificant amount of conforming and government-insured mortgage loans held-for-sale. We elected the fair value option to mitigate earnings volatility by better matching the accounting for the assets with the related hedges. Our intent in electing fair value measurement was to mitigate a divergence between accounting losses and economic exposure for certain assets and liabilities. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The following table presents the carrying and estimated fair value of financial instruments, except for those recorded at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the previous section of this note titled   Recurring Fair Value.   When possible, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. Where quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is internally derived based on appropriate valuation methodologies with respect to the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting current market data to develop the market assumptions and inputs necessary to estimate fair value. As such, the actual amount received to sell an asset or the amount paid to settle a liability could differ from our estimates. Fair value information presented herein was based on information available at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair value for the significant classes of financial instruments. In addition to the valuation methods discussed below, we also followed guidelines for determining whether a market was not active and a transaction was not distressed. We assumed the price that would be received in an orderly transaction (including a market-based return) and not in forced liquidation or distressed sale. 
             
    Cash and cash equivalents     Included in cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted price, or penalty on withdrawal. Classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents generally expose us to limited credit risk and are so near maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the carrying value approximates the fair value of these instruments. 
                
    Held-to-maturity securities     Held-to-maturity securities, which consist of residential mortgage-backed debt securities issued by government agencies, are carried at amortized cost. For fair value disclosure purposes, held-to-maturity securities are classified as Level 2, with fair value based on observable market prices, when available. 
                
    Finance receivables and loans, net     With the exception of mortgage loans held-for-investment, the fair value of finance receivables and loans was based on discounted future cash flows using applicable spreads to approximate current rates applicable to each category of finance receivables and loans (an income approach using Level 3 inputs). The carrying value of commercial receivables in certain markets and certain automotive and other receivables for which interest rates reset on a short-term basis with  
     
   47 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  Ally Financial Inc.   Form 10-Q 

applicable market indices are assumed to approximate fair value either because of the short-term nature or because of the interest rate adjustment feature. The fair value of commercial receivables in other markets was based on discounted future cash flows using applicable spreads to approximate current rates applicable to similar assets in those markets. 
  The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-investment was based on a discounted cash flow basis utilizing cash flow projections from internally developed models that utilized prepayment, default, and discount rate assumptions. These valuations consider unique attributes of the loans such as geography, delinquency status, product type, and other factors. 
             
    Nonmarketable equity investments     Nonmarketable equity investments primarily include investments in FHLB and FRB stock and other equity investments carried at cost. As a member of the FHLB and FRB, Ally Bank is required to hold FHLB and FRB stock. The stock can be sold only to the FHLB and FRB upon termination of membership, or redeemed at the sole discretion of the FHLB and FRB, respectively. The fair value of FHLB and FRB stock is equal to the stock s par value since the stock is bought, sold, and/or redeemed at par. FHLB and FRB stock is carried at cost, which generally represents the stock s par value. 
                
    Deposit liabilities     Deposit liabilities represent certain consumer and brokered bank deposits, mortgage escrow deposits, and dealer deposits. The fair value of deposits at Level 3 were estimated by discounting projected cash flows based on discount factors derived from the forward interest rate swap curve. 
                
    Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt     Level 2 debt was valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments, when available, or other means for substantiation with observable inputs. Debt valued by discounting projected cash flows using internally derived inputs, such as prepayment speeds and discount rates, was classified as Level 3. 
                
    Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value     Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are carried at amounts that approximate fair value primarily due to their short term nature and limited credit risk. These instruments include restricted cash, cash collateral, accrued interest receivable, accrued interest payable, trade receivables and payables, and other short term receivables and payables. 
      
  23  .    Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
  Our derivative contracts and repurchase/reverse repurchase transactions are supported by qualifying master netting and master repurchase agreements. These agreements are legally enforceable bilateral agreements that (1) create a single legal obligation for all individual transactions covered by the agreement to the nondefaulting entity upon an event of default of the counterparty, including bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding, and (2) provide the nondefaulting entity the right to accelerate, terminate, and close-out on a net basis all transactions under the agreement and to liquidate or set off collateral promptly upon an event of default of the counterparty. 
  To further mitigate the risk of counterparty default related to derivative instruments, we maintain collateral agreements with certain counterparties. The agreements require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of the derivative financial instruments meet established thresholds. In the event that either party defaults on the obligation, the secured party may seize the collateral. Generally, our collateral arrangements are bilateral such that we and the counterparty post collateral for the value of our total obligation to each other. Contractual terms provide for standard and customary exchange of collateral based on changes in the market value of the outstanding derivatives. The securing party posts additional collateral when their obligation rises or removes collateral when it falls, such that the net replacement cost of the nondefaulting party is covered in the event of counterparty default. 
  In certain instances as it relates to our derivative instruments, we have the option to report derivative assets and liabilities as well as assets and liabilities associated with cash collateral received or delivered that is governed by a master netting agreement on a net basis as long as certain qualifying criteria are met. Similarly, for our repurchase/reverse repurchase transactions, we have the option to report recognized assets and liabilities subject to a master netting agreement on a net basis if certain qualifying criteria are met. At   September 30, 2016  , these instruments are reported as gross assets and gross liabilities on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  .

  24  .    Segment and Geographic Information 
  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activity from which revenues are earned and expenses incurred for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
  Change in Reportable Segments 
  As a result of a change in how management views and operates our business, during the first quarter of 2016, we made changes in the composition of our operating segments. Financial information related to our Corporate Finance business is presented as a separate reportable segment. Previously, all such activity was included in Corporate and Other. Additionally, only the activity of our ongoing bulk acquisitions of mortgage loans and other originations and refinancing is presented in Mortgage Finance operations. The activity related to the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio is included in Corporate and Other. Our other operating segments, Automotive Finance operations and Insurance operations, were unchanged. Amounts for 2015 have been adjusted to conform to the current management view. 
  We report our results of operations on a line-of-business basis through four operating segments: Automotive Finance operations, Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance operations, and Corporate Finance operations, with the remaining activity reported in Corporate and Other. The operating segments are determined based on the products and services offered, and reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. The following is a description of each of our reportable operating segments. 
  Automotive Finance operations       Provides automotive financing services to consumers and automotive dealers. Our automotive financing services include providing retail installment sales financing, loans, and leases; offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and other lines of credit to dealers; fleet financing, and vehicle remarketing services. 
  Insurance operations     Offers both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold to dealers. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we provide vehicle service contracts, maintenance coverage, and guaranteed asset protection products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers' vehicle inventories.

Mortgage Finance operations     Includes the management of a held-for-investment consumer mortgage finance loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of high-quality jumbo and low-to-moderate income mortgage loans purchased or originated after January 1, 2009. 
  Corporate Finance operations     Primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle market companies. The loans are used to support leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, restructurings, and working capital. 
  Corporate and Other primarily consists of activity related to centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, the amortization of the discount associated with new debt issuances and bond exchanges, and the residual impacts of our corporate funds-transfer pricing (FTP) and treasury asset liability management (ALM) activities. Corporate and Other also includes certain equity investments, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. Additionally, beginning in June 2016, financial information related to TradeKing is included within Corporate and Other. 
  We utilize an FTP methodology for the majority of our business operations. The FTP methodology assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities based on expected duration and the benchmark rate curve plus an assumed credit spread. Matching duration allocates interest income and interest expense to these reportable segments so their respective results are insulated from interest rate risk. This methodology is consistent with our ALM practices, which includes managing interest rate risk centrally at a corporate level. The net residual impact of the FTP methodology is included within the results of Corporate and Other. 
  The information presented in our reportable operating segments and geographic areas tables that follow are based in part on internal allocations, which involve management judgment. 
  Financial information for our reportable operating segments is summarized as follows.

  25  .    Parent and Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements 
  Certain of our senior notes issued by the parent are guaranteed by 100% directly owned subsidiaries of Ally (the Guarantors). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Guarantors include Ally US LLC and IB Finance Holding Company, LLC (IB Finance), each of which fully and unconditionally guarantee the senior notes on a joint and several basis. 
  The following financial statements present condensed consolidating financial data for (i) Ally Financial Inc. (on a parent company-only basis); (ii) the Guarantors; (iii) the nonguarantor subsidiaries (all other subsidiaries); and (iv) an elimination column for adjustments to arrive at (v) the information for the parent company, the Guarantors, and nonguarantors on a consolidated basis. 
  Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for by the parent company and the Guarantors using the equity-method for this presentation. Results of operations of subsidiaries are therefore classified in the parent company s and Guarantors  investment in subsidiaries accounts. The elimination entries set forth in the following condensed consolidating financial statements eliminate distributed and undistributed income of subsidiaries, investments in subsidiaries, and intercompany balances and transactions between the parent, the Guarantors, and nonguarantors.

26  .    Contingencies and Other Risks 
  Legal Matters 
  Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our lines of business and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages. 
  We accrue for a legal matter when a loss becomes probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are evaluated each quarter and may be adjusted, upward or downward, based on our best judgment after consultation with counsel. No assurance exists that our accruals will not need to be adjusted in the future. 
  The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  Ally Financial Inc.   Form 10-Q 

uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. As a result, we cannot state with confidence how or when threatened or pending legal matters will be resolved and what losses may be incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued for those matters, possibly to a significant degree. 
  On the basis of information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, it is the opinion of management that, except as described in the next paragraph, the eventual outcome of our existing legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. It is possible, however, that an unfavorable resolution of legal matters may be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. 
  Descriptions of our material legal matters follow. In each case, the matter could have material adverse consequences for us, including substantial damages or settlements, injunctions, governmental fines or penalties, and reputational or operational risks. We do not believe, however, that an estimate of reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses in excess of established reserves whether in excess of any related accrual or where no accrual exists can be made for any of these matters, except as described within   Indirect Automotive Finance Matters  . 
  Mortgage Matters 
  We have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that include a broad request for documentation and other information relating to residential mortgage-backed securities issued by our former mortgage subsidiary, Residential Capital, LLC and its subsidiaries (ResCap RMBS). In connection with these requests, the DOJ is investigating potential fraud and other potential legal claims related to ResCap RMBS, including its investigation of potential claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The DOJ is also investigating potential claims under the False Claims Act (FCA) related to representations made by us in connection with investments in Ally made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008 and 2009 regarding certain claims against Residential Capital, LLC or its subsidiaries at that time. 
  We have actively cooperated with the DOJ in connection with its investigations and potential claims. At the request of the DOJ, we entered into an agreement to voluntarily extend the statutes of limitations related to potential FCA claims, but this agreement expired at the end of January 2016. We are currently in advanced settlement discussions to resolve the DOJ s investigations and potential claims. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we established a reserve of   $52 million   within discontinued operations in connection with potential claims related to our discontinued mortgage business. 
  Securities Litigation 
  In October 2016, a purported class action Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund v. Ally Financial Inc. et al, Case No. 16-013616-CZ was filed in the Circuit Court for Wayne County in the State of Michigan. The complaint alleges material misstatements and omissions in connection with Ally s initial public offering in April 2014, including a failure to adequately disclose the severity of rising subprime automotive loan delinquency rates, deficient underwriting measures employed in the origination of subprime automotive loans, and aggressive tactics used with low-income borrowers. The request for relief includes an indeterminate amount of damages, fees, and costs and other remedies. We intend to vigorously defend against this action. 
  Automotive Subprime Matters 
  In October 2014, we received a document request from the SEC in connection with its investigation related to subprime automotive finance and related securitization activities. Separately, in December 2014, we received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting similar information. In May 2015, we received an information request from the New York Department of Financial Services requesting similar information. We have cooperated with each of these agencies with respect to these matters. 
  Indirect Automotive Finance Matters 
  In December 2013, Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank entered into a Consent Order issued by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and a Consent Order jointly submitted with the DOJ and entered by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (  United States v. Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank  , Civil Action No. 13-15180), in each case, pertaining to allegations of discrimination involving the automotive finance business. The Consent Orders require Ally to create a compliance plan addressing, at a minimum, the communication of Ally s expectations of Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) compliance to our automotive dealer clients, maintenance of Ally s existing limits on dealer finance income for contracts acquired by Ally, and monitoring for potential discrimination both at the dealer level and within our portfolio of contracts acquired across all of our automotive dealer clients. Ally formed a compliance committee consisting of certain Ally and Ally Bank directors to oversee Ally s execution of the Consent Orders  terms. Ally is required to meet certain stipulations under the Consent Orders, including a requirement to make monetary payments when ongoing remediation targets are not attained. 
  Since 2013, Ally has expensed approximately   $230 million   for judgments, fines, and monetary remuneration payments to customers related to the Consent Orders. Ally expects to expense an additional   $10 million   to   $15 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016 for remaining monetary remuneration to customers related to the Consent Orders. The Consent Orders terminate, according to their terms, in 2017, and preclude the CFPB and the DOJ from pursuing any potential violations of the ECOA against Ally Financial Inc. or Ally Bank for conduct  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  Ally Financial Inc.   Form 10-Q 

undertaken pursuant to the Consent Orders during the period of the Consent Orders. If the CFPB or the DOJ were to assert that Ally Financial Inc. or Ally Bank is violating the ECOA after the Consent Orders terminate, further legal proceedings could occur. 
  Other Contingencies 
  Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may be subject to potential liability under various other contingent exposures, including indemnification, tax, self-insurance, and other miscellaneous contingencies. We accrue for a contingent exposure when a loss becomes probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are evaluated each quarter and may be adjusted, upward or downward, based on our best judgment. No assurance exists that our accruals will not need to be adjusted in the future, and actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued for those exposures, possibly to a significant degree. On the basis of information currently available, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, it is the opinion of management that the eventual outcome of our other contingent exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
   
  27  .    Subsequent Events 
  Declaration of Quarterly Dividend Payment 
  On   October 18, 2016  , the Ally Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of   $0.08   per share on all common stock. The dividend is payable on   November 15, 2016  , to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2016.

As of January 1, 2015, Ally became subject to the rules implementing the 2010 Basel III capital framework in the United States (U.S. Basel III), which reflect new and higher capital requirements, capital buffers, and new regulatory capital definitions, deductions and adjustments. Certain aspects of U.S. Basel III, including the new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. To assess our capital adequacy against the full impact of U.S. Basel III, we also present "fully phased-in" information that reflects regulatory capital rules that will take effect as of January 1, 2019. Refer to   Note 19   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further information. The following table presents selected regulatory capital data. 

(a) 
    Our fully phased-in capital ratios are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are important to the reader of the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   but should be supplemental to, and not a substitute for, primary GAAP measures. The fully phased-in capital ratios are compared to the transitional capital ratios above. We believe these capital ratios are important because we believe investors, analysts, and banking regulators may assess our capital utilization and adequacy using these ratios. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capital utilization and adequacy on the same basis to other companies in the industry. 
              (b) 
    Tier 1 leverage ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets (which reflects adjustments for disallowed goodwill, certain intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets). 
              (c) 
    Contains deferred tax assets required to be deducted from capital under U.S. Basel III. 
              (d) 
    Risk-weighted assets are defined by regulation and are generally determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet exposures into various risk categories.

Overview 
  Ally Financial Inc. (referred to herein as Ally, Parent, we, our, or us) is a leading digital financial services company offering financial products for consumers, businesses, automotive dealers and corporate clients  .   Founded in 1919, we have over 95 years of experience providing a broad array of financial products and services. We operate as a financial holding company (FHC) and a bank holding company (BHC). Our banking subsidiary, Ally Bank, is an award-winning online bank, and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ally Financial Inc.   with   a distinct brand and relentless focus on customers, offering a variety of deposit and other banking products. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  During 2013 and 2012, certain disposal groups met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. The remaining activity relates to previous discontinued operations for which we continue to have wind-down, legal, and minimal operational costs. Refer to   Note 26   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , titled   Contingencies and Other Risks  , for additional discussion. For all periods presented, the operating results for these operations have been removed from continuing operations. Refer to   Note 3   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for more details. The MD A has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. 
  Change in Reportable Segments 
  As a result of a change in how management views and operates our business, during the first quarter of 2016, we made changes in the composition of our operating segments. Financial information related to our Corporate Finance business is presented as a separate reportable segment. Previously, all such activity was included in Corporate and Other. Additionally, only the activity of our ongoing bulk acquisitions of mortgage loans and other originations and refinancing is presented in Mortgage Finance operations. The activity related to the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio is included in Corporate and Other. Our other operating segments, Automotive Finance operations and Insurance operations, were unchanged. Amounts for 2015 have been adjusted to conform to the current management view.     In connection with the change in operating segments, we defined additional classes of finance receivables and loans: Mortgage Finance and Mortgage   Legacy. Mortgage Finance includes consumer mortgage loans from our ongoing mortgage operations and Mortgage   Legacy includes consumer mortgage loans originated prior to 2009. 
   
  Primary Lines of Business 
  Dealer Financial Services, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance are our primary lines of business. The following table summarizes the operating results excluding discontinued operations of each line of business. Operating results for each of the lines of business are more fully described in the MD A sections that follow. 
  Segment results include cost of funds associated with product offerings. For products originated at Ally Bank, the cost of funds is more beneficial than products originated at other entities as Ally Bank helps fund assets at a lower cost. Noninterest costs associated with deposit gathering activities were $60 million and $185 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and are allocated to each segment based on their relative balance sheet.

Our Dealer Financial Services operations offer a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. Dealer Financial Services consist of two separate reportable segments   Automotive Finance and Insurance operations. 
     Our automotive finance services include providing retail installment sales contracts, loans, and leases, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and other lines of credit to dealers, fleet financing, and vehicle remarketing services. The business is centered on our strong and longstanding relationships with automotive dealers and serves the financial needs of over 18,000 dealers in the United States, including   over 11,500   dealers outside of the General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler) channels, and approximately 4.4 million of their retail customers with a wide range of financial services and insurance products. We believe our dealer-focused business model, with a focus on premium service and deep relationships, value added products and services, and full credit spectrum expertise proven over many credit cycles, makes us the preferred automotive finance company for thousands of our automotive dealer customers. We have developed particularly strong relationships with thousands of dealers resulting from our longstanding relationship with GM as well as relationships with other manufacturers, including Chrysler, providing us with an extensive understanding of the operating needs of these dealers relative to other automotive finance companies. 
  We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel (non-GM/Chrysler) dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs. The Growth channel was established as a formal channel in 2012 to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond our existing relationships that primarily were developed through our role as a captive finance company historically for the GM and Chrysler brands. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler to converting our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have   over 11,500   dealer relationships, of which almost 10,500 are franchised dealers from brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and others; RV dealers; and used vehicle only retailers, which have a national presence. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the national roll-out of our used lease product. During the third quarter of 2016, we added to our vehicle financing capability with the formation of an experienced transportation and equipment finance team, which will provide commercial financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles and equipment such as heavy duty trucks, trailers, buses and cargo vans. Additionally, in August 2016, we strengthened our digital capabilities in automotive financing through the acquisition of technology assets and expertise from Blue Yield, an online automotive lender exchange. This will advance our progress in building a direct-to-consumer option, as well as ultimately driving an end-to-end digital platform. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers. 
  Our Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we provide vehicle service contracts (VSC), maintenance coverage, and guaranteed asset protection (GAP) products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers' vehicle inventories. As part of our continued efforts to diversify, our Insurance operations launched its new flagship vehicle service contract offering, Ally Premier Protection, nationwide for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models in June 2015. Ally Premier Protection is replacing the General Motors Protection Plan nameplate, which will be discontinued in November 2016. 
             
    Our Mortgage Finance operations are limited to the management of a held-for-investment consumer mortgage finance loan portfolio and is primarily comprised of high-quality jumbo and low-to-moderate income (LMI) mortgage loans purchased or originated after January 1, 2009. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we continued to execute bulk purchases of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Year-to-date purchases have totaled   $2.9 billion  . We also plan to introduce a direct-to-consumer mortgage product through a strategic partnership in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
                
    Our Corporate Finance operations primarily provide senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle market companies. The Corporate Finance portfolio is almost entirely comprised of first lien, first out loans. Our primary focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, restructurings, and working capital. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including retail, manufacturing, distribution, service companies, and other specialty sectors such as healthcare and technology. 
                
    Corporate and Other primarily consists of activity related to centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, the amortization of the discount associated with new debt issuances and bond exchanges, and the residual impacts of our corporate funds-transfer pricing (FTP) and asset liability management (ALM) activities. Corporate and Other also includes certain equity investments, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. On June 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TradeKing Group, Inc. (TradeKing),   a digital wealth management company with an online broker/dealer, digital portfolio management platform, and educational content  .   Beginning in June 2016, financial information related to TradeKing is included within Corporate and Other.

During the second quarter of 2016, we launched the Ally CashBack Credit Card. This offering generates fee revenue with no direct credit risk exposure due to the structure of the co-brand relationship, and the related activity is included in Corporate and Other. 
  In addition, as we look ahead, we are well positioned as the marketplace continues to evolve and are working to build on our existing foundation of approximately 5.6 million customers, strong brand, innovative culture, and leading digital platform to expand our products and services and to create an integrated customer experience. In September 2016, we launched our first ever enterprise-wide campaign. Themed "Do It Right," the campaign introduces a broad audience to our full suite of digital financial services and helps crystallize our culture for consumers.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
  The following table summarizes our consolidated operating results excluding discontinued operations for the periods shown. Refer to the operating segment sections of the MD A that follows for a more complete discussion of operating results by line of business. 

n/m = not meaningful 
  We earned net income from continuing operations of   $261 million   and   $865 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $273 million   and   $621 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in the provision primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements, and an increase in other operating expenses primarily as a result of activities associated with the integration of TradeKing and higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit fees. These impacts were partially offset by increases in net financing revenue and other gain on investments. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was due to increases in net financing revenue and other gain on investments, and lower losses on the extinguishment of debt due to debt tender offers in the first half of 2015. This was partially offset by a decrease in gain on mortgage and automotive loans, an increase in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses as a result of higher weather-related losses in 2016, an increase in the provision primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements, and an increase in other operating expenses primarily as a result of activities associated with the integration of TradeKing and higher FDIC deposit fees. 
  Net financing revenue increased by   $26 million   and   $195 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Net financing revenue at our Automotive Finance operations was favorably impacted by higher consumer financing revenue primarily due to the successful execution of our continued strategic focus on expanding risk adjusted returns, as well as higher commercial financing revenue primarily resulting from an increase in dealer floorplan assets. The increase was offset by a decrease in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, primarily resulting from lower lease remarketing gains, and runoff of our GM lease portfolio. Net financing revenue at our Mortgage Finance operations was favorably impacted by portfolio growth as a result of bulk acquisitions of mortgage loans. Net financing revenue at our Corporate Finance operations was favorably impacted by asset growth across all business segments in line with our growth strategy.   Total interest expense     increased     9%   and   7%   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . Interest on deposits increased $31 million and $78 million for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  , due to continued deposit growth. Interest on debt increased $21 million and $53 million for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,

compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily the result of increased LIBOR rates. The increase for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was partially offset by a decrease due to the repayment of higher-cost legacy debt. 
  Net gain on mortgage and automotive loans increased   $2 million   and decreased   $41 million   and for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The gain for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , was primarily due to a sale of a portfolio of troubled debt restructuring (TDR) loans from our consumer mortgage portfolio. 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt decreased   $350 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the execution of tender offers for legacy, high-cost debt in 2015. 
  Other gain on investments, net, was   $52 million   and   $145 million   for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to   $6 million   and   $106 million   for the same periods in 2015. The increases were primarily due to higher realized investment gains in our equity portfolio, with an increase in sales of securities compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  The provision for loan losses was   $258 million   and   $650 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $211 million   and   $467 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The increase in provision for loan losses during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , is primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements both reflecting the changing composition of our retail automotive portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with our underwriting strategy, and higher loan growth within our commercial automotive portfolio year-over-year. The provision for loan losses during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was also impacted by reserve releases within the commercial automotive portfolio in the prior year that did not repeat in 2016. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD A for further discussion. 
  Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses increased   $8 million   and   $48 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to severe hailstorms, which drove higher weather-related losses. 
  Other operating expenses increased   $40 million   and   $61 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the   three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2015. The increases were primarily due to increased expenses from the integration of TradeKing, which was acquired on June 1, 2016, and higher FDIC deposit fees. 
  We recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of   $130 million   and   $336 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $144 million   and   $341 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily driven by lower pretax earnings. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily driven by a tax benefit that resulted from a U.S. tax reserve release related to a prior year federal return that reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. This tax benefit was offset by increases in tax expense attributable to higher pretax earnings and the establishment of a valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards. 
  In calculating the provision for income taxes from continuing operations, we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income on an interim basis. Refer to   Note 1   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further details.

months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Results for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , were unfavorably impacted by an increase in provision for loan losses primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements both due to the changing composition of our portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with our underwriting strategy, as well as a decrease in net operating lease revenue primarily resulting from lower gains per unit and the runoff of our GM lease portfolio. Results for both the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were favorably impacted by higher consumer financing revenue primarily due to the successful execution of our continued strategic focus on expanding risk adjusted returns and an increase in consumer assets, as well as higher commercial financing revenue primarily resulting from an increase in dealer floorplan assets. The increase for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements both due to the changing composition of our portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with our underwriting strategy, as well as a decrease in net operating lease revenue primarily resulting from lower gains per unit and the runoff of our GM lease portfolio. 
  Consumer financing revenue (combined with interest income on consumer loans held-for-sale) increased   $76 million   and   $256 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases are primarily due to improved portfolio yields as a result of the successful execution of our continued strategic focus on expanding risk adjusted returns.  
  Commercial financing revenue increased   $39 million   and   $80 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to higher floorplan assets, an increase in trucks and sport utility vehicles which have higher average prices than cars, higher benchmark rates, and an increase in non-floorplan dealer loan balances. 
  Total net operating lease revenue decreased   20%   and   12%   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The decreases were primarily driven by lower lease remarketing gains driven by lower gains per unit, partially offset by an increase in termination volume. The decreases were also due to lower operating lease revenue as a result of GM portfolio runoff outpacing originations, which were partially offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense on operating lease assets. We recognized remarketing gains of   $62 million   and   $203 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $105 million   and   $282 million   for the same periods in   2015  . 
  Other income increased   14%   and   13%   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to an increase in servicing fee income resulting from higher levels of off-balance sheet retail serviced assets. 
  The provision for loan losses was   $270 million   and   $649 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $201 million   and   $460 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements both due to the changing composition of our portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with our underwriting strategy, higher loan growth within our commercial automotive portfolio year-over-year, as well as reserve releases within the commercial automotive portfolio in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , that did not repeat in 2016.

(a) 
    Represents Ally's internal credit score, incorporating numerous borrower and structure attributes including: FICO  Score; severity and aging of delinquency; number of credit inquiries; loan-to-value ratio; and payment-to-income ratio. We originated an insignificant amount of retail loans classified as Tier D during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , and Tier E during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  .

     As compared to projections a year ago for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, NAALR increased 11 basis points and 9 basis points, respectively, while the average buy rate for retail originations increased by 65 basis points and 60 basis points, respectively, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increases were due to the successful execution of our targeted underwriting strategy to originate consumer automotive assets across a broad risk spectrum, and our continued strategic focus on expanding risk adjusted returns.

The following table presents the total retail and lease origination dollars and percentage mix by channel. 

During the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total consumer originations   decreased     $1.8 billion   and   $4.0 billion  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The expected decreases were due to lower volume from the GM channel and the successful execution of our continued strategic focus on expanding risk adjusted returns over volume levels. The decrease in GM volume during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was partially offset by higher volume in the Growth and Chrysler channels. Growth and Chrysler volume increased   5%   and   8%  , respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015. The increases were driven primarily by expanded offerings and new dealer relationships.

The following table presents the percentage of total retail originations by the loan term in months. 

(a) 
    Excludes RV loans. 
     As we continue the execution of our targeted underwriting strategy to originate consumer automotive assets across a broad risk spectrum, retail originations with a term of 76 months or more represented   16%   and   15%   of total retail originations for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   12%   and   10%   for the same periods in   2015  . Substantially all of the loans originated with a term of 76 months or more during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , were considered to be prime. We define prime retail automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO  Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of 620 or greater. 
  The following table presents the percentage of total retail and lease originations by FICO  Score. 

(a) 
    Unscored are primarily CSG contracts with entities that have no FICO  Score. 
     Originations with a FICO  Score of less than 620 (considered nonprime) represented   10%   and   13%   of total consumer originations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, and   11%   and   13%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. Consumer loans and leases with FICO  Scores of less than 540 continued to comprise only   1%   of total originations for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

    Management uses a combined ratio as a primary measure of underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is indicated by a combined ratio under 100% and is calculated as the sum of all incurred losses and expenses (excluding interest and income tax expense) divided by the total of premiums and service revenues earned and other fee income. 
     Our Insurance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of   $56 million   and   $88 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $40 million   and   $133 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increase for the     three months ended     September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to higher investment income and a decrease in non-weather-related losses driven by lower loss experience for VSC products partially offset by an increase in weather-related losses. The decrease for the   nine months ended   September 30, 2016, was due primarily to severe hailstorms which drove higher weather-related losses. 
  Insurance premiums and service revenue earned was relatively flat for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  . The changes for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were primarily due to increased wholesale earned premium, offset by increased dealer reinsurance participation, and lower VSC volume. 
  Net investment income was   $36 million   and   $104 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $9 million   and   $93 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increases for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were due primarily to higher realized investment gains in the equity portfolio as compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled   $69 million   and   $287 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $61 million   and   $239 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to severe hailstorms, which drove higher weather-related losses. The same higher weather-related losses primarily drove the increase in the combined ratio to   92.5%   and   103.2%   during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   87.7%   and   95.3%   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. Higher weather-related losses were partially offset by a decrease in non-weather-related losses driven by lower loss experience for VSC products.

The following table shows premium and service revenue written by insurance product. 

(a) 
    Reinsurance represents the transfer of premiums and risk from an Ally insurance company to a third party insurance company. 
              (b) 
    VSC revenue is earned over the life of the service contract on a basis proportionate to the anticipated cost pattern. 
              (c) 
    Other finance and insurance includes GAP coverage, excess wear and tear, and other ancillary products. 
     Insurance premiums and service revenue written was   $252 million   and   $711 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $254 million   and   $755 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The decreases for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were due primarily to increased dealer reinsurance participation and lower VSC volume, partially offset by an increase in wholesale premiums. 
  Cash and Investments 
  A significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk tolerance, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.

  Our Mortgage Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of   $8 million   and   $19 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $4 million   and   $2 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increases were primarily due to an increase in net financing revenue driven by portfolio growth as a result of bulk acquisitions of mortgage loans, partially offset by prepayments attributed to the low yield environment. The increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. 
  Net financing revenue   was   $25 million   and   $71 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $17 million   and   $39 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increases in net financing revenue were primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans, partially offset by prepayments attributed to the low yield environment. During the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, we purchased   $467 million   and   $2.9 billion   of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties compared to purchases of   $990 million   and   $3.6 billion   for the same periods in 2015. The increases were partially offset by higher funding costs also driven by portfolio growth. 
  The provision for loan losses   decreased     $2 million   and   $5 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in 2015. The decreases were primarily due to lower portfolio growth compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  Total noninterest expense was   $16 million   and   $48 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $10 million   and   $28 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increases were primarily due to increased expenses to support the growth of the business.

  Results of Operations 
  The following table summarizes the activities of our Corporate Finance operations. The amounts presented are before the elimination of balances and transactions with our reportable segments. 

n/m = not meaningful 
  Our Corporate Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of   $15 million   and   $40 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $14 million   and   $41 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was a result of higher net financing revenue due primarily to asset growth. The higher net financing revenue was partially offset by a decrease in other revenue primarily driven by declines in loan syndication and investment income, and an increase in noninterest expense. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily driven by lower recoveries on nonaccrual loan exposures compared to 2015, increased portfolio level reserves due primarily to higher asset growth, an increase in noninterest expense, and a decrease in other revenue. These items were largely offset by higher net financing revenue primarily due to asset growth. 
  Net financing revenue was   $30 million   and   $87 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $22 million   and   $64 million   for the same periods in 2015. The increases were primarily due to asset growth across all business segments in line with our growth strategy, which resulted in a   43%   increase in the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   September 30, 2015  . 
  Other revenue was   $4 million   and   $14 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $10 million   and   $22 million   for the same periods in 2015. The decreases were due to declines in loan syndication and investment income. 
  The provision for loan losses decreased   $1 million   and increased   $9 million   for the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the three months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to lower provision expense for individually impaired loans during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in recoveries and an increase in non-specific loan loss reserves due to asset growth. The increase for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to higher recoveries on nonaccrual loan exposures in the first quarter of 2015 and increased reserves primarily due to asset growth. The increases were partially offset by lower provisions for individually impaired loans in 2016. 
  Total noninterest expense was   $16 million   and   $49 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $14 million   and   $42 million   for the same periods in 2015. The increases were primarily due to higher expenses to support the growth of the business.

     Loss from continuing operations before income tax expense for Corporate and Other was   $7 million   and   $28 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to income of   $36 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and a loss of   $216 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , was primarily due to an increase in interest expense driven by increased LIBOR rates and an increase in interest on deposits resulting from deposit growth, and an increase in noninterest expense driven primarily by the integration of TradeKing and higher FDIC deposit fees. The decrease in income was partially offset by an increase in other gain on investments as a result of increased sales of securities and a decrease in the provision as a result of lower reserve requirements and lower net charge-offs within the legacy mortgage portfolio. The decrease in loss for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to decreases in loss on extinguishment of debt due to debt tender offers in 2015, partially offset by an increase in interest expense driven by increased LIBOR rates and an increase in interest on deposits resulting from deposit growth. Additionally, the decrease in loss was offset by a decrease in gain on mortgage loans due to sales of legacy TDR mortgage loans in 2015. 
  Interest expense was   $98 million   and   $302 million   for the   three months and nine months ended  , respectively, compared to   $47 million   and   $213 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increases were primarily driven by increased LIBOR rates and increases in interest on deposits resulting from deposit growth. 
  Net loss on mortgage loans was   $6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a net gain of   $68 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to nonrecurring sales of legacy TDR mortgage loans in 2015, which totaled $677 million of unpaid principal balance for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt was   $4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $354 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in loss was due to nonrecurring debt tender offers in 2015. During the first half of 2015, we completed two tender offers to buy back $1.8 billion of our high-coupon debt, resulting in a total loss on extinguishment of debt of $345 million related to these transactions. 
  Other gain on investments was   $28 million   and   $78 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $11 million   and   $49 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increases were due primarily to an increase in sales of securities compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  The provision for loan losses   decreased     $19 million   and   $10 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in 2015, as a result of lower reserve requirements and lower net charge-offs within the legacy mortgage portfolio. 
  Noninterest expense was   $63 million   and   $133 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $32 million   and   $108 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increases were primarily due to increased expenses from the TradeKing integration and higher FDIC deposit fees. 
  Total assets were   $25.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $26.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of the continued runoff of our legacy mortgage portfolio and a decrease in cash due to secured debt maturities. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in deposits and an increase due to the acquisition of TradeKing. At   September 30, 2016  , the total assets of TradeKing were   $299 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , the gross carrying value of the legacy mortgage portfolio was   $2.9 billion  , compared to $3.5 billion at   September 30, 2015  .

Risk Management 
  Managing the risk/reward trade-off is a fundamental component of operating our businesses. Our risk management program is overseen by the Ally Board of Directors (the Board), various risk committees, the executive leadership team, and our associates. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board, together with the Board, sets the risk appetite across our company while the risk committees, executive leadership team, and our associates identify and monitor current and emerging risks and manage those risks to be within our risk appetite. Ally's primary types of risk include credit, lease residual, market, operational, insurance/underwriting, and liquidity. As a result of recent focus by regulators on cross-sell practices and related incentive compensation, Ally management has performed an initial, but detailed review of our cross-sell practices and believes that our existing practices are appropriate, and will be monitored on a continuous basis. For more information on our risk management process, refer to the Risk Management MD A section of our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Loan and Lease Exposure 
  The following table summarizes the exposures from our loan and lease activities. 

(b) 
    Represents the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding loans based on our customary representation and warranty provisions. 
      The risks inherent in our loan and lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing price levels, unemployment levels, and their impact to our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain the majority of our automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. 
  Over the past year, we have experienced growth in our consumer retail automotive loan portfolio and a significant reduction in lease originations. This shift in our portfolio mix has contributed to an increase in provision expense for loan losses. Consumer lease residuals are not included in the allowance for loan losses as changes in the expected residual values on consumer leases are included in depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease. However, our risk to future fluctuations in used vehicle values has diminished as our lease assets have declined materially and will continue to decline as the number of leases terminating currently is significantly larger than the number of new leases being originated. All leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, while only those loans that default, and where we take possession of the vehicle, are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. Operating lease assets decreased   $3.6 billion   to   $12.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $16.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .

Credit Risk Management 
  Credit risk is defined as the potential failure to receive payments due from an obligor in accordance with contractual obligations. Therefore, credit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by several groups and functions throughout the organization, including enterprise and line of business committees and the risk management function. Together, they oversee the credit decisioning and management processes, and monitor credit risk exposures to ensure they are managed in a safe-and-sound manner and are within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit risk management practices, and directly reports its findings to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board on a regular basis. 
  To mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across all lines of business, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintain an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures to monitor compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Our consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to ensure that we can withstand a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and volume based limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (e.g., nonprime) in support of our risk appetite. 
  We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers and the aggregate portfolio of borrowers either within a designated geographic region or a particular product or industry segment. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends.   Refer to   Note 7   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  Additionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include extension of the loan maturity date and rewriting the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of our participation in certain governmental programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. Numerous initiatives are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates. 
  Furthermore, we manage our counterparty credit exposure based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies, we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe-and-sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types, including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, financial futures, cash balances (e.g., due from depository institutions, restricted accounts, and cash equivalents), and investment in debt securities. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to     Note 20   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  We closely monitor macro-economic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our credit risk. During the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand. The labor market remained stable during the period, with nonfarm payrolls increasing, offset by the annual unemployment rate rising to 5% as of   September 30, 2016  . Within the U.S. automotive market, new light vehicle sales flattened, resulting in a 17.5 million annual pace for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and we experienced downward pressure on used vehicle values. 
  On-balance Sheet Portfolio 
  Our on-balance sheet portfolio includes both finance receivables and loans and loans held-for-sale. At   September 30, 2016  , this primarily included   $100.9 billion   of automotive finance receivables and loans and   $10.9 billion   of mortgage finance receivables and loans. Our ongoing Mortgage Finance operations are limited to the management of our held-for-investment mortgage loan portfolio. During the three months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we continued to execute bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans.

The following table presents our total on-balance sheet consumer and commercial finance receivables and loans. 

Total on-balance sheet loans outstanding at   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $3.3 billion   to   $115.0 billion   from   December 31, 2015  , reflecting an   increase   of   $1.7 billion   in the commercial portfolio and an   increase   of   $1.6 billion   in the consumer portfolio. The increase in commercial on-balance sheet loans outstanding was primarily driven by the growth of wholesale floorplan finance receivables and the ongoing demand for automotive dealer term loans. The increase in consumer on-balance sheet loans was primarily driven by the execution of bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans totaling   $2.9 billion   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Total TDRs outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , increased $15 million to $640 million from   December 31, 2015  . Refer to   Note 7   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  Total nonperforming loans at   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $73 million   to   $753 million   from   December 31, 2015  , reflecting an   increase   of   $39 million   of consumer nonperforming loans and an   increase   of   $34 million   of commercial nonperforming loans. The increase in total nonperforming loans from December 31, 2015, was primarily due to the changing composition of the consumer automotive portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with Ally s underwriting strategy, combined with the downgrade of three accounts within the commercial and industrial portfolio. Nonperforming loans include finance receivables and loans on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or when full collection is determined not to be probable. Refer to   Note 1   to the Annual   Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  The following table includes consumer and commercial net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios. 

(a) 
    Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category. 
     Net charge-offs were   $213 million   and   $544 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $161 million   and   $411 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increases during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were driven by the changing composition of the consumer automotive portfolio to a more profitable mix

of business consistent with Ally s underwriting strategy; lower recoveries on gross charge-offs due to higher unpaid principal balances at the time of charge-off and lower used vehicle values; and the seasoning of consumer automotive accounts now entering their prime loss periods. 
  The   Consumer Credit Portfolio   and   Commercial Credit Portfolio   discussions that follow relate to consumer and commercial finance receivables and loans recorded at gross carrying value. Finance receivables and loans recorded at gross carrying value have an associated allowance for loan losses. 
  Consumer Credit Portfolio 
  During the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the credit performance of the consumer portfolio remained strong and reflects both the continued execution of our underwriting strategy to originate consumer automotive assets across a broad risk spectrum, including higher LTV, used, nonprime, extended term, Growth channel, and nonsubvented finance receivables and loans and our continued execution of bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans. For information on our consumer credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to   Note 1   to the Annual   Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  The following table includes consumer finance receivables and loans recorded at gross carrying value. 

(b) 
    Includes $66 million of fair value adjustment for loans in hedge accounting relationships at both   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . Refer to   Note 20   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
      Total consumer outstanding finance receivables and loans   increased     $1.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   December 31, 2015  . The increase in consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was primarily due to growth in the Mortgage Finance portfolio due to the execution of bulk loan purchases, which outpaced total consumer mortgage portfolio runoff. The increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily related to our loan originations, which outpaced portfolio runoff, largely offset by the completion of $4.2 billion in loan sales and securitizations of higher quality prime assets. 
  Total consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $39 million   to   $642 million   from   December 31, 2015  , reflecting an increase of $67 million of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans and a decrease of $28 million of consumer mortgage nonperforming finance receivables and loans. The increase in nonperforming consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily due to the changing composition of the portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with Ally s underwriting strategy. The decrease in nonperforming consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans was primarily due to continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment, including increases in the house price index and continued low interest rates, as well as the liquidation of certain nonperforming accounts. Refer to   Note 7   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were   0.8%   at both   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Consumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more decreased $63 million to $1.8 billion at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   December 31, 2015  , primarily resulting from seasonality but also due to our collections efforts (e.g., customer contact strategies and tools such as email, text messaging and chat as well as loan extensions and rewrites).

We monitor our consumer loan portfolio for concentration risk across the geographies in which we lend. The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in Texas and California, which represented an aggregate of 24.1% and 23.5% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily comprised of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally. 
  Repossessed and Foreclosed Assets 
  We classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed (included in other assets on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet  ) when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to   Note 1   to the Annual   Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Repossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations at   September 30, 2016  , increased $7 million to $129 million from   December 31, 2015  . Foreclosed mortgage assets at   September 30, 2016  , increased $3 million to $13 million from   December 31, 2015  . 
  Commercial Credit Portfolio 
  During the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained strong, as nonperforming finance receivables and loans remained low and no net charge-offs were realized. For information on our commercial credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to   Note 1   to the Annual   Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  The following table includes total commercial finance receivables and loans reported at gross carrying value. 

(b) 
    Other commercial primarily includes senior secured commercial lending. 
     Total commercial finance receivables and loans outstanding   increased     $1.8 billion   from   December 31, 2015  , to   $39.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to the growth of wholesale floorplan finance receivables and the ongoing demand for automotive dealer term loans, as well as the growth in our Corporate Finance portfolio in line with our business strategy. 
  Total commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were   $111 million   at   September 30, 2016  , reflecting an   increase   of   $34 million   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of three accounts within the commercial and industrial portfolio. However, nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans remained relatively stable at   0.3%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.2%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The following table includes total commercial net charge-offs from finance receivables and loans at gross carrying value and related ratios.

Commercial Real Estate 
  The commercial real estate portfolio consists of finance receivables and loans issued primarily to automotive dealers. Commercial real estate finance receivables and loans were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The following table presents the percentage of total commercial real estate finance receivables and loans by state concentration. These finance receivables and loans are reported at gross carrying value. 

Commercial Criticized Exposure 
  Finance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are deemed criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss. 
  The following table presents the percentage of total commercial criticized finance receivables and loans by industry concentration. These finance receivables and loans within our automotive and Corporate Finance portfolios are reported at gross carrying value. 

Total criticized exposures increased   $222 million   from   December 31, 2015  , to   $2.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to the Corporate Finance portfolio and is in line with the overall growth in Corporate Finance loan balances.

     The allowance for consumer loan losses at   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $89 million   compared to   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher reserve requirements reflecting the changing composition of the consumer automotive portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with Ally s underwriting. 
  The allowance for commercial loan losses   increased     $27 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to higher loan balances.

  The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by product type. 

Provision for Loan Losses 
  The following table summarizes the provision for loan losses by product type. 

The provision for consumer loan losses   increased     $48 million   and   $120 million   for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , is primarily due to higher net charge-offs and higher overall reserve requirements both reflecting the changing composition of the consumer automotive portfolio to a more profitable mix of business consistent with Ally s underwriting strategy. The increases were partially offset by both lower reserve requirements and net charge-offs within Mortgage   Legacy, as well as lower portfolio growth year-over-year within Mortgage Finance.

The provision for commercial loan losses was $4 million and $16 million for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to $5 million and a net credit of $47 million for the same periods in   2015  . The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to reserve releases that did not repeat. 
  Lease Residual Risk Management 
  We are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer lease portfolio. This lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. For information on our valuation of automotive lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled   Critical Accounting Estimates       Valuation of Automotive Lease Assets and Residuals   within the MD A included in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Lease Vehicle Terminations and Remarketing 
  The following table summarizes the volume of lease terminations and average gain per vehicle over recent periods, as well as our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination, stated as a percentage of total lease vehicle disposals. The actual gain per vehicle on lease terminations varies based upon the type of vehicle. 

The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , increased   24%   and   21%  , compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increases in the number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , reflect a shift of incentive programs from two-year leases in 2012 towards three-year leases in 2013. In 2018 and beyond, our termination volumes, and therefore our residual risk, should decrease significantly as a direct result of lower GM lease originations. 
  Average gain per vehicle decreased for the   three months and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  . The decreases for the three months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were due to declining used vehicle values which were more pronounced in the car market, and adjustments to depreciation expense based on changes in expected residual values at lease termination. This trend is expected to continue in the near term. For more information on our investment in operating leases, refer to   Note 8   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , and   Note 1   to the Annual   Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  Lease Portfolio Mix 
  We monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases. The following table presents the mix of leased vehicles by type, based on volume of units. 

Market Risk 
  Our automotive financing, mortgage, and insurance activities give rise to market risk representing the potential loss in the fair value of assets or liabilities and earnings caused by movements in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, market perceptions of credit risk, and other market fluctuations that affect the value of securities, assets held-for-sale, and operating leases.   We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates related to financing, investing, and cash management activities.   More specifically, we have entered into contracts to provide financing and to retain various assets related to securitization activities all of which are exposed in varying degrees to changes in value due to movements in interest rates.   Interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between assets and the related liabilities used for funding. We enter into various financial instruments, including derivatives, to maintain the desired level of exposure to the risk of interest rate and other fluctuations.   Refer to   Note 20   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further information.

We are also exposed to some foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk. 
  We also have exposure to equity price risk, primarily in our Insurance operations, which invests in equity securities that are subject to price risk influenced by capital market movements. We enter into equity options to economically hedge our exposure to the equity markets. Additionally, we have exposure to equity price risk related to certain share-based compensation programs. We enter into prepaid equity forward contracts to economically hedge a portion of this exposure. 
  Although the diversity of our activities from our complementary lines of business may partially mitigate market risk, we also actively manage this risk. We maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rates, foreign-currency exchange rates, equity price risks, and any of their related hedge positions. Positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. 
  Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis 
  Interest rate risk represents our most significant exposure to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect future earnings. We use net financing revenue sensitivity analysis as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate sensitivities of our financial instruments. 
  We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net financing revenue, which take into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. Simulations are used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rates scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulation incorporates contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of deposits with noncontractual maturities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates.     Relative to our baseline forecast, which is based on the implied forward curve, our net financing revenue over the next twelve months would decrease by $27 million if interest rates remain unchanged. 
  The net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following twelve months. A number of alternative rate scenarios are tested, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to both current spot rates and the market forward curve. We also evaluate nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types  . 
  Our twelve-month pretax net financing revenue sensitivity based on the market forward-curve was as follows. 

(a) 
    Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months. 
     Although implied forward rates have declined since December 31, 2015, our earnings exposure has improved when measured by upward interest rate shocks. The shift to an asset sensitive position is primarily due to a reduction in market based funding as non-maturing retail deposits have continued to grow. In addition, higher variable rate commercial loan balances and a net decline in off balance sheet exposure have contributed to the position as of September 30, 2016. The adverse change in the downward interest rate shock scenario is primarily driven by increased prepayment sensitivity across our mortgage loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios as the portfolios continue to grow. The downward shock scenario is impacted by the current low rate environment, which limits absolute declines in short-term rates in a shock scenario. 
  The future repricing behavior of retail deposit liabilities, particularly non-maturity deposits, remains a significant driver of interest rate sensitivity. The sustained low interest rate environment increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. Our interest rate risk models use dynamic assumptions driven by a number of factors, including the overall level of interest rates and the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates to project changes in our retail deposit offered rates. Our interest rate risk metrics currently assume a long-term retail deposit beta of greater than 75%. We believe our deposits may ultimately be less sensitive to interest rate changes, which will reduce our overall exposure to rising rates. Assuming a long-term retail deposit beta of 50% (vs. current assumption of greater than 75%) would result in a consolidated interest rate risk position that is asset sensitive.

Our pro-forma rate sensitivity assuming a 50% deposit pass-through based on the forward-curve was as follows. 

(a) 
    Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months. 
     Our asset sensitive risk position is reduced slightly by the net impact of off balance sheet hedging positions which continue to generate positive financing revenue in the current interest rate environment. This position includes both receive-fixed interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate liabilities, including legacy unsecured debt, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain retail automotive assets. The size, maturity and mix of our hedging activities change frequently as we adjust our broader asset and liability management objectives.

Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital 
  Overview 
  The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure our ability to meet loan and lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, borrowing facilities, repurchase agreements, as well as funding programs supported by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB). 
  We define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution's financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet its financial obligations, and to withstand unforeseen liquidity stress events. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk helps ensure an organization's preparedness to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions. 
  The Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) is chaired by the Corporate Treasurer and is responsible for overseeing our liquidity, funding strategies and plans, contingency funding plans, and counterparty credit exposure arising from financial transactions. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within prudent operating guidelines and targets approved by ALCO and the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Ally Board of Directors. Liquidity risk is managed for the parent company, Ally Bank, and the consolidated organization. The parent company and Ally Bank prepare periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds with oversight and monitoring by the Liquidity Risk group within Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury executes our funding strategies and manages liquidity under baseline economic projections as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. 
  Funding Strategy 
  Liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in different segments of the capital markets. Our funding strategy largely focuses on the development of diversified funding sources across a broad investor base to meet liquidity needs throughout different market cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, wholesale and retail unsecured debt, FHLB advances, and whole-loan sales. We also supplement these funding sources with a modest amount of short-term borrowings, including demand notes and repurchase arrangements. The diversity of our funding sources enhances funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one source, and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles. In addition, we further distinguish our funding strategy between Ally Bank funding and parent company (nonbank) funding. 
  We diversify Ally Bank's overall funding in order to reduce reliance on any one source of funding and to achieve a well-balanced funding portfolio across a spectrum of risk, duration, and cost of funds characteristics. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB. 
  Since 2009, a significant portion of asset originations have been directed to Ally Bank in order to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This has allowed us to use bank funding for a wider array of our automotive finance assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise. On March 7, 2016, Ally Bank received approval from the Federal Reserve to become a state member bank. Ally Bank is now regulated by the FRB through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, as well as the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. In addition, in connection with the application for membership in the Federal Reserve System, Ally Bank made commitments to the FRB relating to capital, liquidity, and business plan requirements. These commitments are consistent with the prior requirements under the now-terminated Capital and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement with the FDIC, including the requirement to maintain capital at a level such that Ally Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio is at least   15%  . For this purpose, the leverage ratio is determined in accordance with the FRB's regulations related to capital maintenance. Continuation of the Ally Bank Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement could further restrict balance sheet growth within Ally Bank and could unfavorably impact liquidity at AFI. 
  Liquidity Risk Management 
  Multiple metrics are used to frame the level of liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, and identify related trends. These metrics include coverage ratios and stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that ensure prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist senior management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk management accountabilities.

We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed credit facility capacity that, taken together, would allow us to operate and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations in the event that market-wide disruptions and enterprise-specific events disrupt normal access to funding. The available liquidity is held at various entities and considers regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities. The following table summarizes our total available liquidity. 

(a) 
    Parent company liquidity is defined as our consolidated operations less Ally Bank and the regulated subsidiaries of Ally Insurance's holding company.  
              (b) 
    Committed funding facilities include both consolidated and nonconsolidated facilities. 
              (c) 
    Funding from committed secured facilities is available on request in the event excess collateral resides in certain facilities or is available to the extent incremental collateral is available and contributed to the facilities. 
              (d) 
    To optimize cash and secured facility capacity between entities, the parent company lends cash to Ally Bank on occasion under an intercompany loan agreement. Amounts outstanding on this loan are repayable to the parent company upon demand, subject to a five day notice period. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , assuming a long-term capital markets stress, we expect that our available liquidity would allow us to continue to fund all planned loan originations and meet all of our financial obligations for approximately 36 months, assuming no issuance of unsecured debt or term securitizations. 
  In addition, our estimated Modified Liquidity Coverage Ratio exceeded 100% at   September 30, 2016  . Refer to   Note 19   to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our liquidity requirements. 
  Ally Bank 
  Ally Bank gathers retail deposits directly from customers through direct banking via the internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. These retail deposits provide our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations with a stable and low-cost funding source. 
  Optimizing bank funding continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We have made significant progress in migrating asset originations to Ally Bank and growing our retail deposit base since becoming a BHC in December 2008. Retail deposit growth is a key driver of optimizing funding costs and reducing reliance on capital markets based funding. We believe deposits provide a stable, low-cost source of funds that are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels. Current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including CDs, savings accounts, money market accounts, IRA deposit products, as well as an interest checking product. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries. 
  The following table shows Ally Bank's number of accounts and deposit balances by type as of the end of each quarter since   2015  . 

(a) 
    Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits (excluding intercompany deposits). 
     During   the first nine months of 2016  , the deposit base at Ally Bank grew   $9.3 billion  . The growth in total deposits has been primarily attributable to our retail deposit portfolio, particularly within our savings and money market accounts. Strong retention rates and customer acquisition continue to drive growth in retail deposits. Refer to   Note 12   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for a summary of deposit funding by type.

In addition to building a larger deposit base, we continue to remain active in the securitization markets to finance our Ally Bank automotive loan products. Securitization has proven to be a reliable and cost-effective funding source. Additionally, for retail automotive loans and lease notes, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and leases for the life of the underlying asset, creating an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk. We manage secured funding execution risk by maintaining a diverse investor base and available committed credit facility capacity. Ally Bank has exclusive access to private committed funding facilities, the largest of which is a syndicated credit facility of sixteen lenders shared with the parent company. This facility can fund automotive retail and dealer floorplan loans, as well as leases. During March 2016, this facility was renewed with   $3.0 billion   of capacity and the maturity was extended to   March 2018  . In July 2016, $400 million of the commitment under this facility was transferred from Ally Bank to AFI (parent company), which reduced the Ally Bank capacity to   $2.6 billion  . Our ability to access the unused capacity in the secured facility depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. 
  Ally Bank also has access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage and commercial real estate automotive finance receivables and loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , Ally Bank had pledged   $14.5 billion   of assets to the FHLB resulting in   $10.2 billion   in total funding capacity with   $8.4 billion   of debt outstanding. 
  In addition, Ally Bank has access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The financial instruments sold in repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , Ally Bank had   no   debt outstanding under repurchase agreements. 
  Additionally, Ally Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the Federal Reserve Bank is not a primary source of funding for day to day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. Ally Bank has assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank totaling   $2.4 billion  . Ally Bank had   no   debt outstanding with the Federal Reserve as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Parent Company (Nonbank) Funding 
  Funding sources at the parent company generally consist of long-term unsecured debt, unsecured retail term notes, floating rate demand notes, committed credit facilities, asset-backed securitizations, and a modest amount of short-term borrowings. The parent company's ability to access unused capacity in secured facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. 
  We continue to remain active in the securitization markets to finance our automotive loan portfolios. During   the third quarter of   2016  , we raised   $1.5 billion   through the completion of two securitization transactions backed by retail automotive loans. In addition, we have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs generally consist of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed-maturity dates. There were   $440 million   of retail term notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We obtain unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our Demand Notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. Demand Notes outstanding were   $3.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Refer to   Note 13   and   Note 14   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt, respectively. 
  Secured funding continues to be a significant source of financing at the parent company. The total capacity in our committed funding facilities is provided by banks and other financial institutions through private transactions. The committed secured funding facilities can be revolving in nature and allow for additional funding during the commitment period, or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the closing date. At   September 30, 2016  , all of our   $14.5 billion   of committed capacity was revolving. Our revolving facilities generally have an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $11.5 billion   of committed funding capacity from revolving facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days. The parent company's largest facility is a revolving syndicated credit facility secured by automotive receivables. This facility was renewed in March 2016 by a syndicate of sixteen lenders with   $8.0 billion   in capacity and the maturity was extended until   March 2018  . In July 2016, $400 million of the commitment under this facility was transferred from Ally Bank to AFI (parent company), which increased the parent company capacity to   $8.4 billion  . In the event this facility is not renewed at maturity, the outstanding debt will be repaid over time as the underlying collateral amortizes. At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $6.6 billion   outstanding under this facility. In addition to our syndicated revolving credit facility, we also maintain various bilateral and multilateral secured credit facilities that fund our Automotive Finance operations. These are primarily private securitization facilities that fund a specific pool of automotive assets. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the parent company had debt of   $659 million   outstanding under repurchase agreements.

Recent Funding Developments 
  During   the first nine months of 2016  , we accessed the public and private markets to execute secured funding transactions, whole-loan sales, unsecured funding transactions, and funding facility renewals totaling   $24.1 billion  . Key funding highlights from January 1,   2016   to date were as follows: 
             
    Ally Financial Inc. closed, renewed, increased, and/or extended   $15.7 billion   in U.S. credit facilities during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The automotive credit facility renewal amount includes the March 2016 refinancing of   $11.0 billion   for our shared credit facilities at both the parent company and Ally Bank with a syndicate of sixteen lenders. The   $11.0 billion   capacity is secured by retail, lease, and dealer floorplan automotive assets and is allocated to two separate facilities; one is an   $8.4 billion   facility which is available to the parent company, while the other is a   $2.6 billion   facility available to Ally Bank. Both facilities mature in   March 2018  . 
                
    Ally Financial Inc. continued to access the public and private term asset-backed securitization markets raising   $4.8 billion   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , with   $2.3 billion   and   $2.5 billion   raised by Ally Bank and the parent company, respectively. Included in Ally Bank's funding for   2016   are two off-balance sheet securitizations backed by retail automotive loans, which raised   $1.5 billion  . In addition, Ally Bank raised   $2.7 billion   related to whole-loan sales of retail automotive loans during   the first nine months of 2016  . 
                
    In April 2016, Ally Financial Inc. accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised   $900 million   through the issuance of   $600 million   and   $300 million   of aggregate principal amount of senior and subordinated notes, respectively. 
     Funding Sources 
  The following table summarizes our sources of funding and the amount outstanding under each category for the periods shown. 

(b) 
    Excludes fair value adjustment as described in   Note 20   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
              (c) 
    Bank deposits include retail, brokered, mortgage escrow, and other deposits. Parent deposits include dealer deposits. Intercompany deposits are not included. 
     Refer to   Note 14   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for a summary of the scheduled maturity of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Flows 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $3.6 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.0 billion   for the same period in   2015  . The change was primarily a result of a   $0.5 billion   increase of cash outflows from other assets and a   $0.4 billion   decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt. This was partially offset by a   $0.5 billion   gain on sale of subsidiaries in 2015. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $2.8 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7.0 billion   for the same period in   2015  . The change was a result of an increase in net cash inflows from purchases, sales, maturities and repayment of available-for-sale securities of   $2.4 billion  . Also contributing to the change was an increase in proceeds from sales of finance receivables and loans of   $2.4 billion   and an increase in net cash inflows from operating lease activity of   $1.8 billion  . This was partially offset by   $1.0 billion   in proceeds from the sale of a business unit in 2015, purchases of   $0.7 billion   of held-to maturity securities, an increase of   $0.4 billion   in net cash used due to the purchase of nonmarketable equity investments, and   $0.3 billion   due to the acquisition of TradeKing.

Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   $2.9 billion  , compared to   $2.7 billion   net cash provided for the same period in   2015  . The change in financing activities was primarily due to cash used for the repayment of long-term debt exceeding cash from issuance of long-term debt by   $9.5 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . This is compared to cash provided by the issuance of long-term debt exceeding the repayment of long-term debt by   $0.4 billion   for the same period in 2015. This was partially offset by an increase in deposits of   $3.4 billion   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, and a   $1.3 billion   decrease in dividends paid on preferred stock. 
  Capital Planning and Stress Tests 
  As a BHC with   $50 billion   or more of consolidated assets, Ally is required to conduct periodic company-run stress tests, is subject to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), and must submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. 
  Ally s capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. The capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios under baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB must approve Ally's capital plan before Ally may take any capital action. Even with an approved capital plan, Ally must seek the approval of the FRB before making a capital distribution if, among other factors, Ally would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. 
  On April 5, 2016, we submitted the results of our semi-annual stress test and our annual capital plan to the FRB. On June 23, 2016, we publicly disclosed summary results of the stress test under the most severe scenario in accordance with regulatory requirements. On June 29, 2016, we received a non-objection to our capital plan from the FRB, including the proposed capital actions contained in our submission. The proposed capital actions include a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.08   per share of our common stock, subject to quarterly approval by the Board of Directors, and the ability to repurchase up to   $700 million   of our common stock from time to time through the second quarter of 2017. In addition, we submitted to the FRB the results of our company-run mid-year stress test conducted under multiple macroeconomic scenarios and disclosed the results of this stress test under the most severe scenario on October 5, 2016, in accordance with regulatory requirements. 
  On July 18, 2016, the Ally Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of   $0.08   per share on all common stock. The dividend was paid on August 15, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 1, 2016. On October 18, 2016, the Ally Board of Directors declared a second quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.08 per share on all common stock. Refer to   Note 27   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further information regarding this common share dividend. Additionally, the Ally Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $700 million beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and continuing through the second quarter of 2017. During the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased   $159 million  , or   8,297,653   shares of common stock under this program, which reduced total shares outstanding by approximately 1.7%. We had   475,469,882   shares of common stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  In September 2016, the FRB proposed a rule that would, among other things, revise the capital plan rule to no longer subject large and noncomplex firms, including Ally, to the provisions of the existing rule whereby the FRB may object to a capital plan on the basis of qualitative deficiencies in the firm s capital planning process. Under the proposed rule, the qualitative assessment of Ally s capital plan would be conducted outside of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, through the supervisory review process, and Ally s reporting requirements would be modified to reduce certain reporting burdens related to capital planning and stress testing. The proposed rule would take effect for the 2017 capital planning cycle. 
  Regulatory Capital 
  Refer to   Note 19   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   and   Selected Financial Data   within this MD A. 
  Credit Ratings 
  The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money market investors).

Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations rate substantially all our debt. The following table summarizes our current ratings and outlook by the respective nationally recognized rating agencies. 

(a) 
    Fitch affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BB+, affirmed our short-term rating of B, and maintained a Stable outlook on September 28, 2016. 
              (b) 
    Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Ba3 from B1, affirmed our short-term rating of Not Prime, and changed the outlook to Stable on October 20, 2015. Effective December 1, 2014, we determined to not renew our contractual arrangement with Moody's related to their providing of our corporate family, senior debt, and short-term ratings. Notwithstanding this, Moody's has determined to continue to provide these ratings on a discretionary basis. However, Moody's has no obligation to continue to provide these ratings, and could cease doing so at any time. 
              (c) 
    Standard   Poor's affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BB+, affirmed our short-term rating of B, and changed the outlook from Positive to Stable on October 12, 2016. 
              (d) 
    DBRS upgraded our short-term rating to R-3 from R-4, upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB (Low) from BB (High), and changed the outlook to Stable on all ratings on May 2, 2016.

  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  We identified critical accounting estimates that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
  Our most critical accounting estimates are as follows. 
             
    Allowance for loan losses 
                
    Valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals 
                
    Fair value of financial instruments 
                
    Legal and regulatory reserves 
                
    Determination of provision for income taxes 
     During 2016, we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the above estimates from what was described in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Refer to   Note 1   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting.

  Forward-looking Statements 
  The foregoing Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other portions of this Form 10-Q contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable federal securities laws. 
  The words  expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   forecast,   initiative,   objective,   plan,   goal,   project,   outlook,   priorities,   target,   intend,   evaluate,   pursue,   seek,   may,   would,   could,   should,   believe,   potential,   continue,  or the negative of any of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements herein, other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation statements about future events and financial performance, are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. 
  While these statements represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and we believe these judgments are reasonable, these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and Ally's actual results may differ materially. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider all uncertainties and risks described in the most recent reports on Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Forms 10-K and 10-Q for Ally, or discussed in this report, including those under Item 1A, Risk Factors, as well as those provided in any subsequent SEC filings. Forward-looking statements apply only as of the date they are made, and Ally undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date the forward-looking statement are made. Such factors include, among others, the following: maintaining the mutually beneficial relationship between Ally and GM, and Ally and Chrysler, and our ability to further diversify our business; our ability to maintain relationships with automotive dealers; the significant regulation and restrictions that we are subject to as a BHC and a FHC; the potential for deterioration in the residual value of off-lease vehicles; disruptions in the market in which we fund our operations, with resulting negative impact on our liquidity; changes in our accounting assumptions that may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, which could result in an impact on earnings; changes in our credit ratings; changes in economic conditions, currency exchange rates or political stability in the markets in which we operate; and changes in the existing or the adoption of new laws, regulations, policies or other activities of governments, agencies and similar organizations (including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III). 
  Use of the term  loans  describes products associated with direct and indirect lending activities of Ally s operations. The specific products include retail installment sales contracts, lines of credit, leases or other financing products. The term  originate  refers to Ally s purchase, acquisition or direct origination of various  loan  products.

  Controls and Procedures 
  Ally Financial Inc.   Form 10-Q 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer evaluated, with the participation of our management, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Ally have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

Exhibit 

Exhibit 12 
  Ally Financial Inc. 
    
  Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges   

           (a) 
    During 2013 and 2012, certain disposal groups met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. For all periods presented, the operating results for these operations have been removed from continuing operations. We report these businesses separately as discontinued operations in the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . Refer to   Note 3   to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for further discussion of our discontinued operations. All reported periods of the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges exclude discontinued operations. 
              (b) 
    Amount for 2015 includes a $1,185 million reduction (increase) to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) related to a redemption of our Series G Preferred Stock in April 2015, a $22 million reduction (increase) to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) related to a repurchase of our Series A Preferred shares in May 2015, and a $1,178 million reduction (increase) to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) related to the redemption of our remaining Series G Preferred Stock in December 2015. Amount for 2013 includes a $240 million reduction to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) related to a repurchase of mandatorily convertible preferred stock held by U.S. Department of Treasury and elimination of share adjustment right on November 20, 2013. Effective   May 16, 2016  , we redeemed the remaining shares outstanding of our Series A Preferred Stock. 
              (c) 
    The ratio indicates a less than one-to-one coverage for the year ended December 31, 2011. Earnings available for fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 were inadequate to cover fixed charges. The deficient amount for the ratio was   $183 million   for the year ended December 31, 2011.
