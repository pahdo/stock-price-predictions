  CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note
1   Business Organization   

These
financial statements represent the financial statements of National Waste Management Holdings, Inc. ( NWMH ) and its
wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Sand/Land of Florida Enterprises, Inc. ( Sand/Land ), Waste Recovery Enterprises,
LLC ( WRE ) and Gateway Rolloff Services, LP ( Gateway ). NWMH, Sand/Land, WRE and Gateway are collectively
referred to herein as the  Company . The Company changed its name from Kopjaggers, Inc. to National Waste Management
Holdings, Inc. effective October 31, 2014.  

On
June 16, 2014, pursuant to a share exchange agreement, NWMH merged with Sand/Land, a Florida corporation formed as a S-Corporation
under the laws of the State of Florida on August 15, 1986, in which the existing stockholders of Sand/Land exchanged all of their
issued and outstanding shares of common stock for 9,490,000 shares of common stock of NWMH (the  Reverse Merger ).
After the consummation of the Reverse Merger, stockholders of Sand/Land owned 47.45% of NWMH s outstanding common stock.  

As
a result of the Reverse Merger, Sand/Land became a wholly owned subsidiary of NWMH. For accounting purposes, the Reverse Merger
was treated as a reverse acquisition with Sand/Land as the acquirer and NWMH as the acquired party.  

WRE
and Gateway were related party acquisitions. They were acquired on October 15, 2015 and December 1, 2015, respectively. See Notes
8 and 10,  Related Party Transactions  and  Acquisitions , respectively.  

Sand/Land
is a solid waste management company headquartered in Central Florida, currently operating a licensed Construction   Demolition
landfill. The Company s primary operations are based near Tampa, Florida.  

WRE
is a waste management company that offers trash collection services, roll-off services and a full-service transfer station. The
Company also offers wood grinding, demolition, mulch and gravel services. The Company s primary operations are based near
Binghamton, New York. The Company was founded in 1998 and principally serves the northeastern U.S. industrial and residential
markets.  

Gateway
offers commercial and residential dumpster service and roll-off boxes for construction and cleanup projects specializing in the
removal of debris, garbage, waste, hauling construction and demolition debris, focused on servicing general contractors, new home
builders, reconstruction, renovation, landscaping and home improvement professionals. The Company s primary operations are
based near Tampa, Florida.  

The
Company, as a consolidated entity, is a full service solid waste management company headquartered near Tampa, Florida with operations
in Florida and New York.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The Consolidated financial statements include the operations of
Sand/Land, WRE and Gateway, together, NWMH.

  CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note
2   Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)   

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

For
certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, interest payable, advances payable
and notes payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities and associated market
interest rates.  

The
Company adopted ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  ASC 820-10 defines fair value, and establishes
a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify
as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period between the origination
of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy
are defined as follows:  

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted
prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level
                                         2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
                                         in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
                                         directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.   

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable
and significant to the fair value measurement.   

The
Company did not identify any non-recurring assets and liabilities that are required to be presented in the balance sheets at fair
value in accordance with ASC 815.  

In
February 2007, the FASB issued ASC 825-10  Financial Instruments.  ASC 825-10 permits entities to choose to measure
many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option
has been elected are reported in earnings.  

The
carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these items. The
carrying amounts of long-term debt, capital leases and preferred stock approximate fair value due to the interest rates and dividend
yields associated with such instruments. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgment, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect
these estimates. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it utilize derivative
instruments in the management of foreign exchange, commodity price, or interest rate market risks.

Revenue
and Cost Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable
and earned when all the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the sales price is
fixed or determinable; (iii) collectability is reasonably assured; and (iv) goods have been shipped and/or services rendered.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

For
purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash and cash equivalents to be all highly liquid deposits with maturities
of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value.  

The
Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at various financial institutions where they are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. The balances of these accounts from time to time may exceed federally insured limits.
The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.  

Accounts
Receivable, Bad Debts and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    

An
allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as a percentage of trade accounts receivable based on historical loss experience.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $20,000 and $20,000, respectively.
Consolidated bad debt expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $4,021 and ($81,761), respectively.
The negative bad debt expense balance at September 30, 2015 was due to the allowance being overstated at September 30, 2015 and
requiring adjustment. Consolidated bad debt expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $408 and $762,
respectively.  

Property,
Plant and Equipment    

Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are
capitalized. As property and equipment are sold or retired, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss thereon is recognized as other income or expenses.  

Depreciation
is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the term
of the related lease, including renewal periods, if shorter. Estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Transportation equipment     
         5 years      
 
     Office and machinery equipment    
         5-7 years      
 
     Roll off containers       
         5-7 years      
 
     Improvements    
         5-7 years      
 
     Buildings    
         39.5 years

Property,
Plant and Equipment (Continued)    

The
Company reviews property, plant, equipment and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability is based on estimated undiscounted
cash flows. Measurement of the impairment loss, if any, is based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Amortizable Intangible Assets    

The
Company follows ASC 360-10,  Property, Plant, and Equipment,  which established a  primary asset  approach
to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for
a long-lived asset to be held and used. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset
is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Through September 30, 2016, the Company has not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets or intangible assets.  

Goodwill    

Goodwill
consists of the excess of cost over identifiable net tangible and intangible assets of companies acquired. In accordance with
the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,  the carrying amount
of goodwill and intangible assets is to be reviewed at least annually for impairment, and losses in value, if any, will be charged
to operations in the period of impairment. Goodwill was determined to not be impaired as of September 30, 2016. The test for impairment
was done in accordance with guidance in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-8 for the year ended December 31, 2015. ASU 2011-8
permits an entity to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether impairment is more likely than not to have occurred.  

The
Company acquired two related entities during 2015, WRE and Gateway, assigning $1,238,173 and $941,010 of Goodwill to the purchase
prices of those entities, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired a company for $230,000
and assigned $36,053 to goodwill based on the acquisition purchase price allocation. Total Goodwill at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 was $2,215,236 and $2,179,183, respectively. See Note 10,  Acquisitions  for the purchase price
allocation of the business.  

Intangible
Assets    

The
Company has certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations and acquisitions that are recorded at cost. Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.

Note

Intangible
Assets (Continued)    

Intangible
assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying
value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually
determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset. See note 10,  Acquisitions  for details related
to the purchase price allocation of identified definite lived amortizable intangible assets, including customer lists, licenses,
permits, non-compete agreements and trademarks. The Company has a customer list that was bought from a related party in 2011,
a website built in 2015 and engineering costs as part of a 10-year permit renewal with the Department of Environmental Protection.
The Company purchased two related entities during 2015 and one unrelated business in 2016, assigning a portion of the purchase
price to amortizable intangible assets, primarily customer lists to the purchases accordingly. See note 4,  Intangible Assets 
and Note 10,  Acquisitions.   

Advertising
Costs    

The
Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Consolidated advertising expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were $6,405 and $2,674, respectively. The consolidated advertising expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,605 and $2,302, respectively.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company reviews the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to
determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent interest
and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts are accrued and classified
as a component of income tax expense. For the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not recognize any
accrued interest or penalties.  

The
Company files income tax returns in the United States and Florida, which are subject to examination by the tax authorities in
these jurisdictions, generally for three years after the filing date.  

Management
has evaluated tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, and has not identified any tax positions that require
disclosure.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the following tax years are subject to examination:

Environmental
Remediation Liability     

The
Company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably
estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion
of the remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of
future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental
remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.  

Operating,
General and Administrative Expenses    

Business
operating costs including expenses generated from administration and purchasing functions, are recorded in  Operating, general
and administrative expenses  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Business operating costs include items such as
wages, benefits, utilities, repairs and maintenance, advertising costs and credits, rent, insurance, depreciation not related
to equipment used in operations, amortization of intangible assets, leasehold amortization and costs for outside provided services.  

Stock
Issued to Non-Employees for Services Rendered    

The
Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505-50  Equity Based Payments
to Non-Employees.  FASB ASC 505-50 states that equity instruments that are issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or
services should be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued,
whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date occurs as of the earlier of (a) the date at which a performance commitment
is reached or (b) absent a performance commitment, the date at which the performance necessary to earn the equity instruments
is complete (that is, the vesting date).  

Earnings
Per-Share    

Earnings
per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding at each reporting period.  

Reclassifications    

Certain
reclassifications have been made in prior year balances to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had
no effect on net income or retained earnings as previously reported.

Note
5   Commitments and Contingencies    

General   

During
the normal course of business, the Company may be exposed to litigation. When the Company becomes aware of potential litigation,
it evaluates the merits of the case in accordance with FASB ASC 450, Contingencies. The Company evaluates its exposure to the
matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. If the Company determines that an
unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it establishes the necessary accruals. Certain insurance policies

                                         financial and operating performance may be affected by the inability to renew landfill
                                         operating permits, obtain new landfills and expand existing ones;    

Extensive
                                         and evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may restrict our operations
                                         and growth and increase our costs;    

Extensive
                                         regulations that govern the design, operation and closure of landfills may restrict our
                                         landfill operations or increase our costs of operating landfills; and    

Alternatives
                                         to landfill disposal may cause our revenues and operating results to decline.    

These
risks, as well as others, are discussed in greater detail in our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. There may be additional risks
of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business.
We make no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may change.  

GENERAL   

Overview   

We
are a vertically integrated waste management company offering landfill, transfer station, garbage collection and container services
for both commercial entities and residential customers in Central Florida and Upstate New York. We service the counties of Citrus,
Hernando, and Marion in Florida and Upstate New York. We average annual disposals of approximately 200,000 cubic yards of construction
debris and manage our 54-acre landfill facility. We started operations with one roll-off truck and now operate 13 roll-off trucks
and approximately 800 containers (after the WRE and Gateway Acquisitions). Since the year 2000, we have maintained a contract
with Citrus County Solid Waste Management landfill to back-up its roll-off trucks. On October 15, 2015 and December 1, 2015, we
acquired WRE and Gateway, respectively, as described above (Item 1, Business) and in Note 10 to the financial statements,  Acquisitions. 
These acquisitions added a large roll-off business for construction and demotion ( C D ) to operations as well
as full-service waste company in Upstate NY, offering residential and commercial trash collection, a transfer station and C D
services.  

Trends
and Uncertainties   

Whether
                                         there will be a decline in the construction and building industries;                                                                                                                                  

Whether
                                         scrap and recycling prices will decline;                                                                                                      

Whether
                                         the price of fuel will increase to the level that it will have a material negative impact
                                         on our results of operations; and                                                                                               

Whether
                                         our clients and/or future prospective clients internally develop a means by which to
                                         dispose of their waste, which would negatively impact our results of operations.     

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $4,889,453 and $1,349,824, respectively, an increase of $3,539,629
or approximately 262% of consolidated revenue. The $3,539,629 increase is due to the acquisitions of WRE and Gateway during the
fourth quarter of 2015 and the execution of our business model, increasing our customer base and expanded sales to current customers.  

Cost
of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,509,432 and $661,622, respectively, an increase of $1,847,810
or approximately 279%. This $1,847,810 increase is due to the acquisitions of WRE and Gateway during the fourth quarter of 2015.  

General
and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,288,794 and $380,775, respectively, reflecting
an increase of $1,908,019 or approximately 501%. This $1,908,019 increase is due to the WRE and Gateway acquisitions during the
fourth quarter of 2015.  

Interest
expense was $50,239 and $23,705 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase is attributable
to our acquisition of WRE, and the associated equipment financing and related equipment acquired as well as an equipment financing
during December 2015, which increased our long term-debt.  

Other
income and (expenses), net, were $(153,557) and $(28,512) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
an increase in the net expense of $125,045 or 439%. This $125,045 increase is due to the increase in interest expense discussed
above, and one time write off of deposits of $90,973.  

Net
income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(258,049) and $184,870, respectively. The decrease of
$442,919 was highly attributable to the non-cash depreciation and amortization charges to earnings of $793,394 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to depreciation and amortization charges of $122,064 to earnings during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The large increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisitions and purchase price allocations
of Gateway and WRE during 2015, which increased quarterly depreciation and amortization significantly. When adding back this large
charge, both periods show positive cash flows. We also incurred one time charges for losses on deposits, including $50,000 of
non-cash deposits paid for on our behalf by a related entity and later settled for 2 shares per one dollar of expenses incurred
with that entity.  

Comparison
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,771,819 and $479,698, respectively, an increase of $1,292,121 or
approximately 269% of consolidated revenue. This $1,292,121 increase is due to the WRE and Gateway acquisitions during the fourth
quarter of 2015 and the execution of our business model, increasing our customer base and expanded sales to current customers.  

Cost
of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $612,057 and $216,083 respectively, an increase of $395,974
or approximately 183%. This $395,974 increase is due to the acquisitions of WRE and Gateway during the fourth quarter of 2015.  

General
and administrative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,121,928 and $147,475, respectively, an
increase of $974,453 or approximately 661%. This $974,453 increase is due to the acquisitions of WRE and Gateway during the fourth
quarter of 2015.  

Interest
expense was $14,467 and $4,085 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase is attributable
to our acquisition of WRE and the associated equipment financing and related equipment.  

Other
income and (expenses), net, was $(26,812) and $(4,085) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
increase in the net expense of $22,727. The increase is due to the increase in interest expense discussed above, and a one-time
charge for a write off on a deposit of $18,500.  

Net
income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(210,649) and $81,754 respectively. The $292,403 decrease
is primarily attributable to the increased charges to depreciation and amortization expense after the acquisitions of WRE and
Gateway. See note above discussing change in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations. We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities,
together with borrowings, to fund purchases of equipment, working capital, acquisitions and debt repayments. As of September 30,
2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $451,752 and working capital of $281,267 as compared to cash of $344,365 and negative
working capital of $556,150 at December 31, 2015. The primary reason for the negative working capital at December 31, 2015 as
compared to positive working capital at September 30, 2016 was due to the conversion of a large portion of related party payables
to restricted common stock, mostly at $1 per share, though approximately $112,000 of expenses paid for on behalf of the Company
by a related entity were converted at $0.50 per share.  

Cash
Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Cash
flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 provided cash of $860,665 compared to $490,109 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $370,556 or 76%. This $370,556 increase was primarily due to increased
sales due to the WRE and Gateway acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2015, execution of our business plan and increased
customers, expenses incurred where stock was issued to settle professional fee liabilities rather than cash, and the timing of
payments on payables, accrued expenses and taxes. Our cash flows used in investing activities were $459,162 and $59,866 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $399,296 or 667%, primarily due to the acquisition
of a business for $230,000 during the second quarter of 2016 (three months ended June 30, 2016). Our cash flows used in financing
activities were $294,116 and $67,371 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $226,745
or 337%. The $226,745 increase is due to servicing the equipment financing debt in our fourth quarter acquisition of WRE and the
servicing of debt for a new grinder purchased in December of 2015, as well as the payment of $75,000 on the short-term acquisition
note with Gateway as part of the acquisition of that company.
