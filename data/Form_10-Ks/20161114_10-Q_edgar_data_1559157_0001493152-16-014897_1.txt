1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

NATURE
OF OPERATIONS   

Sunstock,
Inc. (formerly known as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation) ( Sunstock  or  the Company ) was incorporated
on July 23, 2012 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited
to, selected mergers and acquisitions. Sunstock operations to date have been limited to issuing shares of its common stock. Sunstock
may attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with Sunstock. The combination
will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company
will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that Sunstock will be successful in locating
or negotiating with any target company.  

In
December 2014, the Company purchased 100 ounces of silver. In 2015, the Company purchased additional precious metals for $302,429
and shifting more of its capital to the acquisition of precious metals. The Company holds physical coins and bullion rather than
contracts for delivery of precious metals or certificates. In time of economic crisis, there may be no guarantee of the delivery
of precious metals as contracts and certificates may exceed available stock.  

Currently,
the Company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment. Depending on market conditions, the Company anticipates
holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds $50. Likewise, the Company does not plan to sell its gold holdings
unless the market price exceeds $2,500.  

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION   

The
condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements and the interim unaudited
condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally
Accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Form 10-Q and Article 8 of SEC Regulation S-X. These condensed financial statements
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these
unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and
notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Form 10-K.  

The
condensed financial statements included herein as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited;
however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of the Company s management, are
necessary to present fairly the condensed financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the condensed results of
its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended Septmeber 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed cash flows for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates made by the Company s management include but are not limited to valuation of marketable securities,
realizability of inventories and value of stock-based transactions.  

INVENTORIES   

Inventories
consist of merchandise for sale and are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
When a purchase contains multiple copies of the same item, they are stated at average cost.  

Inventories
  silver consists primarily of silver and small amounts of gold held for sale and are stated at cost. Currently, the Company
anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment. Depending on market conditions, the Company anticipates holding
its silver holdings until the market price exceeds $50. Likewise, the Company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the
market price exceeds $2,500.  

At
each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for
excess quantities and obsolescence. Among other factors, the Company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation
to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence
and net realizable value. In addition, the Company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net
realizable value of its inventory. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable
values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

The
Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Certification (ASC ) Topic 605. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, product delivery and acceptance have occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the transaction
is assured.  

EARNINGS
(LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share represent income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding during the period which excluded unvested restricted stock. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment
to income (loss) that would result from the assumed issuance. The potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate
to outstanding stock options and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would
reduce the reported loss per share and therefore have an anti-dilutive effect.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there were no potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share
as their effect would have been antidilutive for each of the periods presented.  

STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION   

ASC
718  Compensation - Stock Compensation  prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payment
awards to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation
rights, may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-based
payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the
option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of
an entity s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction is recognized as a liability;
otherwise, the transaction is recognized as equity.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC
505-50  Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.  Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees
is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments
issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
completion date.  

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN   

The
Company has not posted operating income since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,279,466 as of September
30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third
parties.  

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations
and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial
support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, successfully
locating and negotiating with an acquisition target.  

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

See
Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
as of and the period ended June 30, 2016 for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption
and estimated effects on our unaudited condensed financial statements.  

NOTE
4 - RELATED PARTY BALANCES   

The
Company has not incurred any salaries and related expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The parents
of the Company s officer have contributed their time without compensation, nor any amounts due. They assist with operating
the Company s store. In addition, the Company receives consulting services from a shareholder without any compensation,
nor any amounts due. The Company approximates the quarterly expense would total $15,000 to hire and pay for comparable services.
No such amounts have been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

In
January 2015, the Company s CEO has provided the Company with a revolving line of credit of up to $120,000. All principal
and interest (5%) was due and payable in January 2016. There were no borrowings under the revolving line and it was closed in
February 2016.  

The
Company has $30,000 of non-interest bearing, non-secured line of credit with a shareholder. The line is due on demand. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had net borrowings of approximately $30,000 and $20,000 respectively, which are included
in accounts payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. The line expires in December 2016.  

NOTE
5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGIENCIES   

On
April 8, 2014, the Company entered into a sixty-seven month lease agreement for its second retail store. The lease requires monthly
payments of base rent of $4,756, with free rent for months one through four, month seven, month nine and month eleven. The base
rent increases gradually over the term of the lease. This store began operations on May 8, 2014.  

LITIGATION   

In
December 2013, the Company issued 75,000 shares of common stock to a third party (the  Shareholder ) for consideration
of $16,000. Such consideration was received directly by Jason Chang, CEO, and was not deposited into the Company s bank
account. As the funds had not been received by the Company, such amounts have been recorded as compensation to Mr. Chang as of
December 31, 2014. In April 2014, the Company received notice from the Shareholder that he had filed a lawsuit against the Company
and its CEO relating to the delay in the complainants  stock reaching public listing services. In June, 2016 the Company
received a judgement of $82,660, which is due on demand and has reflected this amount in accrued litigation on the accompanying
balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and $55,200 at December 31, 2015.  

INDEMNITIES
AND GUARANTEES   

The
Company has made certain indemnities and guarantees, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified
party, in relation to certain actions or transactions. The Company indemnifies its directors, officers, employees and agents,
as permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with its facility leases, the Company has agreed to indemnify
its lessors for certain claims arising from the use of the facilities. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies,
and is generally tied to the life of the agreement. These guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the
maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated nor
incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities and guarantees
in the accompanying balance sheet.  

NOTE
6 - STOCKHOLDER S EQUITY   

The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having
a par value of $0.001 per share.  

During
the first quarter of 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares of fully vested non-forfeitable shares of common
stock to certain consultants of the Company to be earned over a one-year period. The shares were valued at $216,000 (based on
the closing market price on the measurement date) and have been recorded as prepaid consulting in the accompanying condensed balance
sheet. The Company has amortized approximately $54,000 and $135,000 of such expense during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively  

In
February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a media consultant to create brand awareness in return for 150,000 shares
of fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock valued at $187,500 (based on the market closing price on the measurement date) to
be earned over a six-month period and $1,500 per each filming session. The shares are recorded as prepaid consulting expense in
the accompanying condensed balance sheet. The Company amortized approximately $49,000 and $188,000 of consulting expense during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,860,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain
employees for future services. The unearned restricted shares have been excluded from the loss per share calculation. The Company
also received proceeds of $2,010 related to such issuances. The total fair value of the shares of restricted common stock issued
of $5,005,800 was based on the market price of the restricted stock on date of grant to be amortized to stock-based compensation
expense over the term of the requisite service period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
expensed $930,038 and $1,266,638 respectively related to the vested portion of the shares issued.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received an aggregate of $24,767 from the issuance of 464,335 shares of
common stock.  

The
following table summarizes the restricted stock activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Awards
of restricted stock vest ratably over the term of the respective employment agreements.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements was
$3,739,163 and the weighted average period of years expected to recognize those costs was 0.74 years.  

NOTE
7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing date of this Form 10-Q and determined that no subsequent events have
occurred that would require recognition in the condensed financial statements or disclosures in the notes thereto other than as
disclosed in the accompanying notes to the condensed financial statements.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Overview   

Sunstock,
Inc., formerly Sandgate Acquisition Corporation ( Sunstock ) was incorporated on July 23, 2012 under the laws of the
State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.  

Management
intends to develop the Company for the acquisition and operation of hotels, discount retail stores, and residential properties
in the high demand areas of California, particularly Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area. In December 2014, the
Company commenced their investment in precious metals. At September 30, 2016 the Company has $428,663 in the investment account.
In September 2013, new management developed plans to open and operate two retail stores in Sacramento, California. On October
30, 2013, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Dollar Store Services, Inc. to develop, design and build out a retail
store which the Company began operating in February 2014. Additionally, the Company entered into a lease agreement on October
30, 2013 for 2,239 square feet of retail shop space for this store in Sacramento, California. The lease requires monthly payments
for rent and maintenance of $3,733 for thirty six months beginning February 2014.  

Management
opened an additional retail store in Sacramento, California in May of 2014 and entered into a retail shop lease for sixty-seven
months beginning May 2014 for approximately 4,756 square feet. The monthly base rent for this location is currently $4,756, with
seven months of free rent throughout the first eleven months. The base rent will gradually increase until the term expires in
2019. This store began operations on May 8, 2014 until December 2015 at which time the Company entered into a lease agreement
for 2,700 square feet of retail shop space to replace their previous location above. The lease requires combined monthly payments
of base rent of $1,950 for six months beginning January 2016 with a one year option.  

Silver
and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion
bars. In some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks.
Another means of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99% pure Canadian Silver
Maple Leaf and the one ounce 99.93% pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and
precious metals is through exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds
that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London
and New York Stock Exchanges.  

The
Company believes that monetary policies adopted by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan may cause an increase
in inflation. Gold and silver have traditionally served as a hedge against economic uncertainty and high inflation.  

Going
Concern    

As
of September 30, 2016, The Company has not posted operating income since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of ($2,279,466)
since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third
parties.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

There
have been no material changes from the critical accounting policies as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Results
of Operations   

Discussion
of the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
Company generated revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $9,966 as compared to $11,696 in revenues posted
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to the closing of one of the stores in
August 2014 and sales at the new store not at pace with the third quarter of 2015.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 cost of sales was $5,335 and $6,668, respectively, which was driven by the
decrease in revenues as disclosed above. Operating expenses increased to $1,063,768 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from $39,666 for the same period of 2015 primarily as a result of share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company posted an operating loss of $1,059,137 as compared to an operating loss
of $34,238 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, such increase is primarily related to an increase in expenses related
to increase operating expenses, share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.  

The
unrealized loss on investments in precious metals of $1,577 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, is related to the
decrease in the market value of the underlying assets held as of September 30, 2016.  

Discussion
of the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

The
Company generated revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $33,476 as compared to $48,699 in revenues posted
for the nine ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to the closing of one of the stores in August
2014 and sales at the new store not at pace with the first nine months of 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the cost of sales was $17,921 and $25,036 respectively, as sales for the periods
declined as well.  

Operating
expenses increased to $1,706,652 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $151,376 for the same period of 2015 as a result
of share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company posted an operating loss of $1,691,097 as compared to an operating loss
of $127,713 for the nine months ending September 30, 2015, such increase is primarily related to an increase in expenses related
to operating expenses, stock-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.  

The
unrealized gain on investments in precious metals of $114,055 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is related to the
increase in the market value of the underlying assets held as of September 30, 2016.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used cash in operating activities of $25,751, which was attributable to
net loss of $1,571,996, common stock issued for services of $1,589,138 offset by unrealized gain of $114,055 in the period. During
such period, the Company also used cash from investing activities in the amount of $12,479 for the purchase of silver inventory.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had cash provided by financing activities which was attributable to cash
proceeds of $26,777 from the sale of common stock.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had $2,246 in cash and $23,800 in inventory   products, and $428,663 in inventory - silver.

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements   

The
Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that would be considered material to investors.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Information
not required to be filed by Smaller reporting companies.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Pursuant
to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of
the end of the fiscal year under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer
(who is also the principal financial officer). There have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, he believes
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in gathering, analyzing and disclosing information
needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, summarized
and processed timely. The principal executive officer is directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company.  

Management s
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

The
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company s officer, its president, conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the criteria
establish in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of September 30, 2016, based on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
have been detected.  

Material
Weaknesses    :   

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

The
material weaknesses identified are:  

1.
Inadequate number of personnel that could accurately and timely record and report the Company s financial statements in
accordance with GAAP;  

We
did not employ an adequate number of people to ensure a control environment that would allow for the accurate and timely reporting
of the financial statements.  

2.
Ineffective controls to ensure that the accounting for transactions are recorded in accordance with GAAP financial statements;  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, adjustments were made to the general ledger, which collectively could have a material
effect on the financial statements.  

Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, we believe that the financial statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Further, we do not believe the material weaknesses identified had an impact on
prior financial statements.  

Remediation:   

As
part of our ongoing remedial efforts, we have and will continue to, among other things:  

1.
Expanded our accounting policy and controls organization by recently hiring qualified accounting and finance personnel;  

2.
Increase our efforts to educate both our existing and expanded accounting policy and control organization on the application of
the internal control structure;  

3.
Emphasize with management the importance of our internal control structure;  

4.
Seek outside consulting services where our existing accounting policy and control organization believes the complexity of the
existing exceeds our internal capabilities; and  

5.
Plan to implement improved accounting systems.  

We
believe that the foregoing actions will improve our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls
and procedures. We intend to perform such procedures and commit such resources as necessary to continue to allow us to overcome
or mitigate these material weaknesses such that we can make timely and accurate quarterly and annual financial filings until such
time as those material weaknesses are fully addressed and remediated.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during its current fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
