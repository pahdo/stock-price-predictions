1.    Basis of Presentation  

The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Bank Mutual Corporation (the  Company ), its wholly-owned subsidiary Bank Mutual
(the  Bank ), and the Bank s subsidiaries. 

The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
for interim financial information, Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X, and the instructions to Form 10-Q. The financial statements do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial information. However, in the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring entries) necessary for a fair presentation of operations, cash flows,
and financial position have been included in the accompanying financial statements. This report should be read in conjunction with
the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 

In 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance related to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
In 2015 the FASB deferred the effective date one year from the date in the original guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, which will be the first quarter of 2019 for the Company. In 2016 the
FASB issued two new pronouncements to amend and clarify the original guidance with no change to the effective date. The Company s
adoption of this item is not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. 

In 2015 the FASB issued new accounting
guidance relating to the consolidation of legal entities for financial reporting purposes. For public companies, the guidance is
effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, which was the first quarter of 2016 for the Company. The Company s
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. 

In 2016 the FASB issued new accounting
guidance related to certain aspects of the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. For public companies
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be the first quarter of 2018 for the Company.
Early application of some aspects of the new guidance is also permitted, although the Company does not intend to adopt the guidance
early. The Company s eventual adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations
or financial condition. 

In 2016 the FASB issued new accounting
guidance related to the accounting for lease assets and liabilities. For public companies the guidance is effective for periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, which will be the first quarter of 2019 for the Company. The Company s adoption of this
item is not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. 

In 2016 the FASB issued new accounting
guidance related to the accounting for employee share-based compensation. For public companies the guidance is effective for periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016.
The Company s adoption of this item did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. 

In 2016 the FASB issued new accounting
guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the current methodology
of measuring credit losses based on incurred losses at the balance sheet date with a methodology that measures credit losses based
on the current estimate of expected credit losses. For the Company this guidance is effective for periods beginning after December
15, 2019, which will be the first quarter of 2020. Management has not yet completed the complex analysis required to determine
the impact adoption of this new guidance could have on the Company s results of operations or financial condition.

In 2016 the FASB issued new accounting
guidance related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. For the Company
this guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be the first quarter of 2018. The Company s
adoption of this item is not expected to have a material impact on the statement of cash flows. 

2.    Mortgage-Related Securities Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity  

The amortized cost and fair value of mortgage-related
securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity are as follows:

2.    Mortgage-Related Securities Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity
(continued)  

The following tables summarize mortgage-related
securities by amount of time the securities have had a gross unrealized loss as of the dates indicated: 

The Company determined that the unrealized
losses on its mortgage-related securities were temporary as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. The Company does not
intend to sell these securities and it is unlikely that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their
amortized cost. The Company believes it is probable that it will receive all future contractual cash flows related to these securities.
This determination was based on management s judgment regarding the nature of the loan collateral that supports the securities,
a review of the current ratings issued on the securities by various credit rating agencies, recent trends in the fair market values
of the securities and, in the case of private-label collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), a review of the actual
delinquency and/or default performance of the loan collateral that supports the securities. 

As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, the Company had private-label CMOs, with a fair value of $12,759 and $15,725, respectively, and unrealized gains of $109
and $237, respectively, that were rated less than investment grade. These private-label CMOs were analyzed using modeling techniques
that considered the priority of cash flows in the CMO structure and various default and loss rate scenarios that management considered
appropriate given the nature of the loan collateral.

The following table contains a summary
of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) related to credit losses that have been recognized in earnings as of the
dates indicated for private label CMOs, as well as the end of period values for securities that have experienced such losses: 

Results of operations included no gross
realized gains or losses on the sale of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

Mortgage-related securities available-for-sale
with a fair value of approximately $87,174 and $67,923 at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, were pledged
to secure deposits, borrowings, and for other purposes as permitted or required by law.

3.    Loans Receivable  

The following table summarizes the components of loans receivable
as of the dates indicated: 

The Company s commercial and retail
borrowers are primarily located in the Company s local lending areas in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Iowa,
as is the real estate and non-real estate collateral that secures the Company s loans. 

At September 30, 2016, and December 31,
2015, certain one- to four-family mortgage loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and home equity loans with aggregate carrying values
of approximately $554,000 and $496,000 were pledged to secure advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) of
Chicago. 

The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced
for others was $1,003,130 and $1,038,588 at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. These loans are not reflected
in the consolidated financial statements.

3.    Loans Receivable (continued)  

The following tables summarize the activity
in the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment for the periods indicated. The tables also summarize the allowance for
loan loss and loans receivable by the nature of the impairment evaluation, either individually or collectively, at the dates indicated
(the loans receivable amounts in the table are net of undisbursed loan proceeds). 

The Company adjusts certain factors used
to determine the allowance for loan losses on loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Management considered these
adjustments necessary and prudent in light of trends in net charge-offs, real estate values, economic conditions, and unemployment.
The Company estimates that these changes, as well as overall changes in the balance of loans to which these factors were applied,
resulted in an increase (decrease) in the total allowance for loan losses of $1,213 and $1,873 during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, and of $(1,139) and $(3,367) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

3.    Loans Receivable (continued)  

Loans rated  pass  or  watch 
are generally current on contractual loan and principal payments and comply with other contractual loan terms. Pass loans generally
have no noticeable credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses. Loans rated watch, however, will typically exhibit early signs
of credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. Loans rated  special mention 
do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant a lower rating, but possess clear trends in credit
deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. The allowance for loan losses on loans rated
pass, watch, or special mention is typically evaluated collectively for impairment using a homogenous pool approach. This approach
utilizes quantitative factors developed by management from its assessment of historical loss experience, qualitative factors, and
other considerations. 

Loans rated  substandard  involve
a distinct possibility that the Company could sustain some loss if deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected. Loans
rated  doubtful  indicate that full collection is highly questionable or improbable. The Company did not have any loans
that were rated doubtful at September 30, 2016, or December 31, 2015. Loans rated substandard or doubtful that are also considered
in management s judgment to be impaired are generally analyzed individually to determine an appropriate allowance for loan
loss. A loan rated  loss  is considered uncollectible, even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future.
The Company generally charges off loans that are rated as a loss. As such, the Company did not have any loans that were rated loss
at September 30, 2016, or December 31, 2015.

3.    Loans Receivable (continued)  

As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, $366 and $484 in student loans, respectively, were 90-days past due, but remained on accrual status because such loans
were originated under programs guaranteed by the federal government. No other loans 90-days past due were in accrual status as
of either date. 

The Company classifies a loan modification
as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) when it has granted a borrower experiencing financial difficulties a concession
that it would otherwise not consider. Loan modifications that result in insignificant delays in the receipt of payments (generally
six months or less) are not considered TDRs under the Company s TDR policy. TDRs are relatively insignificant and/or infrequent
in the Company and generally consist of loans placed in interest-only status for a short period of time or payment forbearance
for greater than six months. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, TDRs were $4,164 and $8,704, respectively, and consisted
primarily of commercial and industrial and one- to four-family mortgage loans. TDRs in accrual status as of those same dates were
$2,916 and $2,558, respectively. Additions to TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were immaterial. In
addition, TDRs that experienced a payment default within one year of their restructuring during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, and twelve months ended September 30, 2015, were also immaterial. TDRs are evaluated for impairment and appropriate credit
losses are recorded in accordance with the Company s accounting policies and GAAP.

7.    Borrowings (continued)  

As discussed in Note 12,  Financial
Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Derivative Financial Instruments,  the Company has entered into cash flow hedges
using interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk exposure associated with certain forecasted borrowings from the FHLB
of Chicago. Two advances maturing in October 2016 of $10,000 each have corresponding pay-fixed interest rate swaps that mature
in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although these advances have stated interest rates of 0.45%, they have effective interest rates
including the impact of the interest rate swaps of 1.02% and 1.28%, respectively. However, these advances have been included in
the table, above, at their contractual rates and maturities. If they had been included in the table at their hedge-adjusted rates
and maturities, the advances reported as maturing in 2018 and 2019 would have each been $10,000 higher and the weighted average
rates for those maturity years would have been 1.94% and 2.42% as of September 30, 2016, respectively. Furthermore, the weighted
average rate reported for total borrowings would have been 1.19% as of the same date. 

The Company is required to pledge
certain unencumbered mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities as collateral against its outstanding advances from the
FHLB of Chicago. Advances are also collateralized by the shares of capital stock of the FHLB of Chicago that are owned by the
Company. The Company s borrowings at the FHLB of Chicago are limited to the lesser of: (i) 35% of total assets; (ii)
22.2 times the FHLB of Chicago capital stock owned by the Company; or (iii) the total of 71% of the book value of one- to
four-family mortgage loans, 72% of the book value of certain multi-family mortgage loans, 51% of the book value of certain
home equity loans, and 98% of the fair value of certain mortgage-related securities.

8.    Regulatory Capital Requirements  

The Company and Bank are subject to various
regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies and as defined in applicable regulations. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators
that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines
and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve
quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
The Company and Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about
components, risk weightings, and other factors. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the
Company and the Bank met or exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The following table presents
the Company and the Bank s actual and required regulatory capital amounts and ratios as of the dates indicated.

The following table summarizes the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated: 

The Company had stock options for 359,834
and 345,200 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. These options had weighted average exercise prices of $8.18 and $8.11 per share
as of those dates, respectively. 

10.    Employee Benefit Plans  

The Company has a discretionary, defined
contribution savings plan (the  Savings Plan ). The Savings Plan is qualified under Sections 401 and 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code and provides employees meeting certain minimum age and service requirements the ability to make contributions
to the Savings Plan on a pretax basis. The Company then matches a percentage of the employee s contributions. Matching contributions
expensed by the Company were $205 and $190 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $630 and
$598 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The Company also has a qualified defined
benefit pension plan covering employees meeting certain minimum age and service requirements and a supplemental defined benefit
pension plan for certain eligible employees. The supplemental pension plan is funded through a  rabbi trust  arrangement.
The benefits under these plans are generally based on the employee s years of service and average annual wages, as defined
in the plan. The Company s funding policy is to contribute annually the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In prior periods the Company closed the qualified defined benefit pension plan
to new participants and froze the benefits of all existing participants. These changes resulted in the future benefits under the
Company s supplemental defined benefit pension plan also being effectively frozen.

The following table summarizes the supplemental
plan s net periodic costs for the periods indicated. 

A contribution of $650,000 to the qualified
plan was made in the third quarter of 2016. This contribution was determined based on a number of factors, including the results
of an actuarial valuation report as of January 1, 2016. No contribution is necessary in 2016 for the supplemental plan. 

11.    Stock-Based Benefit Plans  

In 2004 the Company s shareholders
approved the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan ). Options and restricted stock granted under the 2004 Plan
vested over five years and options had expiration terms of ten years. No further awards may be made under the 2004 Plan. 

In 2014 the Company s shareholders
approved the 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2014 Plan ), which provides for the award of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and cash awards. Stock-related awards under
the 2014 Plan vest over a period of three or more years and, if applicable, have a maximum term of ten years. The number of shares
of common stock of the Company that may be issued under the 2014 Plan is limited to 3,000,000 shares. As of September 30, 2016,
2,497,600 shares remain eligible for award under the 2014 Plan. 

Restricted stock grants are amortized to
compensation expense as the Company s employees and directors become vested in the granted shares. The amount amortized to
expense was $265 and $148 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount amortized to expense
was $744 and $553 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Outstanding non-vested restricted stock
grants had a fair value of $1,963 and an unamortized cost of $1,721 at September 30, 2016. The cost of these shares is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.96 years. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded stock option compensation expense of $89 and $102, respectively. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded stock option compensation expense of $270 and $309, respectively. As of
September 30, 2016, there was $522 in total unrecognized stock option compensation expense related to non-vested options. This
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.97 years.

The following table provides additional
information regarding the Company s outstanding options as of September 30, 2016. 

There were 138,834 options exercised during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which had an intrinsic value of $367. There were 157,600 options exercised during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, which had an intrinsic value of $400. The weighted average grant date fair value of non-vested
options at September 30, 2016, was $1.76 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, options for 56,300 shares
were granted, options for 260,038 shares became vested, and 13,132 non-vested options shares were forfeited.

11.    Stock-Based Benefit Plans (continued)  

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of granted options. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, the Company's stock options
have characteristics significantly different from traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate. Option valuation models such as Black-Scholes require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility, which is computed using ten years of actual price
activity in the Company s stock. The Company uses historical data of employee behavior as a basis to estimate the
expected life of the options, as well as forfeitures due to employee terminations. The Company also uses its actual dividend
yield at the time of the grant, as well as actual U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of the grant to estimate the
risk-free rate. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value 56,300 options granted during the nine  month
period ended September 30, 2016: risk free rate of 1.80%, dividend yield of 2.74%, expected stock volatility of 31%, and
expected term to exercise of 7.5 years. These options had a weighted-average value of $2.28 per option using these
assumptions. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value 44,000 options granted during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2015: risk free rate of 1.81%, dividend yield of 2.45%, expected stock volatility of 33.5%, and
expected term to exercise of 7.5 years. These options had a weighted-average value of $2.11 per option using these
assumptions. 

12.    Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and
Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company is party to financial instruments
with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments
consist of commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of
the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contract amounts reflect the extent of involvement
the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments and also represents the Company s maximum exposure to credit
loss. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements
to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and generally require payment of a fee. As some commitments expire without
being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates the
collateral needed and creditworthiness of each customer on a case by case basis. The Company generally extends credit only on a
secured basis. Collateral obtained varies, but consists principally of one- to four-family residences. 

Off-balance sheet financial instruments
or obligations whose contract amounts represent credit and/or interest rate are summarized in the following table as of the dates
indicated:

12.    Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and
Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)  

The Company sells substantially all of
its long-term, fixed-rate, one- to four-family loan originations in the secondary market. The Company uses interest rate lock
commitments ( IRLCs ) and forward commitments to sell loans to manage interest rate risk associated with its loan
sales activities, both of which are considered to be free-standing derivative financial instruments under GAAP. Changes in the
fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently through earnings. During the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, net unrealized gains (losses) of $86 and $(197), respectively, were recognized in net gain on loan sales activities
on these derivative instruments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net unrealized gains of $119 and $10,
respectively, were recognized in net gain on loan sales activities on these derivative instruments. These amounts were exclusive
of net unrealized gains of $36 and $68 on loans held-for-sale for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $172 and $5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were also included in net gain on loan
sales activities. 

The Company enters into interest rate swap
arrangements to manage the interest rate risk exposure associated with specific commercial loan relationships at the time such
loans are originated. These interest rate swaps, as well as the embedded derivatives associated with certain of its commercial
loan relationships, are free-standing derivative instruments under GAAP. As such, changes in the fair value of these derivative
instruments are recognized currently through earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net unrealized
gains of $206 and $304, respectively, and net losses of $206 and $304, respectively, related to interest rate swaps and embedded
derivatives were recorded in loan-related fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net unrealized gains
of $247 and $360, respectively, and net losses of $247 and $360, respectively, related to interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives
were recorded in loan-related fees. 

The Company also enters into interest rate
swap arrangements to manage the interest rate risk exposure associated with certain forecasted borrowings from the FHLB of Chicago.
These interest rate swaps have been designated as forecasted transaction cash flow hedges by management (refer to Note 7,  Borrowings ).
As such, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of these derivatives is recorded in other comprehensive income and
the ineffective portion was recorded in interest expense. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $84 and $(114)
in unrealized gain (loss) net of tax related to interest rate swaps was recorded in other comprehensive income, respectively. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $136 and $136 in unrealized loss net of tax related to interest rate swaps
was recorded in other comprehensive income, respectively. There was no ineffective portion of this hedge for any of these periods. 

The following table summarizes the Company s
derivative assets and liabilities as of the dates indicated: 

The unrealized gains shown in the above
table were included as a component of other assets as of the dates indicated. The unrealized losses were included in other liabilities

13.    Fair Value Measurements  

Fair value is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
(exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,
including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable,
market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring value measurements
and endeavors to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company is able to classify fair value measurements based
on the observability of those inputs. Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1), the next highest priority is given to prices based on models, methodologies, and/or management judgments
that rely on direct or indirect observable inputs (Level 2), and the lowest priority to prices derived from models, methodologies,
and/or management judgments that rely on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). There were no transfers of assets or liabilities
between categories of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The methods and assumptions used by the
Company in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments, whether or not such fair values are recognized in the consolidated
financial statements, are summarized below: 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  
The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets 
fair values. The Company considers the fair value of cash and cash equivalents to be Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage-Related Securities Available-for-Sale
and Held-to-Maturity   Fair values for these securities are based on price estimates obtained from a third-party independent
pricing service. This service utilizes pricing models that 

 vary by asset class and incorporate available
trade, bid, ask, and other market information of comparable instruments. For structured securities, such as CMOs, the pricing models
include cash flow estimates that consider the impact of loan performance data, including, but not limited to, expectations relating
to loan prepayments, default rates, and loss severities. Management has reviewed the pricing methodology used by its pricing service
to verify that prices are determined in accordance with the fair value guidance specified in GAAP. The Company considers the fair
value of mortgage-related securities to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans Receivable   Loans receivable
are segregated by type such as one- to four-family, multi-family, and commercial real estate mortgage loans, consumer loans, and
commercial business loans. The fair value of each type is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the expected maturity
of the loans using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan type. The
estimated maturity is based on the Company s historical experience with prepayments for each loan classification, modified,
as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions. The Company considers the fair value of loans
receivable to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights  
The Company estimates the fair market value of MSRs for those loans that are sold with servicing rights retained. For valuation
purposes, the related loans are stratified into pools by product type and, within product type, by interest rates. The fair value
of the MSR pools is based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using current market assumptions for prepayments,
servicing cost, and other factors. The Company considers the fair value of MSRs to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

13.    Fair Value Measurements (continued)  

The following table summarizes the significant
inputs utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its MSRs as of September 30, 2016: 

MSR pools with an amortized cost basis
greater than fair value are carried at fair value in the Company s financial statements. There were no pools determined to
be impaired at September 30, 2016, or December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Company had no valuation allowance as of September 30,
2016, or December 31, 2015. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock  
FHLB of Chicago stock is carried at cost, which is its redeemable (fair) value, since the market for this stock is restricted.
The Company considers the fair value of FHLB of Chicago stock to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable  
The carrying values of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate their fair value. The Company considers the fair value
of accrued interest receivable and payable to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Deposit Liabilities and Advance Payments
by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance   Fair value for demand deposits equal book value. The Company considers the fair value
of demand deposits to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values for certificates of deposits are estimated using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies 

 current market borrowing interest rates to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities on deposits. The 

 Company considers the fair value of certificates
of deposit to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance are equal to their
carrying amounts at the reporting date. The Company considers the fair value of advance payment by borrowers to be Level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. 

Borrowings   The fair value
of long-term borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow calculations with the discount rates equal to interest rates currently
being offered for borrowings with similar terms and maturities. The carrying value on short-term borrowings approximates fair value.
The Company considers the fair value of borrowings to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance
Sheet Risk and Derivative Financial Instruments   Off-balance sheet financial instruments consist of commitments to extend
credit, IRLCs, forward commitments to sell loans, interest rate swaps, and embedded derivatives related to certain commercial loan
relationships. Commitments to extend credit that are not IRLCs generally carry variable rates of interest. As such, the fair value
of these instruments is not material. The Company considers the fair value of these instruments to be Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy. The carrying value of IRLCs, forward commitments to sell loans, interest rate swaps, and embedded derivatives is equal
to their fair value. For IRLCs and forward commitments, the fair value is the difference between the current market prices for
securities collateralized by similar loans and the notional amounts of the IRLCs and forward commitments. The fair value of the
Company s interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives is determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected
cash flows of each derivative and also includes a nonperformance or credit risk component. The Company considers the fair value
of IRLCs, forward commitments to sell loans, interest rate swaps, and embedded derivatives to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

13.    Fair Value Measurements (continued)  

Impaired Loans   For non-accrual
loans greater than an established threshold and individually evaluated for impairment and all renegotiated loans, impairment is
measured based on: (i) the fair value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs (collectively
the  collateral value method ) or (ii) the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan s
original effective interest rate (the  discounted cash flow method ). The resulting valuation allowance, if any, is
a component of the allowance for loan losses. The discounted cash flow method is a fair value measure. For the collateral value
method, the Company generally obtains appraisals on a periodic basis to support the fair value of collateral underlying the loans.
Appraisals are performed by independent certified and/or licensed appraisers that have been reviewed by the Company and incorporate
information such as recent sales prices for comparable properties, costs of construction, and net operating income of the property
or business. Selling costs are generally estimated at 10%. Appraised values may be further discounted based on management judgment
regarding changes in market conditions and other factors since the time of the appraisal. A significant unobservable input in using
net operating income to estimate fair value is the capitalization rate. At September 30, 2016, the range of capitalization rates
utilized to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral on certain loans was 5.5% to 11.5%. The Company considers these
fair values to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. For those loans individually evaluated for impairment using the collateral
value method, a valuation allowance of $223 was recorded for loans with a recorded investment of $23,014 at September 30, 2016.
These amounts were $535 and $37,119 at December 31, 2015, respectively. Provision for (recovery of) loan losses related to these
loans was $222 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $535 during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015.
Provision for (recovery of) loan losses related to impaired loans at September 30, 2015, was $32 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

Foreclosed Properties   Foreclosed
properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs
to sell. In determining fair value, the Company generally obtains appraisals to support the fair value of foreclosed properties,
as described in the previous paragraph. In certain instances, the Company may also use the selling list price, less estimated costs
to sell, as the fair value of foreclosed properties. In such instances, the list price is generally less than the appraised value.
The Company considers these fair values to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2016, $2,453 in foreclosed
properties was valued at collateral value compared to $2,794 at December 31, 2015. Losses of $137 and $330 related to these foreclosed
properties were recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively.
Losses on foreclosed properties valued at collateral value at September 30, 2015 were $384 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015.

Results of Operations   

Overview   The Company reported
net income of $4.5 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016, which was a 33.2% increase over net income
of $3.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, the Company reported net income of $12.9
million or $0.28 per diluted share in 2016 compared to $10.5 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the same nine-month period in
2015. The improvements between these periods were primarily due to higher net interest income, higher loan-related fees, higher
mortgage banking revenue, and lower compensation-related expenses. Also contributing to the year-to-date improvement were lower
net losses and expenses on foreclosed real estate and lower occupancy, equipment, and data processing costs. These improvements
were partially offset by provisions for loan losses in the 2016 periods compared to recoveries in the 2015 periods, as well as
reduced gains on real estate held for investment and higher income tax expense. Also negatively impacting the year-to-date comparison
were lower brokerage and insurance commissions and higher advertising and marketing expenses in 2016 compared to 2015. The following
paragraphs describe these changes in greater detail, along with other matters affecting the Company s results of operations
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net Interest Income   The Company s
net interest income increased by $1.7 million or 10.1% and by $2.8 million or 5.4% during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. These increases were due in part to an increase in the Company s
average earning assets in the 2016 periods compared to the same periods in the prior year, as well as an increase in funding from
non-interest bearing checking accounts between the periods. Also contributing to the increase in the 2016 three- and nine-month
periods were call premiums of $577,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, which the Company received on mortgage-related securities
that were called during these periods. These favorable developments were partially offset by a decrease in the Company s
net interest margin in the 2016 periods compared to the same periods in 2015. 

The Company s average earning assets
increased by $180.5 million or 8.2% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. This
increase was primarily attributable to a $189.2 million or 11.6% increase in average loans receivable during the 2016 nine-month
period compared to the same period in the prior year. 

Also contributing favorably to the Company s
net interest income in the 2016 periods, as well as its net interest margin, was an increase in funding from non-interest-bearing
checking accounts. The average balance in these accounts increased by $34.1 million or 16.7% during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. 

The Company s net interest margin
was 3.08% and 3.03% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. However, excluding the impact of the
aforementioned call premiums, net interest margin for these periods would have been 2.98% and 2.97%, respectively. These amounts
compared to 3.05% and 3.12% during the same periods of 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
average yield on the Company s earning assets declined by 11 basis points (excluding call premiums) and its average cost
of funds increased by four basis points compared to the same period in 2015. The decline in the average yield on earning assets
was largely due to the continued repricing of the Company s loan portfolio to lower yields in the current interest rate environment,
as well as its continued emphasis on the origination of variable-rate loans, which generally have lower initial yields than fixed-rate
loans. However, management is hopeful that the negative impact these developments have had on the Company s loan portfolio
yield may have run their course and that the loan portfolio yield may stabilize or even improve slightly in the near term. However,
there can be no assurances; future results will depend in large part on developments affecting interest rates throughout the U.S.
economy. Also contributing to the decline in yield on earning assets in the 2016 periods has been the purchase of mortgage-related
securities in the current year at yields that were less than the prevailing rates in the investment portfolio. 

The increase in the Company s average
cost of funds was primarily due to a six basis point increase in its average cost of deposits during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year. The impact of this increase was offset slightly by a decline in the average
cost of borrowings from the FHLB of Chicago. This decline was caused by an increase in overnight borrowings, which were drawn to
fund growth in earning assets, as previously noted. Overnight borrowings generally have a lower interest cost than the rates the
Company offers on its certificates of deposit. 

The following tables present certain details
regarding the Company's average balance sheet and net interest income for the periods indicated. The tables present the average
yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The yields and costs are derived by dividing
income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods
shown. The average balances are derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees, which are
considered adjustments to yields. Net interest spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate
paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is derived by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning
assets. The Company s tax exempt investments are insignificant, so no tax equivalent adjustments have been made. 

(1)     For
the purposes of these computations, non-accruing loans and loans held-for-sale are included in loans receivable. 

 (2)     The
carrying value and earnings on stock in the FHLB of Chicago is included in investment securities. 

(3)     For
the purposes of these computations, non-accruing loans and loans held-for-sale are included in loans receivable. 

 (4)     The
carrying value and earnings on stock in the FHLB of Chicago is included in investment securities. 

The following tables present the extent
to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected
the Company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category
with respect to the change attributable to change in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate), the change attributable
to change in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior volume), and the net change. The change attributable to the combined impact
of volume and rate has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 

Provision for (recovery of) Loan
Losses   The Company s provision for (recovery of) loan losses was $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared
to $(930,000) in the same quarter last year. The provision (recovery) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $2.0 million
compared to $(2.6) million in the same period last year. Management believes that general economic, employment, and real estate
conditions continue to be relatively stable in the Company local markets. In addition, the Company s level of non-performing
loans, as well as its actual loan charge-offs, have continued to trend lower in recent periods, as noted later in this report.
However, economic growth in the United States has slowed in recent periods and the global economy, which has also slowed, has experienced
increased political-, trade-, and currency-related challenges. In addition, the Company has experienced a modest increase in classified
loans in recent months, as described later in this report. Management believes that these developments are early indications of
emerging difficulties in the credit and lending environment for the Company. These considerations, along with growth in the Company s
loan portfolio, contributed to management s conclusion that an increase in the allowance for loan losses was appropriate.
As such, the Company s allowance for loan losses increased from $17.6 million at December 31, 2015, to $19.2 million at September
30, 2016. Management anticipates that the Company s provision for loan losses may continue to consist of provisions rather
than recoveries for the foreseeable future. This is expected to be particularly true if the Company s loan portfolio continues
to grow as it has in recent periods. 

Trends in the credit quality of the Company s
loan portfolio are subject to many factors that are outside of the Company s control, such as economic and market conditions
that can fluctuate considerably from period to period. As such, there can be no assurances that there will not be significant fluctuations
in the Company s non-performing loans, classified loans, and/or loan charge-off activity from period to period, which may
result in significant variability in the Company s provision for loan losses. 

Non-Interest Income   Total
non-interest income increased by $871,000 or 14.5% and $2.6 million or 15.3% during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively. Significant reasons for the changes in the components of
non-interest income are discussed in the following paragraphs. 

Deposit-related fees and charges increased
slightly in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Year-to-date, however, deposit-related fees
were down modestly in 2016 compared to 2015. Deposit-related fees and charges consist of overdraft fees, ATM and debit card fees,
merchant processing fees, account service charges, and other revenue items related to services performed by the Company for its
retail and commercial deposit customers. Management attributes the fluctuations in deposit-related fees and charges to changes
in customer spending behavior in recent years which has generally resulted in lower revenue from overdraft charges and from check
printing commissions. Benefiting this revenue line item in recent periods, however, has been increased revenue from treasury management
and merchant card processing services that the Company offers to commercial depositors. 

Loan-related fees were $1.1 million and
$4.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These amounts compared to $476,000 and $1.4
million during the same periods in 2015, respectively. Loan-related fees consist of periodic income from lending activities that
are not deferred as yield adjustments under the applicable accounting rules. The largest source of fees in this revenue category
is interest rate swap fees related to commercial loan relationships. The Company mitigates the interest rate risk associated with
certain of its loan relationships by executing interest rate swaps, the accounting for which results in the recognition of a certain
amount of fee income at the time the swap contracts are executed. The increases in loan-related fees in the 2016 periods were the
result of increased loan production, as well as a lower interest rate environment that has increased borrower preference for the
types of loan transactions that generate interest rate swap fees. Management believes this source of revenue will vary considerably
from period to period depending on the rate environment and on borrower preference for the types of transactions that generate
interest rate swaps. Furthermore, a potential decline in the origination of multi-family and construction loans, which are the
types of loans that generate most of the Company s interest rate swap fees, could have a negative impact on such fee income
in the future, as more fully discussed elsewhere in this report. 

Brokerage and insurance commissions were
slightly lower during the third quarter of 2016 than they were in the same quarter of the previous year. Year-to-date this source
of revenue was $298,000 or 10.5% lower than the same period in 2015. This revenue item generally consists of commissions earned
on sales of tax-deferred annuities, mutual funds, and certain other securities, fees earned for investment advisory services, and
commissions earned on sales of personal and business insurance products. However, the prior year periods included certain non-recurring
incentive payments. Excluding those payments, brokerage and insurance commissions during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, were approximately 15% and 30% higher in the 2016 periods than they were in the same periods of 2015, respectively. Management
attributes these increases to new products, services, systems, and investment advisors that the Company has added in recent periods. 

Mortgage banking revenue, net, was $1.4
million and $3.3 million during three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This compared to $798,000 and $2.6
million during the same periods in 2015, respectively. The following table presents the components of mortgage banking revenue,
net, for the periods indicated: 

Loan servicing revenue, net, decreased
during the three- and nine-month periods in 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. These decreases were caused in part by a
decline in gross servicing fees due to an overall decline in loans serviced for third-party investors. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company serviced $1.003 billion in loans for third-party investors compared to $1.039 billion at December 31, 2015. Also contributing
to the decrease in loan servicing revenue, net, in the 2016 periods was an increase in amortization of MSR. These increases were
caused by lower market interest rates for one- to four-family loans in 2016, which resulted in increased loan prepayment activity
and faster amortization of the related MSRs. 

The change in valuation allowance that
the Company establishes against its MSRs is recorded as a recovery or loss, as the case may be, in the period in which the change
occurs. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no valuation allowance against its MSRs, which had a net book value of $6.6 million
as of that date. MSR valuation allowances typically increase in periods of lower market interest rates, which results in a charge
to earnings in the period of the increase. During lower market interest rate environments, such as that which has occurred in recent
months, loan refinance activity and expectations for future loan prepayments generally increase, which typically reduces the fair
value of MSRs and results in an increase in the MSR valuation allowance. However, market interest rates for one- to four-family
mortgage loans as of September 30, 2016, were not sufficiently low enough to generate an MSR valuation allowance as of that date.
However, there can be no assurances that an increase in the MSR valuation allowance will not be required in the future, particularly
if market interest rates for one- to four-family residential loans remain low or decline further. 

Gain on loan sales activities, net, was
$1.4 million and $3.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $586,000 and
$2.1 million during the same periods in 2015, respectively. The Company typically sells most of the fixed-rate, one- to four-family
mortgage loans that it originates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales of these loans were $108.0 million, which
was $23.7 million or 28.1% higher than the same period of 2015. Management attributes this increase to lower market interest rates
for one- to four-family mortgage loans in 2016 compared to 2015. The origination and sale of residential loans are subject to variations
in market interest rates and other factors outside of management s control. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that
such originations and sales will not fluctuate considerably from period to period. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $12,000 and $378,000 in gains on the disposition of certain real estate properties that
it held for investment purposes, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, the gain in 2015 was only $212,000 because of net losses
the Company recorded on the disposition of certain other real estate properties earlier in that year. The Company continues to
actively market certain of the properties that it holds for investment purposes. There can be no assurances that the Company will
be able to sell such properties or that gains or losses on sales, if any, will not fluctuate considerably from period to period. 

Non-Interest Expense   Total
non-interest expense decreased by $1.2 million or 6.6% and $2.7 million or 5.0% during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, respectively. Significant reasons for the changes in the components
of non-interest expense are discussed in the following paragraphs. 

Compensation-related expenses decreased
by $975,000 or 8.5% and $2.5 million or 7.4% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to the same periods in 2015. These decreases were mostly due to lower costs associated with the Company s defined benefit
pension plan, which was due in part to an increase in the discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation,
but also to a freeze of the plan s benefits at the end of 2015. This latter change also resulted in a lengthening of the
amortization period for unrealized losses in the pension plan, which further contributed to lower pension costs in 2016. Also contributing
to the decreases in compensation-related expenses in the 2016 periods compared to the same periods in the prior year was a decline
in the number of employees at the Company. This decline was primarily due to the consolidation of seven retail banking offices
in the third quarter of 2015 and an additional four in the first quarter of 2016. These developments were partially offset by normal
annual merit increases granted to most employees at the beginning of 2016, as well as higher stock-based compensation and employee
commission expense compared to the 2015 periods. 

Occupancy, equipment, and data processing
expenses were $3.3 million and $10.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These amounts
compared to $3.4 million and $10.5 million during the same periods in 2015, respectively. The nine-month period in 2015 included
$269,000 in one-time costs associated with the Company s consolidation of seven retail branch offices in that period. Other
on-going occupancy costs related to these consolidations, as well as four others that were completed in the first quarter of 2016,
declined by $65,000 and $418,000 during the quarter and year-to-date periods in 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2015. However, these cost reductions were partially offset by increased data processing, software, and equipment costs associated
with other initiatives undertaken by the Company in the past few periods. 

Advertising and marketing-related expenses
were $737,000 and $2.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $736,000 and
$1.6 million during the same periods in 2015. The Company has generally increased spending on advertising and marketing in 2016
in an effort to increase sales and expand the Company s overall brand awareness, especially as such relates to the retail
deposit business. Management anticipates that for the entire year 2016 the Company s advertising and marketing-related expenses
are likely to be 20% to 25% higher than they were in 2015. However, this increase depends on future management decisions and there
can be no assurances. 

Federal deposit insurance premiums were
$273,000 and $382,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Year-to-date, these premiums were
$1.1 million in both the 2016 and 2015 periods. Earlier in 2016 the FDIC issued a final rule that changed how insured financial
institutions less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, will be assessed for deposit insurance. The new rule, which
became effective in the third quarter of 2016, resulted in a lower deposit insurance assessment rate for the Company during the
period. 

Net losses and expenses on foreclosed real
estate were $169,000 and $150,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a year-to-date basis
these amounts were $80,000 and $687,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although the third quarter of 2016 was an exception, the
Company has generally experienced lower net losses and expenses related to foreclosed properties in recent periods due to reduced
holdings of such properties. 

Other non-interest expenses were $2.3 million
and $7.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. During these periods the Company elected
to prepay certain fixed-rate FHLB of Chicago advances and incurred prepayment penalties of $134,000 and $341,000, respectively.
These advances had originally been drawn to fund the purchase of mortgage-related securities that were called by the issuer during
the periods, as previously noted. Excluding these prepayment penalties, other non-interest expenses were $2.2 million and $6.7
million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These amounts compared to $2.4 million and $6.9
million during the same periods in 2015, respectively. In 2016 the Company has experienced lower processing costs related to its
ATM network, lower deposit account fraud losses, and lower amortization expense related to certain intangible assets. Also, the
2015 periods included a one-time cost to terminate a contract with a third-party vendor. 

Income Tax Expense   Income
tax expense was $2.5 million and $2.1 million during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was $7.4 million and
$6.3 million during the year-to-date periods in the same years, respectively. The effective tax rates ( ETRs ) for
the quarter periods were 35.8% and 38.6%, respectively, and for the year-to-date periods were $36.5% and 37.4%, respectively. The
Company s ETR will vary from period to period due primarily to the impact of non-taxable revenue items, such as earnings
from BOLI and tax-exempt interest income. The ETR will also vary because of certain tax deductions related to employee exercises
of stock options, which is the primary reason the ETR declined in the 2016 periods. 

Financial Condition  

Overview   The Company s
total assets increased by $151.2 million or 6.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due principally to an increase
in total loans receivable. This increase was primarily funded by increases in deposit liabilities, other borrowings, and advance
payments by borrowers. Also providing funds for the increase in loans receivable was a decrease in mortgage-related securities
during the nine-month period. The Company s total shareholders  equity was $288.9 million at September 30, 2016, compared
to $279.4 million at December 31, 2015 

Mortgage-Related Securities Available-for-Sale  
The Company s portfolio of mortgage-related securities available-for-sale decreased by $28.4 million or 7.0% during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due to normal periodic principal repayments in the portfolio that were partially
offset by the purchase of $56.1 million in securities. 

Changes in the fair value of the Company s
mortgage-related securities available-for-sale are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of deferred income
taxes), which is a component of shareholders  equity. The fair value adjustment on the Company s mortgage-related securities
available-for-sale was a net unrealized gain of $5.2 million at September 30, 2016, compared to a net unrealized gain of $1.2 million
at December 31, 2015. This increase was caused by a decline in market interest rates during the period, which had a favorable impact
on the fair value of the Company s mortgage-related securities. 

Mortgage-Related Securities Held-to-Maturity  
The Company maintains a portfolio of mortgage-related securities held-to-maturity that consists of securities issued and guaranteed
by the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and backed by multi-family residential loans. The Company
has classified these securities has held-to-maturity because it has the ability and intent to hold these securities until they
mature. The Company s portfolio of mortgage-related securities held-to-maturity decreased by $18.0 million or 14.9% during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During this period securities with a carrying value of $16.2 million were called by Fannie
Mae. As a result, the Company recorded call premiums in interest income of $1.1 million, as previously described. The Company did
not purchase any held-to-maturity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Loans Held-for-Sale   The Company s
policy is to sell substantially all of its fixed-rate, one- to four-family mortgage loan originations in the secondary market.
Loans held-for-sale were $8.0 million and $3.4 million at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Loans Receivable   The Company s
loans receivable increased by $185.4 million or 10.7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During this period increases
in multi-family, commercial real estate, and construction loans (net of the undisbursed portion) were partially offset by declines
in most of the Company s other loan categories. Management attributes the increases in part to a low interest rate environment
that has encouraged loan growth in the Company s local markets, particularly for loans secured by multi-family and commercial
real estate. This rate environment has also improved the competitiveness of the Company s loan offerings linked to its interest
rate swap loan program, as noted earlier in this report. Because of this improvement, the Company has been able to increase new
loan production, as well as retain in its loan portfolio a larger portion of construction loans transitioning to permanent financing
than it typically has in prior periods. However, management is not certain that the loan growth experienced in recent periods can
be sustained in the future. The loan portfolio is subject to economic, market, and competitive factors outside of the Company s
control and there can be no assurances that expected loan growth will continue or that total loans will not decrease in future
periods. 

The following table sets forth the Company s
commercial and retail loans that were originated for portfolio during the periods indicated: 

(1)   Excludes
$112.5 million and $83.9 million in loans originated for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In recent months banking regulatory agencies
have publicly expressed increased concern about financial institutions whose holdings of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate
and construction loans and whose growth in such loans exceed guidelines established in certain regulatory pronouncements. Specifically,
financial institutions whose holdings of such loans exceed 300% of total risk-based capital and whose growth in such loans exceeds
50% over the past three years can expect increased scrutiny from their primary regulator. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
holdings of and three-year growth in these types of loans exceed these guidelines. As such, the Company s regulator could
subject its lending operations and risk management controls to increased scrutiny. Although management of the Company is confident
of the quality of its lending operations and controls, it is likely that growth in multi-family and construction loans will be
lower in future periods than it has been in recent periods. Such decline could have a negative impact on the Company s net
interest income and interest rate swap fees in future periods. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights  
The carrying value of the Company s MSRs was $6.6 million at September 30, 2016, and $7.2 million at December 31, 2015, respectively.
The Company maintained no valuation allowance against its MSRs as of either of those dates. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
serviced $1.003 billion in loans for third-party investors compared to $1.039 billion at December 31, 2015. Refer to  Results
of Operations Non-Interest Income,  above, for additional discussion related to the Company s MSRs. 

Deposit Liabilities   The Company s
deposit liabilities increased by $71.5 million or 4.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Transaction deposits, which
consist of checking, savings, and money market accounts, increased by $79.2 million or 6.3% during the period and certificates
of deposit decreased by $7.7 million or 1.4%. Management believes that the increase in transaction deposits in recent periods,
particularly a $55.1 million or 25.8% increase in non-interest-bearing checking accounts, is due in part to improved marketing
and sales efforts. However, management also believes that the low interest rate environment that has persisted for the past few
years has encouraged some customers to switch to transaction deposits in an effort to retain flexibility in the event interest
rates increase in the future. If interest rates increase in the future, customer preference may shift from transaction deposits
back to certificates of deposit, which typically have a higher interest cost to the Company. This development could increase the
Company s cost of funds in the future, which would also have an adverse impact on its net interest margin. 

Borrowings   Borrowings, which
consist of advances from the FHLB of Chicago, increased by $43.0 million or 11.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
This increase was primarily caused by overnight borrowings from the FHLB of Chicago, which were drawn to fund growth in the Company s
earning assets during the period, as previously described. Management believes that additional funds are available to be borrowed
from the FHLB of Chicago or other sources in the future to fund maturing term advances, loan originations, security purchases,
and other corporate purposes, if needed or desirable. However, there can be no assurances of the future availability of borrowings
or any particular level of future borrowings. 

Advance Payments by Borrowers for
Taxes and Insurance    Advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance (i.e., escrow deposits) were $30.2 million at
September 30, 2016, compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2015. Escrow deposits typically increase during the course of the
calendar year until real estate tax obligations are paid, generally in December of each year or January of the following year. 

Shareholders' Equity   The
Company s shareholders  equity was $288.9 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $279.4 million at December 31,
2015. This increase was due to $12.9 million in net income and a $2.4 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
These developments were only partially offset by $7.3 million in regular cash dividends. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
loss was mostly due to an increase in the fair value of available-for-sale securities (net of income tax effect), which was caused
by a decline in market interest rates during the period. The Company did not repurchase a significant amount of its common stock
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The book value of the Company s common stock was $6.32 per share at September
30, 2016, compared to $6.15 at December 31, 2015. 

On November 7, 2016, the Company s
board of directors declared a $0.055 per share dividend payable on November 28, 2016, to shareholders of record on November 18,
2016. For additional discussion relating to the Company s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock refer to
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources,  below. 

Asset Quality   The following
table summarizes non-performing loans and assets as of the dates indicated: 

(1)  Consists
of student loans that are guaranteed under programs sponsored by the U.S. government. 

 (2)  Amounts
shown are for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The Company s non-performing loans
were $9.2 million or 0.48% of loans receivable as of September 30, 2016, compared to $13.6 million or 0.78% of loans receivable
as of December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets, which includes non-performing loans, were $11.9 million or 0.45% of total assets
and $16.9 million or 0.68% of total assets as of these same dates, respectively. The decreases noted in the 2016 figures were primarily
the result of the payoff of a $4.8 million non-performing commercial loan relationship in the third quarter. 

Non-performing assets are classified as
 substandard  in accordance with the Company s internal risk rating policy. In addition to these non-performing
assets, at September 30, 2016, management was closely monitoring $63.8 million in additional loans that were classified as either
 special mention  or  substandard  in accordance with the Company s internal risk rating policy.
This amount compared to $55.9 million at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, most of these additional classified loans
were secured by commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, land, and certain commercial business assets. Management does
not believe any of these loans were impaired as of September 30, 2016, although there can be no assurances that the loans will
not become impaired in future periods. The increase in additional classified loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
was primarily the result of management s assessment that the credit condition of a number of commercial loan relationships,
most of which were manufacturing related, had deteriorated in recent months. 

Trends in the credit quality of the Company s
loan portfolio are subject to many factors that are outside of the Company s control, such as economic and market conditions
that can fluctuate considerably from period to period. As such, there can be no assurances that there will not be significant fluctuations
in the Company s non-performing loans, classified loans, and/or loan charge-off activity from period to period, which may
result in significant variability in the Company s provision for loan losses. 

A summary of the Company s allowance
for loan losses is shown below for the periods indicated: 

(1)    The
rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is annualized. 

The Company s allowance for loan
losses was $19.2 million or 1.00% of loans receivable at September 30, 2016, compared to $17.6 million or 1.01% at December 31,
2015. As a percent of non-performing loans, the Company s allowance for loan losses was 209.8% at September 30, 2016, compared
to 129.5% at December 31, 2015. The reasons for the increase in the dollar amount of the Company s allowance for loan losses
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were described earlier in this report. The significant increase in the allowance
as a percent of non-performing loans during this period was primarily the result of the aforementioned payoff of a non-performing
commercial loan relationship. Management believes the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016, was adequate to cover probable
and estimable losses in the Company s loan portfolio as of that date. However, future increases to the allowance may be necessary
and results of operations could be adversely affected if future conditions differ from the assumptions used by management to determine
the allowance for loan losses as of the end of the period. 

Management is responsible for the timely
and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. Future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based
upon management s assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral, trends in non-performing loans,
current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. To the best of management s knowledge, all known and inherent losses
have been provided for in the allowance for loan losses. 

Refer to  Operating Results Provision
for Loan Losses,  above, for additional discussion. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity   The term  liquidity 
refers to the Company s ability to generate cash flow to fund loan originations, loan purchases, deposit withdrawals, and
operating expenses. The Company s primary sources of funds are deposit liabilities, scheduled payments, prepayments, and
maturities of loans and mortgage-related securities, sales of one- to four-family loans in the secondary market, borrowings from
the FHLB of Chicago, and cash flow provided by the Company s operations. From time-to-time the Company may also sell securities
classified as available-for-sale. Historically, these sources of funds have been adequate to maintain liquidity, with the Company
borrowing correspondingly more in periods in which its operations generate less cash. 

Scheduled payments and maturities of loans
and mortgage-related securities are relatively predictable sources of funds. However, cash flows from customer deposits, calls
of investment securities (if any), prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, loan originations, and draws by borrowers
on unused lines of credit are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions, and/or competition
in the marketplace. These factors increase the variability of cash flows from these sources of funds. 

The Company is committed to maintaining
a strong liquidity position; therefore, management monitors the Company s liquidity position on a daily basis. Based upon
historical experience and available sources of liquidity, management anticipates that the Company will have sufficient funds to
meet current funding commitments. For additional discussion refer to  Financial Condition,  above, and  Qualitative
and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in Part I, Item 3, below. 

Capital Resources   The Company s
ratio of shareholders  equity to total assets was 10.89% at September 30, 2016, compared to 11.17% at December 31, 2015.
This decrease was primarily due to an increase in the Company s total assets during the period, as previously described.
The Company is required to maintain specified amounts of regulatory capital pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Bank ( FRB ). The Company is  well capitalized  for regulatory capital purposes. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.11% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 10.91%. The minimum
ratios to be considered  well capitalized  under current supervisory regulations are 10% for total risk-based capital
and 5% for Tier 1 capital. The minimum ratios to be considered  adequately capitalized  are 8% and 4%, respectively.
For additional discussion refer to  Note 8. Regulatory Capital Requirements  in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  

The payment of dividends or the repurchase
of common stock by the Company is highly dependent on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital
to the Company. Such payments are also subject to any requirements imposed by law or regulations and to the application and interpretation
thereof by the OCC and FRB. The Company cannot provide any assurances that dividends will continue to be paid, the amount of any
such dividends, or whether the Company will choose to or be able to repurchase its common stock in future periods. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments,
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Contingencies  

Contractual Obligations   The
following table presents, as of September 30, 2016, significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties
by payment date (excluding interest payments due in the future on deposits and borrowed funds): 

The Company s operating
lease obligations represent short- and long-term lease and rental payments for facilities, certain software and data processing
equipment, and other equipment. Purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that
are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities
to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation
amounts presented above primarily relate to certain contractual payments for services provided for information technology. 

The Company also has
obligations under its deferred retirement plan for executives and directors as described in Note 10,  Employee Benefit Plans, 
to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, above. 

Commitments to
Extend Credit   The following table details the amounts and expected maturities of approved commitments as of September 30,
2016: 

Commitments to extend
credit, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, unused lines of credit and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements, since these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements   At September 30, 2016, the Company had forward commitments to sell one- to four-family mortgage loans of $22.6
million to Fannie Mae. As described in Note 12,  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk,  to the Company s
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses forward commitments to sell loans to mitigate interest
rate risk on one- to four-family IRLCs and loans held-for-sale. 

Contingent Liabilities  
The Company did not have a material exposure to contingent liabilities as of September 30, 2016. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk   

Gap Analysis  

Repricing characteristics of assets and
liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are  interest rate sensitive 
and by monitoring a financial institution's interest rate sensitivity  gap.  An asset or liability is said to be  interest
rate sensitive  within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity
gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period
and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. 

A gap is considered positive when the amount
of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest-bearing liabilities
maturing or repricing within that specific time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-bearing liabilities
maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within
the same period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected,
absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of
its assets and thus a decrease in the institution's net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected,
absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a
negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest
income. 

The following table presents the amounts
of the Company s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2016, which management
anticipates to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. The information presented in the following table is
based on the following assumptions: 

Loans based upon contractual maturities,
repricing date, if applicable, scheduled repayments of principal, and projected prepayments of principal based upon the Company s
historical experience or anticipated prepayments. Actual cash flows may differ substantially from these assumptions.    

Mortgage-related securities based
upon known repricing dates (if applicable) and an independent outside source for determining estimated prepayment speeds. Actual
cash flows may differ substantially from these assumptions.    

Deposit liabilities based upon contractual
maturities and the Company s historical decay rates. Actual cash flows may differ substantially from these assumptions.    

Borrowings based upon final maturity.    

Based on the above gap analysis, at September
30, 2016, the Company s interest-bearing assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeds its interest-earning liabilities
maturing or repricing within the same period. Based on this information, over the course of the next year net interest income
could be favorably impacted by an increase in market interest rates. Alternatively, net interest income could be unfavorably impacted
by a decrease in market interest rates. However, it should be noted that the Company s future net interest income is affected
by more than just future market interest rates. Net interest income is also affected by absolute and relative levels of earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the level of non-performing loans and other investments, and by other factors outlined
in Part I, Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary
Statement,  as well as Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In addition to not anticipating all of
the factors that could impact future net interest income, gap analysis has certain shortcomings. For example, although certain
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice in similar periods, the interest rates on such react by different degrees to changes
in market interest rates, especially in instances where changes in rates are limited by contractual caps or floors or instances
where rates are influenced by competitive forces. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance
of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. For example,
it is the Company s past experience that rate changes on most of its deposit liabilities generally lag changes in market
interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short
term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment, and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate
significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable-rate
loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Because of these shortcomings, management of the Company believes that gap analysis
is a better indicator of the relative change in the Company s interest rate risk exposure from period to period than it
is an indicator of the direction or amount of future change in net interest income. 

Present Value of Equity   

In addition to the gap analysis table,
management also uses simulation models to monitor interest rate risk. The models report the present value of equity ( PVE )
in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive
assets and liabilities. The PVE is the difference between the present value of expected cash flows of interest rate sensitive assets
and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate
sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e.,
fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, and floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest
rate environment, the fair market value of a fixed-rate asset will decline whereas the fair market value of an adjustable-rate
asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the PVE
whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the PVE. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will
decrease the PVE whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the PVE. 

The following table presents the estimated
present value ratio over a range of interest rate change scenarios at September 30, 2016. The present value ratio is the PVE as
a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. For purposes of this table, management
has made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table. 

Based on the above analysis, the Company s PVE is
generally expected to benefit from changes in market interest rates, although such impact is not expected to be significant.
However, it should be noted that the Company s PVE is impacted by more than changes in market interest rates. Future
PVE is also affected by management s decisions relating to reinvestment of future cash flows, decisions relating to
funding sources, and by other factors outlined in Part I, Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Statement,  above, as well as Part I, Item 1A,
 Risk Factors,  of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As is the case with gap analysis, PVE analysis
also has certain shortcomings. PVE modeling requires management to make assumptions about future changes in market interest rates
that are unlikely to occur, such as immediate, sustained, and parallel (or equal) changes in all market rates across all maturity
terms. PVE modeling also requires that management make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and
costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, it is the Company s past experience that rate changes on
most of its deposit liabilities generally lag changes in market interest rates. In addition, management makes assumptions regarding
the changes in prepayment speeds of mortgage loans and securities. Prepayments will accelerate in a falling rate environment and
the reverse will occur in a rising rate environment. Management also assumes that decay rates on core deposits will accelerate
in a rising rate environment and the reverse in a falling rate environment. The model assumes that the Company will take no action
in response to the changes in interest rates, when in practice rate changes on most deposit liabilities lag behind market changes
and/or may be limited by competition. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in
nature, involve uncertainties, and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the PVE model may provide
an estimate of the Company s interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and
do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company s PVE. Because of these shortcomings,
management of the Company believes that PVE analysis is a better indicator of the relative change in the Company s interest
rate risk exposure from period to period than it is an indicator of the direction or amount of future change in net interest income.
