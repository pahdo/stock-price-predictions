1. Basis of Presentation    
    
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules for interim periods, do not include all of the information and notes for complete financial statements as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Dover Corporation ("Dover" or the "Company") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which provides a more complete understanding of the Company s accounting policies, financial position, operating results, business, properties, and other matters. The year end Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements. Certain amounts in the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   
    
  It is the opinion of management that these financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim results. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. 

2. Acquisitions    
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   four   businesses in separate transactions for net cash consideration of   $501,828  . The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Systems and Fluids segments. 
    
  The following acquisitions were made during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  :

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

The amounts assigned to goodwill and major intangible asset classifications for the   2016   acquisitions are as follows: 

The goodwill identified by these acquisitions reflect the benefits expected to be derived from product line expansion and operational synergies.  Upon consummation of the acquisitions, these businesses are now wholly owned by Dover. 
    
  The Company has substantially completed the purchase price allocations for the 2016 acquisitions as discussed above. As additional information is obtained about these assets and liabilities within the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), the Company will refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately. Purchase price allocation adjustments may arise through working capital adjustments, asset appraisals or to reflect additional facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date. Identified measurement period adjustments will be recorded, including any related impacts to net earnings, in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and may be significant.   See Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   for purchase price adjustments.  
    
  The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings include the results of these businesses from the date of acquisition.   
    
  Pro Forma Information 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma information illustrates the impact of both the acquisitions completed in the nine months ended September 30,   2016   and the   2015   acquisitions on the Company s revenue and earnings from continuing operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . In 2015, the Company acquired   four   businesses in separate transactions for net cash consideration of   $567,843  . 
    
  The   2016   and   2015   pro forma information assumes that the   2016   and   2015   acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the prior year. Pro forma earnings are also adjusted to reflect the comparable impact of additional depreciation and amortization expense (net of tax) resulting from the fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets relating to   2016   and   2015   acquisitions. 

3. Held for Sale, Disposed and Discontinued Operations 
    
  Management evaluates Dover's businesses periodically and may from time to time sell or discontinue certain operations for various reasons.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale  
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell Tipper Tie, a wholly owned subsidiary, for total consideration of approximately   $160,000  , which is subject to normal closing adjustments. Tipper Tie is a global supplier of processing and clip packaging machines.  As of September 30, 2016, Tipper Tie met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The Company classified Tipper Tie s assets and liabilities separately on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and recorded the assets and liabilities at the lesser of the carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. Assets and liabilities held for sale were   $77,370   and   $20,278  , respectively, at September 30, 2016.  
    
  The Tipper Tie business is included in the results of the Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment. The impending sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation.  
    
  The Company had no assets or liabilities classified as held for sale as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Disposed Businesses 
    
  On February 17, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Texas Hydraulics, a custom manufacturer of fluid power components. This disposal did not represent a strategic shift in operations and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. Upon disposal of the business, the Company recognized total proceeds of   $47,300  , which resulted in a gain on sale of   $11,228   included within Other income, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  The results of discontinued operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   reflect the net earnings of businesses held for sale that qualified for presentation as discontinued operations prior to their respective sale dates. On March 2, 2015, the Company completed the sale of Datamax O'Neil for total proceeds of   $185,000  , which resulted in a net gain on sale of   $87,781  . On April 24, 2015, the Company completed the sale of Sargent Aerospace for total proceeds of   $500,000  , which resulted in a net gain on sale of   $177,800  . 
    
  Summarized results of the Company s discontinued operations are as follows:

5. Property, Plant and Equipment, net   

Depreciation expense totaled   $42,786   and   $38,191   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation expense was   $132,316   and   $116,807  , respectively.  

6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    
    
  The following table provides the changes in carrying value of goodwill by segment for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

As noted in   Note 3 Held for Sale, Disposed and Discontinued Operations  , the Company completed the sale of its Texas Hydraulics business during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . As a result of this sale, the Engineered Systems goodwill balance was reduced by   $9,615  .  Additionally, the Company has classified Tipper Tie's assets and liabilities as held for sale.  As a result, the Refrigeration   Food Equipment goodwill balance was reduced by   $25,673  .  
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded adjustments totaling   $5,991   to goodwill relating to purchase price adjustments as a result of working capital adjustments and refinements of estimates to assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the   2015   acquisitions of Gemtron, JK Group, Gala Industries, Xylon and Reduction Engineering Scheer. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded adjustments of   $6,892   and   $24,092  , respectively, to goodwill as a result of working capital and purchase price adjustments for the   2016   acquisitions of Tokheim, Fairbanks, and ProGauge. These adjustments are included in the acquisitions line in the table above. 
    
  In accordance with the applicable accounting standard, Dover performs its annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition to the annual impairment test, the Company is required to regularly assess whether a triggering event has occurred which would require interim impairment testing. The Company has considered the economic environments in which its businesses operate, particularly those reporting units exposed to the decline in oil and gas markets, and the long-term outlook for those businesses. The Company has determined that a triggering event has not occurred which would require impairment testing in the third quarter of 2016.

The following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible assets: 

Amortization expense totaled   $43,937   and   $38,983   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization expense was   $131,105   and   $118,576  , respectively.  

7. Restructuring Activities 
    
  The following table details restructuring charges incurred by segment for the periods presented: 

The restructuring expenses of   $7,748   and   $31,334   incurred in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, are related to restructuring programs initiated during   2016   and   2015  . These programs are designed to better align the Company's costs and operations with current market conditions through targeted facility consolidations, headcount reductions and other measures to further optimize operations. The Company expects the programs currently underway to be substantially completed in the next twelve to eighteen months.   
    
  The   $7,748   of restructuring charges incurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   primarily included the following items: 

The Energy segment recorded   $5,170     of restructuring charges related to various programs across the segment focused on workforce reductions and field and facility consolidations. These programs were initiated to better align cost base with the current demand environment.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

The Engineered Systems segment recorded   $1,293     of restructuring charges related to headcount reductions across various businesses primarily related to optimization of administrative functions within the Printing   Identification platform and U.S. manufacturing consolidation within the Industrial platform.    

The Fluids segment recorded   $1,139     of restructuring charges principally related to headcount reductions and facility consolidations at various businesses across the segment.    

The Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment recorded   $146     of restructuring charges related primarily to headcount reductions.     
       
  The following table details the Company s severance and other restructuring accrual activity: 

The accrual balance at   September 30, 2016   primarily reflects restructuring plans initiated during the year, as well as ongoing lease commitment obligations for facilities closed in earlier periods. 

8. Borrowings    
    
  Borrowings consist of the following: 

The Company adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016 which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified   $13,687   from other assets and deferred charges to long-term debt to reflect this guidance in the comparable balance as of   December 31, 2015  . 

11 

     Table of Contents  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

The Company maintains a   $1.0 billion   five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks which expires on   November 10, 2020  .   The Company was in compliance with its revolving credit and other long-term debt covenants at September 30, 2016 and had a coverage ratio of 9.2 to 1.0.   The Company primarily uses this facility as liquidity back-up for its commercial paper program and has not drawn down any loans under the facility and does not anticipate doing so. The Company generally uses commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, funding of acquisitions, and repurchases of its common stock. 
    
  On September 16, 2016, the Company entered into a   $500 million   unsecured term loan facility (the  Term Loan Agreement ) with a syndicate of banks.  Any borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will mature on the one year anniversary of the drawing of the term loans.  The Company has not drawn down on the Term Loan Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Interest expense and interest income for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Letters of Credit 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $101,241   outstanding in letters of credit and guarantees with financial institutions which expire at various dates within   2016   through   2024  . These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty, and other performance obligations.   

9. Financial Instruments    
    
  Derivatives  
    
  The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of its operations and certain commodity risks. In order to manage these risks the Company has hedged portions of its forecasted sales and purchases to occur within the next twelve months that are denominated in non-functional currencies, with currency forward or collar contracts designated as cash flow hedges. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had contracts with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts of   $64,482   and   $37,735  , respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the Chinese Yuan, Pound Sterling, U.S. Dollar, Swedish Krona, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Swiss Franc. The Company believes it is probable that all forecasted cash flow transactions will occur.  
    
  In addition, the Company had outstanding contracts with a total notional amount of   $65,048   and   $51,369   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, that are not designated as hedging instruments. These instruments are used to reduce the Company's exposure for operating receivables and payables that are denominated in non-functional currencies.  
    
  The following table sets forth the fair values of derivative instruments held by the Company as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and the balance sheet lines in which they are recorded: 

The amount of gains or losses from hedging activity recorded in earnings is not significant, and the amount of unrealized gains and losses from cash flow hedges that are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not significant; therefore, additional tabular disclosures are not presented. There are no amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and the Company's derivative instruments that are subject to credit risk contingent features were not significant.

  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the Company; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as the Company s policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.  
    
  Additionally, the Company has designated the    300.0 million   of Euro-denominated notes issued December 4, 2013 as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated operations. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the Euro-denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment. Accordingly, changes in the value of the Euro-denominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings to offset changes in the value of the net investment in Euro-denominated operations.  
    
  Gains (losses) on net investment hedges are recognized in other comprehensive earnings (losses) as a part of foreign currency translation adjustments as follows: 

Fair Value Measurements  
    
  Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.  
    
  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
    
  Level 2 inputs include inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities.  
    
  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  
    
  The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

In addition to fair value disclosure requirements related to financial instruments carried at fair value, accounting standards require interim disclosures regarding the fair value of all of the Company s financial instruments.  
    
  The estimated fair value of long-term debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $3,104,447   and   $2,880,734  , respectively, compared to the carrying value of   $2,613,761   and   $2,603,655  , respectively. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, accounts payable, and notes payable are reasonable estimates of their fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  
    
  We also have assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment, allocation of purchase price in an acquisition or when a new liability is being established that requires fair value measurement. These include long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment. The fair value measurements related to each of these rely primarily on Company-specific inputs and the Company's assumptions about the use of the assets. Since certain of the Company s assumptions would involve inputs that are not observable, these fair values would reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

10. Income Taxes    
    
  The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   28.2%   and   24.0%  , respectively.   Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rates for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   28.0%   and   27.3%  , respectively.   The discrete items for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from the adjustment of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed. The discrete items for the three months ended September 30, 2015 principally resulted from the conclusion of certain state tax audits and an adjustment of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the prior comparable period is principally due to the adjustments of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed.     
    
  The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   26.5%   and   27.2%  , respectively.   Excluding discrete items  , the effective tax rates for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   27.8%   and   28.5%  , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     relative to the prior comparable period is primarily due to the revaluation of deferred tax balances as a result of a tax rate reduction in a non U.S. jurisdiction.    
    
  Dover and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S., including various state and local returns, and in other foreign jurisdictions.  We believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. The Company is routinely audited by taxing authorities in its filing jurisdictions, and a number of these audits are currently underway. The Company believes that within the next twelve months uncertain tax positions may be resolved and statutes of limitations will expire, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately     zero   to   $18,179  . 

11. Equity Incentive Program    
    
  The Company typically grants equity awards annually at its regularly scheduled first quarter meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. During the first and second quarters of   2016  , the Company issued stock-settled appreciation rights ("SARs") covering   1,346,354   shares, performance share awards of   79,561   and restricted stock units of   244,707  .  

14 

     Table of Contents  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated) 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each SAR on the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on Dover's stock price history, including implied volatilities from traded options on Dover stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate SAR exercise and employee termination patterns within the valuation model. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the SARs is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
    
  The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the SARs awarded during the respective periods are as follows: 

The performance share awards granted in   2016   and   2015   are considered performance condition awards as attainment is based on Dover's performance relative to established internal metrics. The fair value of these awards was determined using Dover's closing stock price on the date of grant.  The expected attainment of the internal metrics for these awards is analyzed each reporting period, and the related expense is adjusted based on expected attainment, if that attainment differs from previous estimates. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in attainment is recognized in selling and administrative expenses in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.    
    
  The fair value and average attainment used in determining stock-based compensation cost for the performance shares issued in    2016   and   2015   is as follows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Stock-based compensation is reported within selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  The following table summarizes the Company s compensation expense relating to all stock-based incentive plans:

12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities    
    
  Litigation 
    
  A few of the Company s subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to the cleanup of waste disposal sites identified under federal and state statutes that provide for the allocation of such costs among "potentially responsible parties." In each instance, the extent of the Company s liability appears to be very small in relation to the total projected expenditures and the number of other "potentially responsible parties" involved and is anticipated to be immaterial to the Company. In addition, a few of the Company s subsidiaries are involved in ongoing remedial activities at certain current and former plant sites, in cooperation with regulatory agencies, and appropriate reserves have been established. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has reserves totaling   $30,463   and   $30,595  , respectively, for environmental and other matters, including private party claims for exposure to hazardous substances, that are probable and estimable. 
    
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal proceedings incidental to their businesses. These proceedings primarily involve claims by private parties alleging injury arising out of use of the Company s products, patent infringement, employment matters, and commercial disputes. Management and legal counsel, at least quarterly, review the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued to-date, and the availability and extent of insurance coverage. The Company has reserves for legal matters that are probable and estimable and not otherwise covered by insurance, and at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these reserves are not significant. While it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these legal actions, in the opinion of management, based on the aforementioned reviews, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  Warranty Accruals 
    
  Estimated warranty program claims are provided for at the time of sale. Amounts provided for are based on historical costs and adjusted for new claims. The changes in the carrying amount of product warranties through   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

13. Employee Benefit Plans    
    
  Retirement Plans 
    
  The Company offers defined contribution retirement plans which cover the majority of its U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. In addition, the Company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The plans  benefits are generally based on years of service and employee compensation. The Company also provides to certain management employees, through non-qualified plans, supplemental retirement benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law. 
    
  The following tables set forth the components of the Company s net periodic expense relating to retirement benefit plans:

Post-Retirement Plans 
    
  The Company also maintains post retirement benefit plans, although these plans are effectively closed to new entrants.  The supplemental and post retirement benefit plans are supported by the general assets of the Company. The following table sets forth the components of the Company s net periodic expense relating to its post-retirement benefit plans: 

The total amount amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive earnings into net periodic pension and post-retirement expense totaled   $3,695   and   $5,753   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016    and   2015  , respectively, and   $11,084   and   $17,316   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Defined Contribution Retirement Plans 
    
  The Company also offers defined contribution retirement plans which cover the majority of its U.S. employees, as well as employees in certain other countries. The Company s expense relating to defined contribution plans was   $8,153  , and   $7,601   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $26,310   and   $24,612   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) to earnings (loss) during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

The Company recognizes net periodic pension cost, which includes amortization of net actuarial losses and prior service costs, in both selling and administrative expenses and cost of goods and services, depending on the functional area of the underlying employees included in the plans.  
    
  Cash flow hedges consist mainly of foreign currency forward contracts. The Company recognizes the realized gains and losses on its cash flow hedges in the same line item as the hedged transaction, such as revenue, cost of goods and services, or selling and administrative expenses.

15. Segment Information    
    
  For management reporting and performance evaluation purposes, the Company categorizes its operating companies into   four   distinct reportable segments. Segment financial information and a reconciliation of segment results to consolidated results is as follows:  

(1)    
    Certain expenses are maintained at the corporate level and not allocated to the segments. These expenses include executive and functional compensation costs, non-service pension costs, non-operating insurance expenses, and various administrative expenses relating to the corporate headquarters. 

16. Share Repurchases    
    
  During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   no   shares of common stock. 
    
  In January 2015, the Board of Directors approved a standing share repurchase authorization, whereby the Company may  repurchase up to   15,000,000   shares of its common stock over the following three years. This plan replaced all previously authorized repurchase programs. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   6,771,458   shares available for repurchase under this plan.  
    
  A summary of share repurchase activity during the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   is as follows:

  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the information used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share: 

The following table is a reconciliation of the share amounts used in computing earnings per share: 

Diluted earnings per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and SARs, and vesting of performance shares and restricted shares, as determined using the treasury stock method.   
    
  The weighted average number of anti-dilutive potential common shares excluded from the calculation above were approximately   21,000   and   47,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   31,000   and   44,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

18. Recent Accounting Standards    
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15  ,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the emerging issues take force).   This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies  (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.  The Company does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The ASU changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases,   which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This ASU also provides clarifications surrounding the presentation of the effects of leases in the income statement and statement of cash flows. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating this new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , that introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance will be effective for the Company January 1, 2018. The FASB has also issued the following standards which clarify ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard: ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   and     ASU 2016-10   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  .  The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are required to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this guidance. The Company adopted this guidance January 1, 2016. As a result of adoption, debt issuance costs of   $13,687   were reclassified from assets to reduce long-term-debt as of December 31, 2015.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  .  Under this guidance the cumulative impact of purchase accounting adjustments arising during the one year measurement period from the date of acquisition will be recognized, in full, in the period identified. This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and will be applied prospectively to adjustments arising after that date.  There was no impact to the financial statements of adoption of this standard.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results     of Operations 
    
  Refer to the section below entitled "Special Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained below and throughout this quarterly report. 
    
  Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A"), we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance as well as liquidity, including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. Explanations within this MD A provide more details on the use and derivation of these measures. 

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK       
    
  Dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration   Food Equipment. The Company's entrepreneurial business model encourages, promotes, and fosters deep customer engagement and collaboration, which has led to Dover's well-established and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industry-leading product innovation. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to "Dover," "the Company," and words such as "we," "us," and "our" include Dover Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
    
  Dover's four segments are as follows:    

Our Energy segment, serving the Drilling   Production, Bearings   Compression, and Automation end markets, is a provider of customer-driven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of fuels worldwide and has a strong presence in the bearings and compression components and automation markets.    

Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Printing   Identification and Industrials, and is focused on the design, manufacture and service of critical equipment and components serving the fast-moving consumer goods, digital textile printing, vehicle service, environmental solutions and industrial end markets.    

Our Fluids segment, serving the Fluid Transfer and Pumps end markets, is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the retail fueling, chemical, hygienic, oil and gas, and industrial end markets.    

Our Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food service end markets.    
       
  The following table shows the percentage of total revenue and segment earnings generated by each of our four segments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

Third   quarter of   2016   revenue of   $1.7 billion     decreased     4.5%   from   $1.8 billion  , as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Results were driven by an organic revenue   decline   of   6.8%  , principally within our Energy segment, a decrease due to disposed businesses of   3.4%  , and   an unfavorable   impact from foreign currency translation of   0.6%  . This decline was partially offset by acquisition-related revenue   growth   of   6.3%  , primarily within the Fluids segment. 
    
  The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by our Energy segment, and to a lesser extent, Fluids segment as a result of weakness in U.S. oil and gas-related end markets from the current year compared to the prior year. Additionally, organic growth in our Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment declined by   1.7%   primarily due to reduced activity in our can-shaping business.   
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

The decline in organic revenue was partially offset by organic revenue growth of   0.9%   in our Engineered Systems segment driven by our Printing   Identification platform. 
    
  From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. and China activities declined organically, on both a sequential basis from the second quarter and on a year over year basis. On an organic basis, our European markets improved sequentially from the second quarter and year over year.  
    
  We continue to adjust our cost structure to better align with the current economic environment. During the   third   quarter of 2016,  previously announced plans resulted in restructuring charges of   $7.7 million  . These actions were primarily within our Energy segment with charges of   $5.2 million  . We currently expect full year   2016   restructuring expenses of approximately $40.0 million to $44.0 million. We expect to realize cost savings of approximately $95.0 million to $105.0 million in 2016 as a result of programs previously initiated as well as those enacted in 2016.   
    
  We completed the acquisition of the dispenser and system businesses of Tokheim Group S.A.S ("Tokheim") in the first quarter of 2016, as well as the acquisition of two smaller businesses in the retail fueling space in the second quarter of 2016.  These businesses joined our Fluid Transfer end market within the Fluids segment and will enable us to provide an end-to-end solution to our global retail fueling customers.  In the third quarter of 2016, we also acquired a small automation and data analytics business in the Engineered Systems segment.  The total aggregate purchase price of these four acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was   $501.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . Subsequent to the third quarter of 2016, on October 3, 2016, we acquired Ravaglioli S.p.A Group ("RAV"), a global automotive service equipment manufacturer, for approximately $274 million, which will become part of our Engineered Systems segment.   
    
  Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire Wayne Fueling Systems Ltd. ("Wayne") for $780 million, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.  Wayne is a global provider of fuel dispensing, payment systems and aftermarket services for retail and commercial fuel stations.  Upon close, Wayne will join our Fluids segment.  
    
  Due to several factors, we have reduced full-year expectations for revenue and earnings per share. The primary factors driving this revision are generally weaker capital spending across several industrial end-markets, continued weakness in longer cycle oil  and gas exposed markets, and ongoing production inefficiencies in our retail refrigeration business.  Therefore, we have lowered our full year revenue growth expectations and our full year earnings per share guidance. We now expect full year revenue to decline approximately 4% to 5%. Within this forecast, organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. Our forecast for foreign currency exchange and acquisition growth, net of dispositions, is unchanged.  In total, full year earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.00 - $3.05.

  Revenue 
    
  Revenue for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $79.8 million  , or   4.5%  , from the comparable period. Results were driven by an organic revenue   decline   of   6.8%  , principally within our Energy segment, a decrease due to disposed businesses of   3.4%  , and   an unfavorable   impact from foreign currency translation of   0.6%  .  This decline was partially offset by acquisition-related revenue   growth   of   6.3%  , primarily within the Fluids segment.  
    
  Revenue for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $245.3 million  , or   4.7%  , from the comparable period.  The   decrease   primarily reflects organic revenue   decline   of   6.9%  , driven by weaknesses in oil and gas markets.  Growth of   5.9%   related to acquisitions was offset by a decrease due to disposed businesses of   2.8%   and   an unfavorable   impact from foreign currency of   0.9%  .  
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $40.8 million  , or   6.1%  , from the comparable period, consistent with the declining revenues for the period. Gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points primarily driven by lower revenue as well as by production inefficiencies in our Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment. 
    
  Gross profit for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $102.1 million  , or   5.2%  , from the comparable period, consistent with declining revenues for the period, and gross profit margin decreased slightly by 20 basis points.  
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses 
    
  Selling and administrative expenses for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $25.4 million  , or   6.4%  , from the comparable period, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions, including the related depreciation and amortization expense, as well as increased investment in shared services, offset by lower restructuring charges and by the benefits of previously implemented cost reduction actions. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses increased 260 basis points in   2016   to   24.7%

compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting deleveraging of fixed administrative costs and acquisition-related costs on lower revenue. 
    
  Selling and administrative expenses for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $68.9 million  , or   5.6%  , from the comparable period, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions, including the related depreciation and amortization expense, as well as increased investment in shared services, offset by lower restructuring charges of   $6.5 million  .  As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses increased 260 basis points as compared to the prior year period due to the same drivers as noted for the quarter over quarter period. 
    
  Non-Operating Items 
    
  Interest expense, net 
    
  Net interest expense for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $1.0 million  , or   3.2%  , from the comparable period. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on higher average balances of commercial paper, offset by a lower interest rate on $400.0 million notes issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 that replaced the $300.0 million notes with a higher interest rate. 
    
  Net interest expense for the   nine months     ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $0.9 million  , or   0.9%  , from the comparable period, primarily due to higher interest rates on higher average balances of commercial paper, offset by lower interest on the aforementioned notes. 
    
  Other income, net 
    
  Other income of   $3.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily consists of $1.8 million of earnings from unconsolidated investments, $0.4 million of foreign currency exchange gains resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated balances, and the remainder due to several other items, none of which were individually significant.  The prior year income of   $0.4 million   includes $0.3 million of earnings from unconsolidated investments, offset by $0.3 million of foreign exchange losses.  The prior year income also included several other items totaling $0.4 million of income, none of which were individually significant. 
    
  Other income of   $19.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily consists of the   $11.2 million   pre-tax gain on the sale of Texas Hydraulics, $3.6 million of earnings from unconsolidated investments, and $2.8 million of foreign currency exchange gains resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated balances.  The prior year income of   $5.8 million   primarily reflects a $3.6 million one-time favorable insurance settlement, a $1.2 million favorable legal settlement, and $2.3 million of earnings from unconsolidated investments.  The income items were offset by approximately $1.1 million of foreign exchange losses from the remeasurement of balances denominated in foreign currencies.   
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   28.2%   and   24.0%  , respectively.   Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rates for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   28.0%   and   27.3%  , respectively.   The discrete items for the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from the adjustment of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed. The discrete items for the three months ended September 30, 2015 principally resulted from the conclusion of certain state tax audits and an adjustment of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the prior comparable period is principally due to the adjustments of the tax accounts to the U.S. tax return filed.

The effective tax rates for continuing operations for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   26.5%   and   27.2%  , respectively.   Excluding discrete items  , the effective tax rates for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   27.8%   and   28.5%  , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     relative to the prior comparable period is primarily due to the revaluation of deferred tax balances as a result of a tax rate reduction in a non U.S. jurisdiction. 
    
  Additionally, in the second quarter of 2015, we generated a $325.0 million gain for tax purposes on the sale of Sargent Aerospace. The tax liability resulting from the sale was $108.0 million which reflects utilization of the $8.6 million tax benefit generated in the first quarter of   2015   by the sale of Datamax O'Neil. This gain and related tax provision are reflected within discontinued operations.   See Note 3 Held for Sale, Disposed and Discontinued Operations   in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
    
  Dover and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S., including various state and local returns, and in other foreign jurisdictions.  We believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. The Company is routinely audited by taxing authorities in its filing jurisdictions, and a number of these audits are currently underway. The Company believes that within the next twelve months uncertain tax positions may be resolved and statutes of limitations will expire, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits of approximately     zero   to   $18.2 million  . 
    
  Earnings from Continuing Operations 
    
  Earnings from continuing operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     30.2%   to   $130.1 million  , or   $0.83   diluted earnings per share.  Earnings from continuing operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     24.3%   to   $347.7 million  , or   $2.22   diluted earnings per share. The   decrease   in earnings is primarily the result of weak market conditions in our Energy segment, and to a lesser extent, those businesses within our Fluids segment exposed to oil and gas markets.  Earnings was also impacted by increased acquisition-related depreciation and amortization and deal costs primarily in our Fluids segment and production inefficiencies in our Refrigeration   Food Equipment segment.  These results were partially offset by earnings improvements in our Engineered Systems segment, most notably in our Printing   Identification businesses where leverage on volume and operational improvements offset the decline in volume seen in in our Industrials platform.  The   decrease   in earnings per share for the    nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects the   decrease   in earnings, offset by lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2016 period relative to the prior year.  
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  The results of discontinued operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   reflect the net earnings of businesses that were held for sale that qualified for presentation as discontinued operations prior to their sale dates. We completed the sale of Datamax O'Neil in the first quarter of 2015 for a gain of   $87.8 million  . We also sold Sargent Aerospace in the second quarter of 2015 for a gain of   $177.8 million  . These gains are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations.  
    
  Restructuring Activities    
    
  The restructuring expenses of   $7.7 million   and   $31.3 million   incurred in the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, relate to restructuring programs initiated during   2016   and   2015  . These programs are designed to better align our costs and operations with current market conditions through targeted facility consolidations, headcount reductions and other measures. We currently expect full year   2016   restructuring expenses of approximately   $40.0 million  , inclusive of our actions taken to date, principally within our Energy and Fluids segments. We expect the programs currently underway to be substantially completed in the next twelve to eighteen months.   
    
  The   $7.7 million   of restructuring charges incurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   primarily included the following items: 

The Energy segment recorded   $5.2 million     of restructuring charges related to various programs across the segment focused on workforce reductions and field and facility consolidations. These programs were initiated to better align cost base with the current demand environment. 

The Engineered Systems segment recorded   $1.3 million     of restructuring charges related to headcount reductions across various businesses primarily related to optimization of administrative functions within the Printing   Identification platform and U.S. manufacturing consolidation within the Industrial platform.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions, while managing our capital structure on a short and long-term basis. 
    
  Cash Flow Summary 
    
  The following table is derived from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: 

Operating Activities 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   approximately   $59.5 million   compared to the comparable period in   2015  . This   decrease   was primarily the result of lower earnings from continuing operations, and higher inventories, offset by decreases in employee bonus payments year over year. 
    
  We also believe adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing changes caused solely by revenue. Adjusted working capital from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016      increased     $6.1 million   in   2016  , or   0.5%  , to   $1.3 billion  , which reflected   an increase   of   $25.4 million   in inventory and   an increase   of   $78.6 million   in accounts receivable, offset by   an increase   in accounts payable of   $97.9 million  . 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash provided by or used in investing activities generally results from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions, offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and property, plant and equipment. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we used cash through investing activities of   $561.4 million   as compared to cash provided of   $581.0 million   for the same period of   2015  , driven mainly by the following factors: 

Proceeds from the sale of businesses:   For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated cash of   $47.3 million   from the sale of Texas Hydraulics.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we generated cash of   $689.3 million   from the sales of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace. 

Acquisitions:   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we deployed approximately   $501.8 million  , net, to acquire Tokheim, Fairbanks, and ProGauge within the Fluids segment and Alliance Wireless Technologies in the Engineered Systems segment. In comparison, during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we acquired one business for a net aggregate cash purchase price of approximately   $6.5 million  . 

Capital spending:   Our capital expenditures   increased     $4.5 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily within the Fluids segment. We expect full year   2016   capital expenditures to approximate 2.3% of revenue. 
       
  We anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make through the remainder of   2016   will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and through the issuance of commercial paper, use of established lines of credit or public or private debt or equity markets, as necessary.

Financing Activities 
    
  Our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for the repurchase of our common stock and payments of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercises of stock options. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we generated cash totaling   $149.3 million   and used cash totaling   $1.1 billion  , respectively, for financing activities, with the activity primarily attributable to the following: 

Share purchases:   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock compared to repurchases of   $600.2 million   for the same period in 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the approximate number of shares available for repurchase under the January 2015 share repurchase authorization was   6.8 million  .  

Commercial paper and notes payable:    Commercial paper and notes payable, net, increased during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   by   $355.3 million  , as we borrowed $316.4 million to fund the acquisition of Tokheim. We subsequently utilized proceeds from the sale of Texas Hydraulics and cash to pay down $47.3 million of commercial paper.  We also borrowed $179.0 million in anticipation of the acquisition of RAV completed on October 3, 2016. Commercial paper decreased in the comparable period in 2015 by $316.8 million, utilizing proceeds from 2015 sales of businesses. We primarily use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, as well as to fund acquisitions and repurchase common stock.   

Net proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards  : Proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards were   $3.2 million     higher   in   2016   as compared to the prior year. These proceeds have declined in recent periods as the number of stock options outstanding is diminishing and a larger number of cashless exercises of equity awards have occurred. Payments to settle tax obligations on these exercises   increased     $8.2 million   in   2016  . 
       
  Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations 
    
  Cash used in discontinued operations of   $93.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   reflect the operating results of Sargent Aerospace and Datamax O'Neil prior to their sale. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
    
  In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures as set forth in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. 
    
  The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: 

For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated free cash flow of   $457.2 million  , representing   9.1%   of revenue and   131.5%   of net earnings from continuing operations. Free cash flow in   2016     decreased     $64.0 million   over the prior year primarily  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

due to lower cash flow provided by operations.  Based on historical performance, we are targeting to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue for the full year 2016. 
    
  Capitalization 
    
  We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock.  In addition, we maintain a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which will expire on November 10, 2020. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program. We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so. We were in compliance with revolving credit facility and our other long-term debt covenants at   September 30, 2016   and had a coverage ratio of   9.2 to 1.0  . We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants.  
    
  On September 16, 2016, we entered into a $500 million unsecured term loan facility (the  Term Loan Agreement ) with a syndicate of banks.  The Term Loan Agreement is intended to be used to fund a portion of the funds required for our acquisition of Wayne, or to refinance other indebtedness incurred for such acquisition. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will mature on the one year anniversary of the drawing of the term loans.  We have not drawn down on the Term Loan Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents totaled   $514.8 million  , of which $478.7 million was held outside the United States. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment-grade money market instruments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less. We regularly invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months.      
    
  We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents.  Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: 

Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to   40.8%   at   September 30, 2016   from   39.6%   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in this ratio was driven primarily by the increase in our net capitalization of   $364.7 million   due to higher commercial paper of   $356.1 million   and offset by higher cash and cash equivalents of   $152.6 million  . 
    
  Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were revised as follows as of June 30, 2016 and remain the same at   September 30, 2016  :

Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt.  We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.  
    
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related public financial information are based on the application of GAAP which requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported.  These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied.  We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  In accordance with the applicable accounting standard, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year.  In addition to the annual impairment test, we are required to regularly assess whether a triggering event has occurred which would require interim impairment testing. We have considered the economic environments in which our  businesses operate, particularly within those reporting units exposed to the decline in oil and gas markets, and the long-term outlook for those businesses. We have determined that a triggering event has not occurred which would require impairment testing in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  Recent Accounting Standards 
    
  See Part 1, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,   Note 18 Recent Accounting Standards  .  The adoption of recent accounting standards as included in   Note 18 Recent Accounting Standards   in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our revenue, earnings or liquidity. 
    
  Special Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, especially "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Such statements relate to, among other things, operating and strategic plans, income, earnings, cash flows, foreign exchange, changes in operations, acquisitions, industries in which Dover businesses operate, anticipated market conditions and our positioning, global economies, and operating improvements. Forward-looking statements may be indicated by words or phrases such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "suggests," "will," "plans," "should," "would," "could," and "forecast," or the use of the future tense and similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, including, but not limited to, oil and natural gas demand, production growth, and prices; changes in exploration and production spending by Dover s customers and changes in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development; changes in customer demand and capital spending; economic conditions generally and changes in economic conditions globally and in markets served by Dover businesses, including well activity and U.S. industrials activity; Dover s ability to achieve expected savings from integration and other cost-control initiatives, such as lean and productivity programs as well as efforts to reduce sourcing input costs; the impact of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the ability of Dover's businesses to expand into new geographic markets; Dover's ability to identify and successfully consummate value-adding acquisition opportunities or planned divestitures; the impact of loss of a significant customer, or loss or non-renewal of significant contracts; the ability of Dover's businesses to develop and launch new products, timing of such launches and risks relating to market acceptance by customers; the relative mix of products and services which impacts margins and operating efficiencies; increased competition and pricing pressures; the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility; short-term capacity constraints; increases in the cost of raw materials; domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes or developments, including environmental regulations, conflict minerals disclosure requirements, tax policies, trade sanctions, and

export/import laws; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights; the impact of legal matters and legal compliance risks; conditions and events affecting domestic and global financial and capital markets; and a downgrade in Dover's credit ratings which, among other matters, could make obtaining financing more difficult and costly. Dover refers you to the documents that it files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as its reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from its current expectations and from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Dover undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.

  Non-GAAP Disclosures 
  In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose non-GAAP information that we believe provides useful information to investors. Segment EBITDA, segment EBITDA margin, free cash flow, net debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, earnings, revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  We believe that segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We do not present segment net income because corporate expenses are not allocated at a segment level.  Segment EBITDA margin is calculated as segment EBITDA divided by segment revenue. Definition uses and reconciliations of free cash flow, net debt, and net capitalization can be found above in this Item 2, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." We believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers. We believe that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   ("Form 10-K"). 

Item 4  .   Controls and Procedures 
    
  At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
