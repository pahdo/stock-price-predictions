Overview       Glucose Health, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 27, 2007. Our principal executive office is located at 609 SW 8th Street, Suite 600, Bentonville, AR 72712 and our telephone number is 479-802-3827. Our corporate website is www.glucosehealthinc.com and our product website is www.glucosehealth.com. Our CUSIP number is 379894108 and trading symbol is GLUC. We are a manufacturer of dietary supplement products and our business focus is serving the consumer market segment of persons concerned with pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes. As discussed in greater detail below, our principal product is Glucose Health    Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance. We acquired this product in the fourth quarter of 2014 and we are in the early stages of manufacturing, marketing and distributing this product. We have a history of losses.        Corporate Information        We were incorporated under the laws of State of Nevada on March 27, 2007, as Bio-Solutions Corp.      On October 17, 2012, our Board of Directors and shareholders holding a majority of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to written consents in lieu of a meeting, approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital (the  amendment ). The amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 17, 2012, increasing our authorized capital from 90,000,000 shares of common stock, to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001.     On January 10, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors unanimously voted to reverse split the Company s common stock on the basis of one share of the Company s common stock for each 10 shares outstanding while maintaining the authorized capital structure of the Company at 200,000,000 shares. The Board resolution set the date of record for shareholder approval for January 14, 2014. As of January 29, 2014, the Company obtained written consent in lieu of a meeting of the shareholders to authorize a reverse split of the Company s common stock. Shareholders owning a total of 100,992,469 shares of the Company s common stock voted in favor of the reverse split. There were a total of 199,611,900 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of January 14, 2014 (the date of record). The number of shares of common stock voting in favor of the reverse split was sufficient for approval. On February 4, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada effecting a 1-for-10 reverse split pursuant to which every ten shares of the Company s common stock were combined and converted into one share of the Company s common stock (with all fractional shares resulting there from being rounded up to the next whole share) with the total number of shares of the Company s authorized common stock remaining at 200,000,000 shares. The effective date of the above corporate action was February 26, 2014.                   7       
      Table of Contents          On October 30, 2014, the board of directors of the Company voted to reverse split the Company s common stock on the basis of one share of the Company s common stock for each 50 shares outstanding while maintaining the authorized capital structure of the Company at 200,000,000 shares; to authorize 1,000 shares of preferred stock with  blank check  rights; and to change the Company s name from Bio-Solutions Corp. to Glucose Health, Inc. (the  corporate action ). The board resolution set the date of record for shareholder approval of the corporate action for October 31, 2014 and the effective date of the corporate action for November 19, 2014. As of October 31, 2014, the Company obtained written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders to authorize the corporate action. Shareholders owning a total of 30,596,154 shares of the Company s common stock voted in favor of the corporate action. There were a total of 60,132,271 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2014 (the date of record). The number of shares of common stock voting in favor of the corporate action was sufficient for approval. On November 5, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting, as of November 19, 2014, the 1-for-50 reverse split pursuant to which every fifty shares of the Company s common stock were combined and converted into one share of the Company s common stock (with all fractional shares being rounded up to the next whole share) with the total number of shares of the Company s authorized common stock remaining at 200,000,000 shares; effecting the authorization of 1,000 shares of preferred stock with  blank check  rights; and effecting the change of the Company s name from Bio-Solutions Corp. to Glucose Health, Inc. On November 20, 2015, the board of directors voted to designate Series A Special Preferred Shares consisting of 1,000 shares of preferred stock with special voting rights whereby the holder(s) may exercise their right to vote on all shareholder matters representing the number of votes equal to all shares of common stock then issued and outstanding, plus an additional ten thousand (10,000) shares. Additionally, the board of directors voted to extend an existing 12 month consulting contract with the Company s CEO, Murray Fleming, for an additional 12 months, through October 1, 2016, without further compensation, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Fleming, of the 1,000 Series A Special Preferred Shares. A Certificate of Designation for the Series A Special Preferred Shares was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and effective on December 1, 2014.        Our Business       From inception through September 25, 2011, we were a manufacturer of a pre-mix anti-oxidant for chicken integrators containing wheat middlings, vitamin E, calcium carbonate, silicone dioxyde, shrimp flour, sodium selenite and fish oil. We were also a distributor of a biological larvicide produced from a strain of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti). We were not successful in these business endeavors.     On September 26, 2011, we acquired the  Type2 Defense  product together with all intellectual property associated therewith. Upon the acquisition of Type2 Defense, we discontinued our former operations and wrote off all inventories attributable to our former operations. Type2 Defense is a dietary supplement made from natural ingredients formulated to support healthy glucose levels and targeted to consumers concerned about Type-2 and pre-diabetes.     The first production run of the Company s Type2 Defense product was completed in June 2013. On July 8, 2013, the Company announced the product was available for on-line sales on Amazon.com. On July 9, 2013, the Company announced the product was available for on-line sales via the www.Type2Defense.com website. Subsequently, the Company encountered significant management, operational and financial challenges resulting in poor product sales and inadequate inventory control. As a consequence, the Company generated only nominal revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and the Company elected to declare the $200,000 intellectual property for Type2 Defense, recorded as other intangible assets, as impaired at December 31, 2013.      On April 8, 2014, the Company appointed James Hodge chairman of the Company s board of directors.     On April 8, 2014, in a special meeting of the board of directors, the board voted in favor of amending the Company s bylaws to decrease the number of members of the board of directors from three to one. The previous board members agreed to resign from the board and accept other duties for the Company.     On April 21, 2014, the Company appointed Thomas Metzger Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Peggy Knight was appointed Chief Marketing Officer.     On July 22, 2014, Thomas Metzger Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, resigned from the Company. James Hodge, chairman of the board of directors was appointed interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.                  8       
      Table of Contents            Our Current Business       On October 1, 2014, Murray Fleming was appointed the Company s Chief Executive Officer for the 12-month period ending October 1, 2015. Additionally, on October 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement to purchase the  Glucose Health Natural Blood Sugar Maintenance  product from a company of which Mr. Fleming is the beneficial owner.      Following this purchase, the Company undertook a series of steps to achieve a final product offering that would be considered efficacious as well as pleasant tasting by our target consumer market, being persons concerned with pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes, and would offer a value proposition relative to our competition in order to be considered for stocking by national and regional pharmacy retailers. To assist in achieving our final product objectives, we retained a former head of beverage product development at Nestle. We retained an attorney specializing in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations pertaining to dietary supplements and Federal Trade Commission (FDC) regulations, necessary, in part, to enable our product to be stocked by national pharmacy retailers. We also undertook a number of actions to establish and build our Glucose Health    brand. The Company conducted a design competition related to its packaging artwork and product logo and retained an experienced product packaging graphic artist to assist with all digital and print representations of the product. The Company filed for and received trademark protection for Glucose Health    with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USPTO). While our primary sales and marketing focus is achieving sales to consumers through national and regional pharmacies, secondarily, we intend to also market the product directly to customers via our dedicated product website and through other online marketplaces.      Glucose Health    is a dietary supplement formulated from nine natural ingredients shown in certain clinical research such as that published on the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine website (see www.glucosehealth.com/clinical-trials), to have a beneficial impact upon blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes a National Diabetes Statistics Report annually. The 2014 Report estimates 2 of 5 presently healthy Americans will develop Type-2 diabetes in their lifetime. We believe the CDC Report and other similar research points to a large and growing market of consumers likely concerned with pre-diabetes or Type-2 diabetes including many of whom are also likely seeking natural products like Glucose Health    in order to proactively maintain their good health.     On November 20, 2014, the existing 12 month consulting contract with the Company s CEO, Murray Fleming, was extended an additional 12 months ending October 2016, without further compensation, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Fleming, of 1,000 Series A Special Preferred Shares.     On December 31, 2014, the Company elected to write-off its inventory of Type2 Defense product to -0- and cease manufacturing and sales activities related to the product.     On January 5, 2015, the Company signed a contract manufacturing agreement for testing, compounding, supply and order fulfillment for the Glucose Health    product and additionally a purchasing agreement to distribute the product through a limited number of Northwest Arkansas pharmacies.      On January 7, 2015, the Company completed its implementation of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 111 of the FDA's regulations requires companies which manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement to establish and follow current good manufacturing practice to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record.     On January 26, 2015, the Company filed an initial application for trademark protection with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USPTO).      On January 29, 2015, the Company appointed Chandrasekhar Mallangi, Ph.D., as an advisor. Dr. Mallangi earned a Ph.D. in Food Science from Oregon State University and is an advisor to multinational companies in the development of nutritional products. Dr. Mallangi is the credited inventor and co-inventor for patents in the area of food nutrition, awarded by the USPTO to subsidiaries of Nestle, SA of Vevey, Switzerland.                  9       
      Table of Contents          On February 10, 2015, Murray Fleming, the Company s Chief Executive Officer was appointed the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Fleming replaced James Hodge the Company s interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Hodge continued as the Company s Chairman of the Board of Directors.     On February 24, 2015, the Company completed FDA facility registration, a compliance procedure for manufacturers of dietary supplements.     On May 26, 2015, the Company completed the first production run of the product and pursuant to the January 5, 2015 purchasing agreement, the product began to be offered for retail sale through a limited number of Northwest Arkansas pharmacies as well as on the Company s product website www.glucosehealth.com.     On July 7, 2015, the Company received notification from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that its application for trademark of  Glucose Health  was accepted to the Supplemental Register (Reg. 4,770,720) with first use recognized by the USPTO as of February 1, 2015.     On January 6, 2016, the Company executed a General Merchandise Supplier Agreement ("Agreement") with Wal-mart Stores, Inc.      On January 27, 2016 the Company notified OTC Markets, Inc. of its intention to not renew its OTCQB service. The Company filed Form 8-A12G in fiscal 2015 registering a class of securities under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Company does not make use of the OTC Markets Disclosure and News Service and instead files its periodic and annual reports and audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     On February 4, 2016, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Murray Fleming, was appointed to the Board of Directors of Glucose Health, Inc. ("Company"). On February 5, 2016, James Hodge resigned from the Board of Directors.      On March 8, 2016, the Company received a series of material purchase orders from the Customer pursuant to a General Merchandise Supplier Agreement ("Agreement") with Wal-mart Stores, Inc., executed January 6, 2016.      At September 30, 2016, the Company s Glucose Health    Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance Blueberry Tea Mix (60-Day Supply) product is stocked in the "Diabetic Supplies" section of many Walmart pharmacies in all 50 states.       Going Concern       These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues since inception and has generated losses totaling $6,123,557 since inception and needs to continue to raise additional capital to carry out its business plan. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain necessary operating capital to continue operations of which there is no assurance. The Company has little operating history to date. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These factors an others raise substantial doubt regarding the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.     The Company estimates it will need a total of $30,000 in capital to continue its operations through the end of 2016. Besides generating revenues from current operations, the Company may need to raise additional capital to expand operations in order to achieve profitability. Such capital may not be raised on terms favorable to the Company, if at all. If adequate capital cannot be raised outside of the Company, the Company s officer and director may need to provide capital to sustain operations. There is no assurance the Company s officer and director will provide such capital on terms favorable to the Company, or at all.                     NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES            Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company provides estimates for its common stock valuations, inventory reserves, and valuation allowances for deferred taxes.       Comprehensive Income (Loss)       The Company adopted ASC 220-10,  Reporting Comprehensive Income.  ASC 220-10 requires the reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from operations.     Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income.       Cash Flow Reporting        The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method ( Indirect method ) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     The Company maintains its cash balances at one financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.       Accounts Receivable       Accounts receivable consist of billed and uncollected sales of products. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to allow for any amounts that may not be recoverable, which is based on an analysis of the Company s prior collection experience, customer credit worthiness, and current economic trends. Based on management s review of accounts receivable, no allowance for doubtful accounts is considered necessary at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The Company does not charge significant amounts of interest on past due receivables.       Prepaid Expenses       The Company considers all items incurred for future service to be prepaid expenses. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had prepaid expenses of $1,613 and $1,282, respectively, comprised of the issuance of unregistered shares of the Company s common stock to consultants.       Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets       The Company reviews its long-lived assets on a periodic basis, namely intellectual property, whenever events and changes in circumstances have occurred which may indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for potential impairment will be based primarily on the Company s ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future cash flows from its operations on an undiscounted basis. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fixed assets to be disposed of by sale will be carried at the lower of the then current carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.             The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies  data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities, is the implied fair value of goodwill.      The Company makes critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in impairment that is not material to our results of operations.     We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant.      During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded no impairment charges related to other intangible assets.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The carrying amount reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term notes approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments.     ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:             Level 1    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities      Level 2    Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.      Level 3    Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.                Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.       Beneficial Conversion Features       ASC 470-20 applies to convertible securities with beneficial conversion features that must be settled in stock and to those that give the issuer a choice in settling the obligation in either stock or cash. ASC 470-20 requires that the beneficial conversion feature should be valued at the commitment date as the difference between the conversion price and the fair market value of the common stock into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible. This amount is recorded as a debt discount and amortized over the life of the debt. ASC 470-20 further limits this amount to the proceeds allocated to the convertible instrument.       Income Taxes       The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability method of accounting. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates in effect in years in which differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are expected to be realized.     The Company follows ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  ( ASC 740-10 ). This interpretation requires recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a  more-likely-than-not  approach. ASC 740-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Management has adopted ASC 740-10 for 2007, and they evaluate their tax positions on an annual basis, and have determined that as of September 30, 2016, no additional accrual for income taxes is necessary. The Company s policy is to recognize both interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits expected to result in payment of cash within one year are classified as accrued liabilities, while those expected beyond one year are classified as other liabilities. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties since its inception. The Company is required to file income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and in various state tax jurisdictions. The tax years for 2010 to 2015 remain open for examination by federal and/or state tax jurisdictions. The Company is currently not under examination by any other tax jurisdictions for any tax year.       Revenue Recognition       The Company utilizes the following criteria with respect to the recognition of revenue:               1)    Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;                   2)    delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;                   3)    the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and                   4)    collectability is reasonably assured.           Share Based Compensation       The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 718 and No. 505. The Company issues restricted stock to employees for their services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the date of grant. These shares are considered fully vested and the fair market value is recognized as expense in the period granted. The Company also issues restricted stock to consultants for various services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment only if there is sufficient disincentive to ensure performance or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete. The Company recognized consulting expenses and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services. For agreements requiring future services, the consulting expense is to be recognized ratably over the requisite service period.              (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock       Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) include additional dilution from common stock equivalents, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options, warrants and convertible notes. Common stock equivalents are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share when the Company reports a loss because to do so would be anti-dilutive for periods presented. Except as noted below, the Company has not issued any options or warrants to date. At September 30, 2016, 38,024,563 unregistered shares of the Company s common stock are issuable upon conversion of all outstanding balances of convertible notes payable if such balances are not repaid in cash.        Inventory       Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (FIFO: first-in, first-out) or market, and includes raw materials and finished goods. The cost of finished goods includes the cost of packaging supplies, direct and indirect labor and other indirect manufacturing costs. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had inventory of $6,418 comprised of the Glucose Health    Natural Blood Sugar Maintenance Blueberry Tea Mix (45 Servings) product and no inventory of Glucose Health    Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance Blueberry Tea Mix (60 Servings). All Glucose Health    products are affixed with a production lot number and  Best Before  date of 24 months following production. The Company currently sees no trends that would render its current inventory obsolete prior to its  Best Before  date.       Recent Issued Accounting Standards       There were updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates .     Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates.     Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.     The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 together with notes thereto as previously filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K on April 14, 2016. In addition, these accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     The Company maintains cash balances at one financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.       Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets       The Company reviews their long-lived assets on a periodic basis, namely intellectual property, whenever events and changes in circumstances have occurred which may indicate a possible impairment. The assessment for potential impairment will be based primarily on the Company s ability to recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets from expected future cash flows from its operations on an undiscounted basis. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fixed assets to be disposed of by sale will be carried at the lower of the then current carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.             The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies  data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities, is the implied fair value of goodwill.     We make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, inflation and discount rates. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the reporting units tested would result in impairment that is not material to our results of operations. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the discount rate used would also result in impairment that is not material to our results of operations.      We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The carrying amount reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term notes payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments.       Beneficial Conversion Features       ASC 470-20 applies to convertible securities with beneficial conversion features that must be settled in stock and to those that give the issuer a choice in settling the obligation in either stock or cash. ASC 470-20 requires that the beneficial conversion feature should be valued at the commitment date as the difference between the conversion price and the fair market value of the common stock into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the security is convertible. This amount is recorded as a debt discount and amortized over the life of the debt. ASC 470-20 further limits this amount to the proceeds allocated to the convertible instrument.       Revenue Recognition       The Company utilizes the following criteria with respect to the recognition of revenue:                 1)  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;                         2)  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;                         3)  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and                         4)  collectability is reasonably assured.             Share Based Compensation       The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 718 and No. 505. For employees, directors and non-employees, the fair value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. The Company has not issued any stock options or warrants.              Inventory       Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (FIFO: first-in, first-out) or market, and includes raw materials and finished goods.

Our principal executive office is located at 609 SW 8th Street, Suite 600, Bentonville, AR 72712 and our telephone number is 479-802-3827. Our corporate website is www.glucosehealthinc.com and our product website is www.glucosehealth.com. Our CUSIP number is 379894108 and trading symbol is GLUC. We are a manufacturer of dietary supplement products and our business focus is serving the consumer market segment of persons concerned with pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes. As discussed in greater detail below, our principal product is Glucose Health    Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance. We acquired this product in fourth quarter of 2014 and we are in the early stages of manufacturing, marketing and distributing this product. We have a history of losses.        Corporate Information        We were incorporated under the laws of State of Nevada on March 27, 2007, as Bio-Solutions Corp.      On October 17, 2012, our Board of Directors and shareholders holding a majority of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to written consents in lieu of a meeting, approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital (the  amendment ). The amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 17, 2012, increasing our authorized capital from 90,000,000 shares of common stock, to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001.     On January 10, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors unanimously voted to reverse split the Company s common stock on the basis of one share of the Company s common stock for each 10 shares outstanding while maintaining the authorized capital structure of the Company at 200,000,000 shares. The Board resolution set the date of record for shareholder approval for January 14, 2014. As of January 29, 2014, the Company obtained written consent in lieu of a meeting of the shareholders to authorize a reverse split of the Company s common stock. Shareholders owning a total of 100,992,469 shares of the Company s common stock voted in favor of the reverse split. There were a total of 199,611,900 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of January 14, 2014 (the date of record). The number of shares of common stock voting in favor of the reverse split was sufficient for approval. On February 4, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada effecting a 1-for-10 reverse split pursuant to which every ten shares of the Company s common stock were combined and converted into one share of the Company s common stock (with all fractional shares resulting there from being rounded up to the next whole share) with the total number of shares of the Company s authorized common stock remaining at 200,000,000 shares. The effective date of the above corporate action was February 26, 2014.             On October 30, 2014, the board of directors of the Company voted to reverse split the Company s common stock on the basis of one share of the Company s common stock for each 50 shares outstanding while maintaining the authorized capital structure of the Company at 200,000,000 shares; to authorize 1,000 shares of preferred stock with  blank check  rights; and to change the Company s name from Bio-Solutions Corp. to Glucose Health, Inc. (the  corporate action ). The board resolution set the date of record for shareholder approval of the corporate action for October 31, 2014 and the effective date of the corporate action for November 19, 2014. As of October 31, 2014, the Company obtained written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders to authorize the corporate action. Shareholders owning a total of 30,596,154 shares of the Company s common stock voted in favor of the corporate action. There were a total of 60,132,271 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2014 (the date of record). The number of shares of common stock voting in favor of the corporate action was sufficient for approval. On November 5, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting, as of November 19, 2014, the 1-for-50 reverse split pursuant to which every fifty shares of the Company s common stock were combined and converted into one share of the Company s common stock (with all fractional shares being rounded up to the next whole share) with the total number of shares of the Company s authorized common stock remaining at 200,000,000 shares; effecting the authorization of 1,000 shares of preferred stock with  blank check  rights; and effecting the change of the Company s name from Bio-Solutions Corp. to Glucose Health, Inc. On November 20, 2015, the board of directors voted to designate Series A Special Preferred Shares consisting of 1,000 shares of preferred stock with special voting rights whereby the holder(s) may exercise their right to vote on all shareholder matters representing the number of votes equal to all shares of common stock then issued and outstanding, plus an additional ten thousand (10,000) shares. Additionally, the board of directors voted to extend an existing 12 month consulting contract with the Company s CEO, Murray Fleming, for an additional 12 months, through October 1, 2016, without further compensation, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Fleming, of the 1,000 Series A Special Preferred Shares. A Certificate of Designation for the Series A Special Preferred Shares was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State and effective on December 1, 2014.        Our Business       From inception through September 25, 2011, we were a manufacturer of a pre-mix anti-oxidant for chicken integrators containing wheat middlings, vitamin E, calcium carbonate, silicone dioxyde, shrimp flour, sodium selenite and fish oil. We were also a distributor of a biological larvicide produced from a strain of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti). We were not successful in these business endeavors.     On September 26, 2011, we acquired the  Type2 Defense  product together with all intellectual property associated therewith. Upon the acquisition of Type2 Defense, we discontinued our former operations and wrote off all inventories attributable to our former operations. Type2 Defense is a dietary supplement made from natural ingredients formulated to support healthy glucose levels and targeted to consumers concerned about Type-2 and pre-diabetes.     The first production run of the Company s Type2 Defense product was completed in June 2013. On July 8, 2013, the Company announced the product was available for on-line sales on Amazon.com. On July 9, 2013, the Company announced the product was available for on-line sales via the www.Type2Defense.com website. Subsequently, the Company encountered significant management, operational and financial challenges resulting in poor product sales and inadequate inventory control. As a consequence, the Company generated only nominal revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and the Company elected to declare the $200,000 intellectual property for Type2 Defense, recorded as other intangible assets, as impaired at December 31, 2013.      On April 8, 2014, the Company appointed James Hodge chairman of the Company s board of directors.     On April 8, 2014, in a special meeting of the board of directors, the board voted in favor of amending the Company s bylaws to decrease the number of members of the board of directors from three to one. The previous board members agreed to resign from the board and accept other duties for the Company.     On April 21, 2014, the Company appointed Thomas Metzger Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Peggy Knight was appointed Chief Marketing Officer.     On July 22, 2014, Thomas Metzger Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, resigned from the Company. James Hodge, chairman of the board of directors was appointed interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.              Our Current Business       On October 1, 2014, Murray Fleming was appointed the Company s Chief Executive Officer for the 12-month period ending October 1, 2015. Additionally, on October 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement to purchase the  Glucose Health Natural Blood Sugar Maintenance  product from a company of which Mr. Fleming is the beneficial owner.      Following this purchase, the Company undertook a series of steps to achieve a final product offering that would be considered efficacious as well as pleasant tasting by our target consumer market, being persons concerned with pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes, and would offer a value proposition relative to our competition in order to be considered for stocking by national and regional pharmacy retailers. To assist in achieving our final product objectives, we retained a former head of beverage product development at Nestle. We retained an attorney specializing in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations pertaining to dietary supplements and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations, necessary, in part, to allow our product to be stocked by national pharmacy retailers. We also undertook a number of actions to establish and build our Glucose Health    brand. The Company conducted a design competition related to its packaging artwork and product logo and retained an experienced product packaging graphic artist to assist with all digital and print representations of the product. The Company filed for and received trademark protection for Glucose Health    with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USPTO). While our primary sales and marketing focus is achieving sales to consumers through national and regional pharmacies, secondarily, we intend to also market the product directly to customers via our dedicated product website and through other online marketplaces.      Glucose Health    is a dietary supplement formulated from nine natural ingredients shown in certain clinical research such as that published on the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine website (see www.glucosehealth.com/clinical-trials), to have a beneficial impact upon blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes a National Diabetes Statistics Report annually. The 2014 Report estimates 2 of 5 presently healthy Americans will develop Type-2 diabetes in their lifetime. We believe the CDC Report and other similar research points to a large and growing market of consumers likely concerned with pre-diabetes or Type-2 diabetes including many of whom are likely seeking natural products like Glucose Health    in order to proactively maintain their good health.     On November 20, 2014, the existing 12 month consulting contract with the Company s CEO, Murray Fleming, was extended an additional 12 months ending October 2016, without further compensation, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Fleming, of 1,000 Series A Special Preferred Shares.     On December 31, 2014, the Company elected to write-off its inventory of Type2 Defense product to -0- and cease manufacturing and sales activities related to the product.     On January 5, 2015, the Company signed a contract manufacturing agreement for testing, compounding, supply and order fulfillment for the Glucose Health    product and additionally a purchasing agreement to distribute the product through a limited number of Northwest Arkansas pharmacies.      On January 7, 2015, the Company completed its implementation of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 111 of the FDA's regulations requires companies which manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement to establish and follow current good manufacturing practice to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record.     On January 26, 2015, the Company filed an initial application for trademark protection with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USPTO).      On January 29, 2015, the Company appointed Chandrasekhar Mallangi, Ph.D., as an advisor. Dr. Mallangi earned a Ph.D. in Food Science from Oregon State University and is an advisor to multinational companies in the development of nutritional products. Dr. Mallangi is the credited inventor and co-inventor for patents in the area of food nutrition, awarded by the USPTO to subsidiaries of Nestle, SA of Vevey, Switzerland.            On February 10, 2015, Murray Fleming, the Company s Chief Executive Officer was appointed the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Fleming replaced James Hodge the Company s interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Hodge continued as the Company s Chairman of the Board of Directors.     On February 24, 2015, the Company completed FDA facility registration, a compliance procedure for manufacturers of dietary supplements.     On May 26, 2015, the Company completed the first production run of the product and pursuant to the January 5, 2015 purchasing agreement, the product began to be offered for retail sale through a limited number of Northwest Arkansas pharmacies as well as on the Company s product website www.glucosehealth.com.     On July 7, 2015, the Company received notification from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that its application for trademark of  Glucose Health  was accepted to the Supplemental Register (Reg. 4,770,720) with first use recognized by the USPTO as of February 1, 2015.     On January 6, 2016, the Company executed a General Merchandise Supplier Agreement ("Agreement") with Wal-mart Stores, Inc.      On January 27, 2016 the Company notified OTC Markets, Inc. of its intention to not renew its OTCQB service. The Company filed Form 8-A12G in fiscal 2015 registering a class of securities under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Company does not make use of the OTC Markets Disclosure and News Service and instead files its periodic and annual reports and audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     On February 4, 2016, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Murray Fleming, was appointed to the Board of Directors of Glucose Health, Inc. ("Company"). On February 5, 2016, James Hodge resigned from the Board of Directors.      On March 8, 2016, the Company received a series of material purchase orders pursuant to a General Merchandise Supplier Agreement ("Agreement") with Wal-mart Stores, Inc., executed January 6, 2016.      At September 30, 2016, the Company s Glucose Health    Daily Blood Sugar Maintenance Blueberry Tea Mix (60-Day Supply) product is stocked in the "Diabetic Supplies" section of many Walmart pharmacies in all 50 states.      Results of Operations       For the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015       Revenues      We generated $2,110 in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,055 revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s focus for the remainder of 2016 will be to increase revenues from the sales of our Glucose Health    products.      Operating Expenses      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had total operating expenses of $52,932, as compared to total operating expenses of $34,272 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $18,660 or 54%, in operating expenses between the periods is primarily due to the increase in professional fees.             Net Loss      For the three months ended September 30, 2016, after interest expense of $105,263, we had a net loss of $160,819 or $0.06 per share. In comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, after interest expense of $15,086, we had a net loss of $49,253 or $0.02 per share. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015       Revenues      We generated $298,039 in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,632 of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s focus for the remainder of 2016 will be to increase revenues from the sale of our Glucose Health    products.      Operating Expenses      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had total operating expenses of $80,580, as compared to total operating expenses of $141,602 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $61,022 in operating expenses between the periods is primarily due to the Company renegotiating and/or terminating consulting and administrative contracts. We expect to continue to incur significant legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company.      Net Loss      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, after interest expense of $224,564, we had a net loss of $286,363 or $0.11 per share. In comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, after interest expense of $98,579, we had a net loss of $219,266 or $0.12 per share. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      As of September 30, 2016, our current assets totaled $43,662 consisting primarily of $23,639 of cash, $11,742 of accounts receivable and $6,418 of inventory.     Our current liabilities were $417,594 as of September 30, 2016, which consisting primarily of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $157,185, short-term loans of $40,000 and convertible notes payable of $220,409.     We had no other liabilities and no long-term commitments or contingencies as of September 30, 2016.     During the period from August 4, 2014 through and including April 1, 2016, the Company issued 18 separate convertible notes of various principal amounts and fixed conversion prices to a corporation owned by the Company s CEO. For the purpose of administrative simplification and with no benefit or inducement given, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with the corporation owned by the Company s CEO and issued a single convertible note with a consolidated principal amount of $112,157 and pro-rata fixed conversion price of $0.011.      During the period from August 2, 2013 through and including April 1, 2016, the Company issued 20 separate convertible promissory notes of various principal amounts and fixed conversion prices to a corporation. For the purpose of administrative simplification and with no benefit or inducement given, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with the corporation and issued a single convertible note with a consolidated principal amount of $169,065 and pro-rata fixed conversion price of $0.008.             On March 11, 2016, the Company issued a $35,000 note to a corporation owned by the Company's CEO. The loan bears interest at 24% per annum and has a maturity date of July 11, 2016. On July 29, 2016, the loan was repaid in full.     On May 1, 2016, the Company issued a $35,000 note to a corporation owned by the Company s CEO. The loan bears interest at 24% per annum and has a maturity date of September 1, 2016.      On May 18, 2016, the Company issued a $30,000 note to a corporation. The loan bears interest at 24% per annum and has a maturity date of July 18, 2016. On July 21, 2016, the loan was repaid in full.     On September 15, 2016, the Company issued a $5,000 note to a corporation. The loan bears interest at 12% per annum and is payable on demand.       Our Plan of Operation for the Next Twelve Months.      Our principal business strategy for the next twelve months will be to implement sales and marketing initiatives to earn significant revenues from our Glucose Health    dietary supplement products. Our sales initiatives will be focused upon securing repeat purchase orders from national and/or regional pharmacy retailers. Our marketing initiatives will be primarily focused on supporting the sale of our Glucose Health    products through our national and/or regional retail partners. We intend to begin advertising our Glucose Health    products via targeted television, radio, print, digital and social media platforms, which reach our consumer market segment. Secondarily, we intend to grow our online sales of Glucose Health    products by enhancing our product website www.glucosehealth.com and by pursue sales through other online marketplaces. We also intend to continue to develop our Glucose Health    products and brand in three ways: by improving our proprietary formula with respect to taste and efficacy; by introducing new flavors; and by introducing additional packaging formats.     At September 30, 2016, we had nominal cash, which will not be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty our anticipated revenues or cash flow. Our forecasts and operations will involve risks and uncertainties, which we are unable to predict and actual results could fail. We will require additional capital to continue operations. If we cannot secure additional capital or generate significant revenues, we may cease operations in which case you will lose your investment.     We intend to continue to source capital from the two private companies currently providing financing to us on a monthly basis. We cannot guarantee that such additional funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then our ability to continue or expand our operations may be significantly hindered. If adequate funds are not available, our officer, directors and principal shareholders may contribute capital to the Company in the form of debt or equity financing. However, our officer, directors and principal shareholders are not committed to contribute capital to pay for our expenses.     Even assuming that we secure adequate financing, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable at any time in the future. Further, the legal and accounting costs of being a public company will continue to impact our liquidity and we will need to obtain funds to pay these expenses. Other than the anticipated increases in legal and accounting costs due to the reporting requirements of being a reporting company, we are not aware of any other known trends, events or uncertainties, which may affect our future liquidity.     Our auditors have questioned our ability to continue operations as a  going concern.  While we expect to obtain significant revenues from future product sales, in the absence of significant sales and profits, we will seek to raise funds to meet our working capital needs principally through the additional sales of our securities. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such funds, even if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us. As a result, our auditors believe that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue operations.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.              Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk       Not applicable       Item 4. Controls and Procedures       Our management team, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer/principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of the last day of the fiscal period covered by this report, September 30, 2016. Based upon this review, these officers concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     The controls designed were adequate for financial disclosures required for the preparation of the 10-Q filing; however due to lack of resources in the company s accounting department the controls were not operating effectively. The remediation plan for improving the effectiveness over financial disclosure controls, which caused the material weakness over financial disclosures required in the 10-Q, include the creation of a financial disclosures roll-forward model in accordance with the disclosures contained in the 10-Q report. This model will be maintained and updated by Company management, as new business transactions require additional financial disclosures. As the Company obtains additional resources these financial disclosures will be reviewed by an outside financial disclosure expert for completeness and accuracy earlier in the financial statement closing process cycle in order to help ensure completeness and accuracy for reporting financial disclosures.     It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Holders of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling those shares because our common stock will probably be subject to the penny stock rules.      Purchases of Equity Securities.      The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the period ending September 30, 2016.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities       None       Item 4.
