1.    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of IDEX Corporation ( IDEX,   we,   our,  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) applicable to interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The statements are unaudited but include all adjustments, consisting only of recurring items, except as noted, that the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information set forth herein. The results of operations for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in this report should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The Company applied this standard prospectively and thus, prior periods have not been adjusted. 
    The impact of the adoption resulted in the following: 
             
    The Company recorded a tax benefit of   $1.2 million   and   $5.4 million   within Provision for income taxes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to the excess tax benefit on stock options, restricted stock and performance share units. Prior to adoption this amount would have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. This change could create volatility in the Company s effective tax rate. 
                
    The Company elected not to change our policy on accounting for forfeitures and continued to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered.   
                
    The Company no longer reclassifies the excess tax benefit from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows.  
                
    The Company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . This increased our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by   198 thousand   and   174 thousand   shares for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.   
     Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which introduces a new lessee model that will require most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet and eliminates the required use of bright line tests in current U.S. GAAP for determining lease classification. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

  (unaudited) 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which introduces a new five-step 
  revenue recognition model. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption. The FASB has also issued the following standards which clarify ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard: ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ; ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ; and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2018. 

2.    Acquisitions and Divestitures  
  All of the Company s acquisitions have been accounted for under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,   Business Combinations  . Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after adjustments to reflect fair values assigned to assets and liabilities, have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. 
  The Company incurred   $1.6 million   and   $0.9 million   of acquisition-related transaction costs in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.0 million   and   $2.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and were related to completed transactions, pending transactions and potential transactions, including transactions that ultimately were not completed. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $4.6 million   and   $10.4 million  , respectively, of fair value inventory step-up charges in Cost of sales associated with the completed 2016 acquisitions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded within Cost of sales   $2.7 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively, of fair value inventory charges associated with completed 2015 acquisitions.

facilities. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized as part of the transaction were   $132.4 million   and   $114.7 million  , respectively. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  The Company made initial allocations of the purchase price for the Akron Brass, AWG Fittings and SFC Koenig acquisitions as of the acquisition date based on its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As the Company obtains additional information about these assets and liabilities and learns more about the newly acquired businesses, we will refine the estimates of fair value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. Only items identified as of the acquisition date are considered for subsequent adjustment. The Company will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period, as required. 
  The preliminary allocation of the acquisition costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values, are as follows: 

Acquired intangible assets consist of trade names, customer relationships and unpatented technology. The goodwill recorded for the acquisitions reflect the strategic fit, revenue and earnings growth potential of these businesses. 
  Of the   $215.4 million   of acquired intangible assets,   $28.8 million   was assigned to the Akron Brass trade name and is not subject to amortization. The acquired intangible assets and weighted average amortization periods are as follows:

CPS was acquired for an aggregate purchase price of   $24.2 million  , consisting of   $19.5 million   in cash and contingent consideration valued at   $4.7 million   as of the opening balance sheet date. The contingent consideration was based on the achievement of financial objectives during the 12-month period following the close. Based on potential outcomes, the undiscounted amount of all the future payments that the Company could have been required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement was between   $0   and   $5.5 million  . During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company re-evaluated the contingent consideration arrangement and fully reversed the   $4.7 million   liability based on CPS s actual operating results from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016.

4.    Earnings Per Common Share 
  Earnings per common share ( EPS ) are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents outstanding (diluted) during the period. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options, which have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, restricted stock, performance share units, and shares issuable in connection with certain deferred compensation agreements ( DCUs ). 
  ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share,   provides that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. If awards are considered participating securities, the Company is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its outstanding shares of restricted stock are participating securities. Accordingly, earnings per common share are computed using the more dilutive of the treasury stock method and the two-class method prescribed by ASC 260.  
  Basic weighted average shares reconciles to diluted weighted average shares as follows: 

Options to purchase approximately   0.1 million   and   0.9 million   shares of common stock for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   0.9 million   and   0.5 million   shares of common stock for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. 

5.    Inventories 
  The components of inventories as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were: 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost, which includes material, labor and factory overhead, is determined on a FIFO basis.

6.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , by reportable business segment, were as follows: 

ASC 350,   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,   requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Annually, on October 31, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment.  Based on the results of our annual impairment test at October 31,   2015  , all reporting units had a fair value that was more than   70%   greater than the carrying value, except for our IDEX Optics and Photonics ( IOP ) and Valves reporting units. Our IOP reporting unit had a fair value that was approximately   20%   in excess of the carrying value and our Valves reporting unit had a fair value near its carrying value as a result of the formation of this reporting unit in conjunction with our Alfa acquisition in June 2015. Due to the divestitures in the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed interim impairment tests at the Water and IOP reporting units. As a result of these interim impairment tests, the Company concluded that both reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values.  The Water reporting unit had a fair value that was significantly in excess of its carrying value and the IOP reporting unit had a fair value that was approximately   20%   in excess of its carrying value, both of which are consistent with our annual impairment test at October 31, 2015. 
    
         The following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Banjo trade name is an indefinite lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  In the first   nine

months of   2016  , there were no triggering events or changes that would have required a review. Based on the results of our annual impairment test at October 31,   2015  , the fair value of the Banjo trade name was greater than   20%   in excess of the carrying value. 
  The Akron Brass trade name is an indefinite lived intangible asset that was generated as a result of the Akron Brass acquisition in March 2016 and it will be tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.   
  Amortization of intangible assets was   $12.8 million   and   $11.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Amortization of intangible assets was   $28.4 million   and   $26.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Based on the intangible asset balances as of   September 30, 2016  , amortization expense is expected to approximate   $14.0 million   for the remaining   three   months of   2016  ,   $40.3 million   in   2017  ,   $34.5 million   in   2018  ,   $33.0 million   in   2019   and   $32.2 million   in   2020  .

9.    Borrowings 
  Borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

On June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of   $100 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.20%   Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 and   $100 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.37%   Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (collectively, the  Notes ) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the  Purchase Agreement ). Each series of Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13   th    and December 13   th   . The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the Notes; provided that such portion is greater than   5%   of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase Notes by making an offer to all holders of the Notes, subject to certain conditions. 
  The Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, incur indebtedness, create liens, transact with affiliates and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or other change of control transactions. In addition, the Company must comply with a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, as further described below, and the Purchase Agreement also limits the outstanding principal amount of priority debt that may be incurred by the Company to   15%   of consolidated assets. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment event of default, any holder of the Notes affected thereby may declare all the Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of Notes may declare all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately. 
  On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) along with certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the  Borrowers ), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, with other agents party thereto. The Credit Agreement replaces the Company s existing   five  -year,   $700 million   credit agreement, dated as of June 27, 2011, which was due to expire on June 27, 2016. 
  The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Facility ) in an aggregate principal amount of   $700 million  , with a final maturity date of   June 23, 2020  . The maturity date may be extended under certain conditions for an additional   one  -year term. Up to   $75 million   of the Revolving Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to   $50 million   of the Revolving Facility is available to the Company for swing line loans, available on a same-day basis. 
  Proceeds of the Revolving Facility are available for use by the Borrowers for acquisitions, working capital and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed   $350 million  . The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, 
  the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the Company s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from   .005%   to   1.50%  . Based on the Company s credit rating at   September 30, 2016  , the applicable margin was   1.10%  , resulting in a weighted average interest rate of   1.34%   at   September 30, 2016  . Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. 
  The Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon (a) the amount of the lenders  commitments under the credit facility from time to time and (b) the applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the credit facility are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements. 
  The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations (each of which is subject to customary exceptions for 
  financings of this type) on our ability to grant liens; enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company); restrict subsidiary dividends or other subsidiary distributions; enter into transactions with the Company s affiliates; and incur certain additional subsidiary debt. 
  The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate) including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the representations or warranties in any material respect; breach of the financial, affirmative or negative covenants; payment default on, or acceleration of, other material indebtedness; bankruptcy or insolvency; material judgments entered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries; certain specified events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain changes in control of the Company; and the invalidity or unenforceability of the Credit Agreement or other documents associated with the Credit Agreement. 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $255.1 million   was outstanding under the Revolving Facility, with   $8.2 million   of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at   September 30, 2016   of approximately   $436.7 million  .  
  Other borrowings of   $1.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of debt at international locations maintained for working capital purposes. Interest is payable on the outstanding debt balances at rates ranging from   0.9%   to   2.8%   per annum. 
  There are   two   key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the Notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of   3.0   to   1   and a maximum leverage ratio of   3.50   to   1  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants. There are no financial covenants relating to the   4.5%   Senior Notes or   4.2%   Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions. 

10.    Derivative Instruments 
  The Company enters into cash flow hedges from time to time to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The type of cash flow hedges the Company enters into includes foreign currency contracts and interest rate exchange agreements that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and are designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. 
  The effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate exchange agreements is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects net income. See Note 13 for the amount of loss reclassified into income for interest rate contracts for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is recognized into net income during the period of change. 
    
  Fair values relating to derivative financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to sell or buy the contracts based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts at each balance sheet date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any interest rate contracts outstanding. 
  In 2010 and 2011, the Company entered into   two   separate forward starting interest rate contracts in anticipation of the issuance of the   4.2%   Senior Notes and the   4.5%   Senior Notes. The Company cash settled these two interest rate contracts in 2010 and 2011 for a total of   $68.9 million  , which is being amortized into interest expense over the   10   year term of the debt instruments. Approximately   $6.7 million   of the pre-tax amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders

equity at   September 30, 2016   will be recognized to net income over the next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions are realized. 

11.    Fair Value Measurements 
  ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 
             
    Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions. 
     The following table summarizes the basis used to measure the Company s financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  In determining the fair value of the contingent consideration potentially due on the acquisition of CPS, the Company used probability weighted estimates of EBITDA during the earn-out period. The   $4.7 million   represented management s best estimate of the liability as of the opening balance sheet date and December 31, 2015, based on a range of outcomes of CPS s 12 month operating results, from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company re-evaluated the contingent consideration arrangement and fully reversed the   $4.7 million   liability based on CPS s actual operating results from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The   $4.7 million   reversal was recognized as a benefit within Selling, general and administrative expenses, of which   $3.7 million   was recognized in March 2016 and the remaining   $1.0 million   was recognized in June 2016.  
  The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Facility,   3.2%   Senior Notes,   3.37%   Senior Notes,   4.5%   Senior Notes and   4.2%   Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices and current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity, was approximately   $1,143.2 million   compared to the carrying value of   $1,103.9 million  . This fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since it is determined based upon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions to entities with a credit rating similar to ours.

12.    Restructuring 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded restructuring costs as part of the 2015 restructuring initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, primarily consisting of employee reductions. The costs incurred related to these initiatives were included in Restructuring expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations while the related accruals were included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Severance costs primarily consisted of severance benefits through payroll continuation, COBRA subsidies, outplacement services, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities.  
  Restructuring accruals of   $2.3 million   and   $6.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are recorded in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Severance benefits are expected to be paid in the next six months using cash from operations. The changes in the restructuring accrual for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows:

The following table summarizes the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income  during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The Company recognizes net periodic benefit cost in both Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales, depending on the functional area of the underlying employees included in the plans. 

14.    Common and Preferred Stock 
  On   December 1, 2015  , the Company s Board of Directors approved a   $300.0 million   increase in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. Repurchases will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased a total of   739 thousand   shares at a cost of   $55.0 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company purchased   2.4 million   shares at a cost of   $179.4 million  , of which   $4.3 million   was settled in   October     2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining is   $580.0 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   150 million   shares of authorized common stock, with a par value of   $.01   per share, and   5 million   shares of authorized preferred stock, with a par value of   $.01   per share.   No   preferred stock was outstanding at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Performance Share Units 
  Weighted average performance share unit fair values and assumptions for the period specified are disclosed below. The performance share units are market condition awards and have been assessed at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.   

A summary of the Company s performance share unit activity as of   September 30, 2016  , and changes during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , are presented in the following table: 

The Company granted   43,800   performance share units in February 2013, which vested on December 31, 2015.  Based on the Company s relative total shareholder return rank during the   three   year period ended December 31, 2015, the Company achieved a   200%   payout that resulted in   87,600   shares issued in February 2016. 
  Total compensation cost for performance share units is as follows: 

The Company s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, assuming forfeitures, over the requisite service period for the entire award. Classification of stock compensation cost within the Consolidated Statements of Operations is consistent with classification of cash compensation for the same employees. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $11.9 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.5   years,   $10 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.1   years, and   $7.6 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance share units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.1   years.

16.    Retirement Benefits 
  The Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement plans for its employees. The following tables provide the components of net periodic benefit cost for its major defined benefit plans and its other postretirement plans. 

The Company previously disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , that it expected to contribute approximately   $6.1 million   to its defined benefit plans and   $0.9 million   to its other postretirement benefit plans in   2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company now expects to contribute   $4.5 million   to its defined benefit plans and   $0.9 million   to its other postretirement benefit plans in   2016  . The Company contributed a total of   $4.5 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016   to fund these plans.   
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company implemented a program offering certain former U.S. employees with a vested pension benefit an option to take a one-time lump sum distribution rather than future monthly pension payments. The Company expects to make approximately   $8.0 million   to   $10.0 million   in payments from the plans in connection with this action and to incur an estimated pre-tax settlement loss of   $3.0 million   to   $6.0 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, since the final result of the offering is presently unknown, these amounts are subject to change. 

17.    Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which are expected to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

18.    Income Taxes 
   
  The Company s provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes   decreased   to   $29.4 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   from   $32.8 million   in the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate   increased   to   29.6%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   29.2%   in the same period of   2015   due to the incurrence of an additional   $5.2 million   of foreign withholding taxes, tax expense as a result of the divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the Ismatec product line.  These unfavorable items were offset by  tax benefits as a result of the divestiture of Melles Griot KK, certain return-to-provision adjustments, the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized in income, the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 on December 18, 2015 which, beginning in 2015, permanently extended the U.S. R D credit, as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.   

The provision for income taxes   decreased   to   $82.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $88.6 million   in the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate   decreased   to   27.7%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   29.2%   in the same period of   2015   due tax benefits as a result of the divestiture of Melles Griot KK, certain return-to-provision adjustments, the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized in income, the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 on December 18, 2015 which, beginning in 2015, permanently extended the U.S. R D credit, as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.  These favorable items were offset by the incurrence of additional   $5.2 million   of foreign withholding taxes and tax expense as a result of the divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the Ismatec product line. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.  Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of   zero   to   $2.7 million  . 

19.    Subsequent Events 
    
  On October 10, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and completed the sale of its IETG and 40Seven subsidiaries, based in Leeds, United Kingdom for cash consideration of   $2.8 million  , subject to customary post-closing adjustments.  The results of the subsidiaries were reported within the Fluid   Metering Technologies segment and generated revenues of   $12 million   in 2015.

Overview and Outlook 
  IDEX is an applied solutions company specializing in fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies, and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers  specifications. IDEX s products are sold in niche markets to a wide range of industries throughout the world. Accordingly, IDEX s businesses are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where it does business and by the relationship of the U.S. Dollar to other currencies. Levels of capacity utilization and capital spending in certain industries and overall industrial activity are among the factors that influence the demand for IDEX s products. 
  The Company has three reportable business segments: Fluid   Metering Technologies ( FMT ), Health   Science Technologies ( HST ) and Fire   Safety/Diversified Products ( FSDP ). Within our three reportable segments, the Company maintains fifteen platforms where we focus on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Each of our fifteen platforms is also a reporting unit, where we annually test goodwill for impairment.    
  The Fluid   Metering Technologies segment contains the Energy (comprised of Corken, Faure Herman, Liquid Controls, SAMPI, and Toptech), Valves (comprised of Alfa Valvole), Water (comprised of Pulsafeeder, Knight, ADS, and iPEK), Industrial (comprised of Richter, Viking, Aegis, Warren Rupp, and Trebor), and Agricultural (comprised of Banjo) platforms.

The Fire   Safety/Diversified Products segment produces firefighting pumps and controls, valves, monitors, nozzles, rescue tools, lifting bags and other components and systems for the fire and rescue industry, engineered stainless steel banding and clamping devices used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications, and precision equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing colorants and paints used in a variety of retail and commercial businesses around the world. 
  Management s primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income, and operating margin. In addition, due to the highly acquisitive nature of the Company, the determination of operating income includes amortization of acquired intangible assets and, as a result, management reviews depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales. These measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are analyzed with segment management. 
  This report references organic sales, a non-GAAP measure, that refers to sales calculated according to U.S. GAAP but excluding amounts from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months after acquisition or divestiture and the impact of foreign currency translation. The portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number  can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.  
  EBITDA means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Given the acquisitive nature of the Company, which results in a higher level of amortization expense at recently acquired businesses, management uses EBITDA as an internal operating metric to provide another representation of the businesses performance across our three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes. Management believes that EBITDA is useful to investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. Management believes EBITDA margin is useful for the same reason as EBITDA. EBITDA is also used to calculate certain financial covenants, as discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1,  Financial Statements.   
  Organic sales have been reconciled to net sales and EBITDA has been reconciled to net income in Item 2 under the heading  Non-GAAP Disclosures.  The reconciliation of segment EBITDA to net income was performed on a consolidated basis due to the fact that we do not allocate consolidated interest expense or the consolidated provision for income taxes to our segments.  
  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.  
  Some of our key financial results for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period from the prior year are as follows: 
             
    Sales of   $530 million     increased     5%  ; organic sales (which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation) were down 2%. 
                  
    EBITDA of   $133 million   was   25%   of sales and covered interest expense by more than   11   times. 
      Some of our key financial results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period from the prior year are as follows: 
             
    Sales of $  1.6 billion     increased     4%  ; organic sales (which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation) were down 2%. 
                
    Operating income of $  324 million     decreased     3%  . Adjusted operating income of   $326 million   increased   2%  .  
                 
    EBITDA of   $394 million   was   25%   of sales and covered interest expense by nearly   12   times.

Given the Company s current outlook, we are projecting fourth quarter   2016   adjusted EPS in the range of $0.92 to $0.94 with full year   2016   adjusted EPS of $3.72 to $3.74. We are also projecting full year revenue growth at 5% with full year organic revenue of negative 1%. 

Results of Operations 
  The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Segment operating income and EBITDA excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses of $16.1 million and operating income of $4.0 million for the   three months ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, and unallocated corporate operating expenses of $47.2 million and $30.3 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Corporate operating expenses include a net loss on sale of businesses of $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and an $18.1 million gain on sale of businesses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Consolidated Results for the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared with the Same Period of   2015    

For the   third quarter   of   2016  , Fluid   Metering Technologies contributed   39%   of sales,   44%   of operating income and   43%   of EBITDA; Health   Science Technologies accounted for   35%   of sales,   30%   of operating income and   33%   of EBITDA; and Fire   Safety/Diversified Products represented   26%   of sales, 26% of operating income and 24% of EBITDA. These percentages are calculated on the basis of total segment (not total Company) sales, operating income and EBITDA.  
  Sales in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $530.4 million  , a   5%     increase   from the comparable period last year. This   increase   reflects an 8% net increase from acquisitions (Novotema - June 2015, Alfa - June 2015, CPS - July 2015, Akron Brass - March 2016, AWG Fittings - July 2016 and SFC Koenig - September 2016) and divestitures (Ismatec - July 2015, Hydra- Stop - July 2016 and Melles Griot KK - September 2016), 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 2% decrease in organic sales. Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 48% of total sales in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to 52% during the same period in   2015  .  
  Gross profit of   $230.9 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016     increased     $7.6 million  , or   3%  , from the same period in   2015  . Gross margin of   43.5%   in the   third quarter   of   2016     decreased     80   basis points from   44.3%   during the same period in   2015  . The   decrease   in gross margin is primarily due to $4.6 million in fair value inventory step-up charges related to the AWG Fittings and SFC Koenig acquisitions.  The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the Akron Brass acquisition.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   to   $120.0 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   from   $114.8 million   during the same period of   2015  . The increase is primarily related to $10.5 million of incremental costs from acquisitions, partially offset by the benefits from prior year restructuring actions and cost controls. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were   22.6%   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , down   20   basis points from the   22.8%   for the same period of   2015  . 
  Operating income of   $108.9 million  , in the   third quarter   of   2016  , was   down   from the   $121.8 million   recorded during the same period in   2015  , while operating margin of   20.5%   for the   third quarter   of   2016  , was down compared to   24.2%   recorded during the same period in   2015  . The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily due to an $18.1 million gain on sale of a business in 2015 compared to a $2.1 million loss on sale of businesses in 2016 and higher fair value inventory step-up charges related to 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by the incremental impact of acquisitions and prior year restructuring actions.  
  Other (income) expense - net was   $(2.4) million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   $(0.7) million   of other (income) expense - net recorded in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to higher foreign currency translation gains in 2016. 
  Interest expense of   $11.9 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   was   up   from   $10.2 million   in   2015   primarily as a result of higher borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Facility and the Notes.  
  The provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes of   $29.4 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016     decreased   compared to   $32.8 million   recorded in the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate   increased   to   29.6%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   29.2%   in the same period of   2015   due to the incurrence of an additional $5.2 million of foreign withholding taxes, tax expense as a result of the

divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the Ismatec product line.  These unfavorable items were offset by tax benefits as a result of the divestiture of Melles Griot KK, certain return-to-provision adjustments, the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized in income, the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 on December 18, 2015 which, beginning in 2015, permanently extended the U.S. R D credit, as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.   
  Net income in the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $69.9 million     decreased   from   $79.5 million   during the same period of   2015  . Diluted earnings per share in the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.91     decreased     $0.11  , or   11%  , compared with the same period in   2015  . 
  Fluid   Metering Technologies Segment 

Sales of   $208.3 million     decreased     $3.8 million  , or   2%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with the same period of   2015  . This reflects a 1% decrease from divestitures (Hydra-Stop - July 2016) and a 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In the   third quarter   of   2016  , sales increased 4% domestically and decreased 9% internationally compared to the same period in   2015  . Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 43% of total segment sales during the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with 46% during the same period in   2015  . 
  Sales decreased in our Energy platform in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to challenges in the mobile and LPG markets partially offset by strength in the downstream OEM and aviation markets. Sales within our Industrial platform decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to continued softness in the North American industrial distribution market driven by oil   gas end markets and lower project volume. Sales decreased in the Water platform compared to the third quarter of 2015, due to the divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line as well as weakness in the United Kingdom and the chemical end market, partially offset by an increase in U.S. municipal service revenue. Sales within the Agricultural platform increased compared to the third quarter of 2015 as a result of increased sales volume to U.S. OEMs. Sales in the Valves platform decreased compared to 2015 as a result of softness in the oil and natural gas markets.  
  Operating income and operating margin of   $55.6 million   and   26.7%  , respectively, were   higher   than the   $46.9 million   and   22.1%   recorded in the   third quarter   of   2015  , primarily due to prior year restructuring actions and a fair value inventory step-up charge associated with the Alfa acquisition. 
  Health   Science Technologies Segment 

Sales of   $183.6 million     decreased     $1.3 million  , or   1%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . This reflects a 1% decrease in organic revenue, a 2% net increase from an acquisition (SFC Koenig - September 2016) and divestitures (Ismatec - July 2015 and Melles Griot KK - September 2016) and 2% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In the   third quarter   of   2016  , sales increased 10% domestically and decreased 8% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 53% of total segment sales in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with 58% during the same period in   2015  .  
  Sales within our Material Processing Technologies platform decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to the delivery of large capital projects in 2015, partially offset by strength in the pharmaceutical business. Sales increased compared to the third quarter of 2015 within our Scientific Fluidics platform due to continued strong demand in the analytical instrumentation, in-vitro diagnostic and bio end markets, partially offset by the July 2015 disposition of our Ismatec product line. Sales within our Sealing Solutions platform increased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to the acquisition of SFC Koenig and continued strength in semi-conductor markets, partially offset by continued softness in the oil   gas and heavy equipment markets. Sales within our Optics and Photonics platform decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to the divestiture of Melles Griot KK and a slow down in the Korean business unit, partially offset by strength in the optical systems   shutters and optical filters

end markets. Sales within our Gast platforms decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to continued softness in the North American industrial markets. Sales within the Micropump platform increased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to project wins within the printing end market. 
  Operating income and operating margin of   $37.2 million   and   20.3%  , respectively, in the   third quarter   of   2016   were   down   from the   $38.4 million   and   20.8%   recorded in the same period of   2015  , primarily due to a fair value inventory charge associated with the SFC Koenig acquisition, partially offset by prior year restructuring charges. 
  Fire   Safety/Diversified Products Segment 

Sales of   $138.8 million     increased     $31.8 million  , or   30%  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . This reflects a 6% decrease in organic revenue, 38% increase from acquisitions (Akron Brass - March 2016 and AWG Fittings - July 2016) and 2% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In the   third quarter   of   2016  , sales increased 38% domestically and 22% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 48% of total segment sales in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to 51% in the same period of   2015  .  
  Sales within our Dispensing platform were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sales within our Band-It platform decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to declines in upstream oil   gas sales and North American industrial, partially offset by strength in automotive end markets. Sales within our Fire Suppression platform increased due to the acquisitions of Akron Brass and AWG Fittings. Sales within our Rescue platform were down compared to 2015 primarily due to large projects in eastern Europe in the prior year.  
  Operating income of   $32.2 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   was lower than   $32.5 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   due to the Akron Brass and AWG Fittings acquisitions, partially offset by the fair value inventory step-up charge associated with the AWG Fittings acquisition. Operating margin of   23.2%   in the   third quarter   of   2016   was lower than the   30.4%   recorded in the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to the fair value inventory step-up charge related to the AWG Fittings acquisition and the dilutive impact of current year acquisitions resulting from a higher level of amortization as compared to the existing businesses.   
   
  Consolidated Results for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with the Same Period of   2015    

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Fluid   Metering Technologies contributed   41%   of sales,   43%   of operating income and   42%   of EBITDA; Health   Science Technologies contributed   35%   of sales,   32%   of operating income and   35%   of EBITDA; and Fire   Safety/Diversified Products contributed   24%   of sales,   25%   of operating income and   23%   of EBITDA. These percentages are calculated on the basis of total segment (not total Company) sales, operating income and EBITDA.  
  Sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $1,582.6 million  , which was a   4%     increase   compared to the same period last year. This reflects a 2% decrease in organic sales, a 7% net favorable impact from acquisitions (Alfa - June 2015; Novotema - June 2015; CPS - July 2015; Akron Brass - March 2016, AWG Fittings - July 2016 and SFC Koenig - September 2016) and divestitures (Ismatec - July 2015, Hydra-Stop - July 2016 and Melles Griot KK - September 2016) and 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation. Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 50% of total sales in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with 49% during the same period in   2015  .  
  Gross profit of   $698.3 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016     increased     $17.4 million  , or   3%  , from the same period in   2015  . Gross margin of   44.1%   in the first   nine   months of   2016     decreased     70   basis points from   44.8%   during the same period in   2015  ,  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

primarily due to higher fair value inventory step-up charges related to the 2016 acquisition.  Gross profit increased compared to 2015 as a result of a full year of prior year acquisitions and the 2016 Akron Brass acquisition. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   to   $371.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   from   $360.8 million   during the same period of   2015  . The change is due to $25.1 million of incremental costs from acquisitions, offset by benefits from prior period restructuring, cost controls and a $4.7 million reversal of a contingent consideration from a 2015 acquisition. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were   23.5%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , down   30   basis points compared to   23.8%   during the same period of   2015  . 
  Other (income) expense - net was   $(5.0) million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with   $(1.6) million   of other (income) expense - net recorded in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to higher foreign currency translation gains in the current year to date period. 
  Interest expense of   $33.6 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   up   from   $31.4 million   in   2015   primarily as a result of higher borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Facility and the Notes.  
  Operating income of   $324.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   down   from the   $333.5 million   recorded during the same period in   2015  , while operating margin of   20.5%   was down from   21.9%   recorded in the same period of   2015  . The decrease in operating income and margin is primarily due to higher fair value inventory step-up charges related to current year acquisitions and higher gain on sale of businesses in 2015, partially offset by the $4.7 million benefit from the reversal of the contingent consideration related to a prior year acquisition and prior year restructuring.  
  The provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes of $  82.0 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016     decreased   compared to $  88.6 million   recorded in the same period of   2015  . The effective tax rate   decreased   to   27.7%   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   29.2%   in the same period of   2015   due to tax benefits as a result of the divestiture of Melles Griot KK, certain return-to-provision adjustments, the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized in income, the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 on December 18, 2015 which, beginning in 2015, permanently extended the U.S. R D credit, as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.  These adjustments were offset by the incurrence of an additional $5.2 million of foreign withholding taxes, and tax expense as a result of  the divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the Ismatec product line. 
  Net income in the first   nine   months of   2016   of $  213.8 million     decreased   from $  215.0 million   during the same period of   2015  . Diluted earnings per share in the first   nine   months of   2016   of $  2.78     increased   $  0.03  , or   1%  , compared with the same period in   2015  . 
  Fluid   Metering Technologies Segment 

Sales of $  642.0 million   decreased by   1%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with the same period of   2015  . This reflects a 1% decrease in organic sales, a 1% favorable net impact from acquisitions (Alfa - June 2015) and divestitures (Hydra-Stop - July 2016), and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , sales decreased 2% domestically and increased 1% internationally compared to the same period in   2015  . Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 44% of total segment sales during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  . 
  Sales within our Energy platform were down slightly in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to challenges in the mobile and LPG end markets, partially offset by large international project shipments and strength within the aviation market. Sales within our Industrial platform decreased compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to softness in the North American industrial distribution market primarily as a result of the continued depression in the oil   gas market, softening of mining end markets and lower project volume. Sales within the Water platform were flat compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to an increase in municipal spending coupled with the mild winter offset by slowing demand in the United Kingdom and chemical end market and the divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line. Sales within our Agricultural platform decreased in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to continued overall softness within OEM markets. Sales in the Valves platform increased as a result of the Alfa acquisition in June 2015 and thus only had sales during a portion of the prior year.

Operating income and operating margins of $  160.9 million   and   25.1%  , respectively, in the first   nine   months of   2016   were higher than the $  154.7 million   and   24.0%  , respectively, recorded in the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to a full year of the Alfa acquisition included in the 2016 results and restructuring expenses incurred in the prior period. 
  Health   Science Technologies Segment 

Sales of $  556.5 million     increased   $  4.1 million  , or   1%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . This reflects a 2% net favorable impact from acquisitions (Novotema - June 2015, CPS - July 2015 and SFC Koenig - September 2016) and divestitures (Ismatec - July 2015 and Melles Griot KK - September 2016) and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , sales decreased 1% domestically and increased 2% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 55% of total segment sales in the first   nine   months of    2016   compared with 54% during the same period in   2015  . 
  Sales within our Material Processing Technologies platform were flat compared to the first nine months of 2015. Sales within our Scientific Fluidics platform were up compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to strong demand in all primary end markets and the full-year impact of the CPS acquisition, partially offset by the July 2015 divestiture of our Ismatec product line. Sales within our Sealing Solutions platform increased compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to the inclusion of a full year of the Novotema acquisition, the SFC Koenig acquisition and strength in the semi-conductor markets, partially offset by the weakened heavy equipment market and continued softness in the oil   gas markets. Sales within our Optics and Photonics platform decreased compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to weakness in the optical systems   shutters and laser optics end markets and the divestiture of Melles Griot KK, partially offset by stability within semi-conductor end markets. Sales within our Gast and Micropump platforms decreased compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to declines in the North American industrial distribution markets.  
  Operating income and operating margin of $  119.0 million   and   21.4%  , respectively, in the first   nine   months of   2016   were   up   from the $  117.9 million   and   21.3%  , respectively, recorded in the same period of   2015  , primarily due to higher volume and productivity improvements within the segment, partially offset by the inventory step-up charges associated with the SFC Koenig acquisition.  
  Fire   Safety/Diversified Products Segment 

Sales of $  385.0 million     increased   $  59.4 million  , or   18%  , in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . This reflects a 5% decline in organic revenue, a 24% favorable acquisition impact (Akron Brass - March 2016 and AWG Fittings - July 2016) and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , sales increased 23% domestically and increased 14% internationally, compared with the same period in   2015  . Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 51% of total segment sales in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to 52% during the same period of   2015  .  
  Sales within our Dispensing platform increased compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily driven by strong X-Smart sales in Asia and continued strength in deliveries to North American retailers. Sales within our Band-It platform decreased compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to the decline in upstream oil   gas markets, partially offset by strength within the transportation end markets. Sales within our Fire Suppression platform increased compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to the Akron Brass and AWG Fittings acquisitions. Sales within our Rescue platform were down compared to 2015, primarily due to project delays in Asian markets and large projects in eastern Europe in the prior year.

Operating income of $  91.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   higher   than the $  91.2 million   recorded in the same period of 2015 while operating margin of   23.8%   recorded in the first   nine   months of   2016   was lower than the   28.0%   recorded for the same period of 2015. The lower operating margin was due to the fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Akron Brass and AWG Fittings acquisitions and the dilutive impact of current year acquisitions resulting from a higher level of amortization as compared to the existing businesses. The higher operating income was due to the incremental impact of the current year acquisitions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Operating Activities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled   $239.4 million  , of which   $216.0 million   was held outside of the United States. At   September 30, 2016  , working capital was   $552.0 million   and the current ratio was   2.8   to 1. Cash flows from operating activities for the first   nine   months of   2016     increased     $22.5 million  , or   9%  , to   $284.3 million   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , due to improved working capital performance, lower bonus payments and the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 which no longer requires the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation to be shown as a reduction within cash flows from operating activities, partially offset by higher U.S. federal income tax payments. 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash flows   used in   investing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016     increased     $308.7 million   to   $506.2 million   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to $510.0 million spent on the acquisitions of Akron Brass, AWG Fittings, and SFC Koenig in 2016 compared to $193.2 spent on the acquisitions of Alfa, Novotema, and CPS in 2015, partially offset by $4.0 million in lower capital expenditures and $4.9 million in lower proceeds from sale of businesses.     
  Cash flows   provided by   operating activities were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of   $28.6 million   and   $32.6 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities. Management believes the Company has sufficient capacity in its plants and equipment to meet expected needs for future growth. 
  Financing Activities 
  Cash flows   provided by   financing activities for the first   nine   months was   $141.7 million   compared to cash flows used in financing activities of   $235.6 million   in the same period of   2015  , primarily as a result of increased borrowings to fund the Akron Brass acquisition combined with lower stock repurchases in 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015.  
  On June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of   $100 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.20%   Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 and   $100 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.37%   Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (collectively, the  Notes ) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the  Purchase Agreement ). Each series of Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13   th    and December 13   th   . The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the Notes; provided that such portion is greater than   5%   of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase Notes by making an offer to all holders of the Notes, subject to certain conditions. 
  The Credit Agreement consists of the Revolving Facility, which is a $700.0 million unsecured, multi-currency bank credit facility expiring on June 23, 2020. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $255.1 million   of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately   $8.2 million  . The net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at   September 30, 2016  , was approximately   $436.7 million  . Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the Company s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from   .005%   to   1.50%  . Based on the Company s credit rating at   September 30, 2016  , the applicable margin was   1.10%  , resulting in a weighted average interest rate of   1.34%   at   September 30, 2016  . Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. An annual Revolving Facility fee, also based on the Company s credit rating, is currently 15 basis points and is payable quarterly. 
  There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the Notes, which require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of   3.50   to   1  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company s interest coverage ratio was 12.25 to 1 and the leverage ratio was 1.98 to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 4.5% Senior Notes or 4.2% Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions.

On   December 1, 2015  , the Company s Board of Directors approved a   $300.0 million   increase in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company purchased a total of   739 thousand   shares at a cost of   $55.0 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company purchased   2.4 million   shares at a cost of   $179.4 million  , of which   $4.3 million   was settled in   October     2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining is   $580.0 million  . 
  The Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, expected share repurchases and annual dividend payments to holders of the Company s stock for the remainder of   2016  . Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings.  

Non-GAAP Disclosures 
  Set forth below are reconciliations of EBITDA to the comparable measures of net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have reconciled consolidated EBITDA and segment EBITDA to net income. The reconciliation of segment EBITDA to net income was performed on a consolidated basis due to the fact that we do not allocate consolidated interest expense or the consolidated provision for income taxes to our segments. 
  EBITDA means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Given the acquisitive nature of the Company, which results in a higher level of amortization expense at recently acquired businesses, management uses EBITDA as an internal operating metric to provide another representation of the businesses performance across our three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes. Management believes that EBITDA is useful to investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. Management believes EBITDA margin is useful for the same reason as EBITDA.  EBITDA is also used to calculate certain financial covenants, as discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1,  Financial Statements.   
  This report references organic sales, a non-GAAP measure, that refers to sales calculated according to U.S. GAAP but excluding amounts from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months after acquisition or divestiture and the impact of foreign currency translation. The portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult due to the varying nature, size and number of transactions from period to period and between the Company and its peers. 
  The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, provides for procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Under the policy, the Company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading purposes, and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the Company s outstanding long-term debt. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
  The Company s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Indian Rupee and Chinese Renminbi. The Company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the cost incurred to produce our products. The effect of transaction gains and losses is reported within other (income) expense-net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Interest Rate Fluctuation 
  The Company s interest rate exposure is primarily related to the   $1.1 billion   of total debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Approximately   23%   of the debt, representing the amount drawn on the Revolving Facility at   September 30, 2016  , is priced at interest rates that float with the market. A 50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximate   $1.3 million   annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows. The remaining debt is fixed rate debt. 

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures. 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of   September 30, 2016  , that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  There has been no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings. 
     The Company and six of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries, allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos. These components were acquired from third party suppliers, and were not manufactured by the Company or any of the defendant subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance, subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover these settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance have been settled for various insignificant amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the Company s business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe the asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  The Company is also party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which are expected to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item 2.  
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
     The following table provides information about the Company s purchases of its common stock during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    On   December 1, 2015  , the Company announced that its Board of Directors had increased the authorized level for repurchases of its common stock by   $300.0 million  . This followed the prior Board of Directors repurchase authorization of $400.0 million, announced by the Company on November 6, 2014. These authorizations have no expiration date.
