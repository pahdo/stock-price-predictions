FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This
report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not directly or exclusively
relate to historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  may,   will, 
 should,   could,   would,   expects,   plans,   anticipates, 
 believes,   estimates,   projects,   forecasts,   predicts,   potential, 
or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions and comparable terminology. These include, but are not limited to, statements
relating to future events or our future financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these expectations may not be achieved.
Forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors outside of our control that could cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Actual results
may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.  

You
should consider the areas of risk described in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made herein. You should
also consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 17, 2016, which address additional factors that could
cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include:  

our
    ability to successfully execute our business strategies, including the acquisition of other businesses to grow our company
    and integration of recent and future acquisitions;   

changes
    in aggregate capital spending, cyclicality and other economic conditions, and domestic and international demand in the industries
    we serve;   

our
    ability to adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry s
    and customers  evolving demands;   

our
    ability to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when required;   

our
    ability to adequately expand our sales force and attract and retain key personnel and skilled labor;   

shifts
    in geographic concentration of our customers, supplies and labor pools and seasonal fluctuations in demand for our services;   

our
    dependence on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts;   

our
    competitors developing the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price
    and quality to our services;   

our
    material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and our ability to maintain effective controls over financial
    reporting in the future;    

our
    ability to comply with certain financial covenants of our debt obligations;    

the
    impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct
    our business;   

changes
    in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including
    those resulting from natural or man-made disasters;   

we
    may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, which could harm our profitability; and   

our
    auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   

These
forward-looking statements also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or
persons acting on our behalf may issue. All written and oral forward looking statements made in connection with this report that
are attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary
statements. Given these uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and you
should carefully review this report in its entirety. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report,
and you should not rely on these statements without also considering the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements
and our business.

release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated
events. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts  expectations or estimates or to release publicly

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Overview    

InterCloud Systems, Inc.
(the  Company ) was incorporated on November 22, 1999 under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a provider of
cloud networking orchestration and automation for software-defined networking and network function virtualization cloud environments
to the telecommunications service provider and corporate enterprise markets through cloud solutions and professional services.
The Company s cloud solutions offer enterprise and service-provider customers the opportunity to adopt an operational expense
model by outsourcing cloud deployment and management rather than the capital expense model that has dominated in recent decades
in IT infrastructure management. The Company s professional services group offers a broad range of solutions to enterprise
and service provider customers, including application development teams, analytics, project management, program management, unified
communications, network management and field support services on a short and long-term basis. The Company s applications
and infrastructure division offers enterprise and service provider customers specialty contracting services, including engineering,
design, installation and maintenance services, that support the build-out and operation of some of the most advanced small cell,
Wi-Fi and distributed antenna system networks. 

Principles
of Consolidation and Accounting for Investments in Affiliate Companies    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include Tropical Communications, Inc. ( Tropical ) (since
August 2011), Rives-Monteiro Leasing, LLC ( RM Leasing ) (since December 2011), ADEX Corporation, ADEX Puerto Rico,
LLC and HighWire (collectively,  ADEX  or  ADEX Entities ) (since September 2012), TNS, Inc. ( TNS )
(since September 2012), AW Solutions, Inc. and AW Solutions Puerto Rico, LLC (collectively, the  AWS Entities ) (since
April 2013), Integration Partners   NY Corporation ( IPC ) (since January 2014), RentVM Inc. ( RentVM )
(since February 2014), and SDN Essentials, LLC ( SDN ) (since January 2016). The results of operations of the Company s
former subsidiaries, VaultLogix, LLC ( VaultLogix ) (since October 2014) and PCS Holding LLC ( Axim )
(since December 2014), have been included as discontinued operations on the accompanying financial statements. In February 2016,
the Company consummated the sale of certain assets of VaultLogix and in April 2016, the Company consummated the sale of all assets
of Axim (see Note 14, Discontinued Operations). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  

In
September 2016, the Company s subsidiary, AW Solutions, Inc., acquired the assets of 8760 Enterprises, Inc. ( 8760
Enterprises ), a comprehensive facility performance monitoring company that offers a management suite that controls building
automation and energy functions though an integrated platform.  

The Company consolidates
all entities in which it has a controlling voting interest or a variable interest in a variable interest entity ( VIE )
in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rives-Montiero Engineering, LLC ( RM Engineering )
(since December 2011), in which the Company owns an interest of 49%. The Company has the ability to exercise its call option to
acquire the remaining 51% of RM Engineering for a nominal amount and thus makes all significant decisions related to RM Engineering
even though it absorbs only 49% of the losses. Additionally, substantially all of the entity s activities either involve
or are conducted on behalf of the entity by the 51% holder of RM Engineering.  

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nottingham Enterprises LLC ( Nottingham ),
in which the Company owns an interest of 40%. Nottingham is a VIE because it meets the following criteria: (i) the entity has
insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties and the 60%
owner guarantees its debt, (ii) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected
losses of the legal entity, and (iii) substantially all of the legal entity s activities either involve or are conducted
on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The Company has the ability to exercise its call option
to acquire the remaining 60% of Nottingham for a nominal amount and thus makes all significant decisions related to Nottingham
even though it absorbs only 40% of the losses. Additionally, substantially all of the entity s activities either involve
or are conducted on behalf of the entity by the 60% holder of Nottingham.  

The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the Company s 13.7% ownership interest in NGNWare, LLC ( NGNWare ).
The Company does not hold a controlling financial interest in NGNWare but has the ability to exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of NGNWare. As such, the Company accounts for its investment in NGNWare under the equity
method of accounting. 

The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are, in the opinion
of management, necessary for a fair presentation of such statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
Additionally, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the entire year.

Restatement
of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements    

As disclosed in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and on the Company s Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended September
30, 2015, the Company has restated the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2015 to correct misstatements primarily related to the following matters: 

(i) The Company determined
that maintenance pass-through revenue within the Company s Integration Partners   NY Corporation subsidiary was presented
on the gross amount billed to customers.  Based on the year-end 2015 audit, the revenue associated with maintenance contracts
associated with these customers should have been presented on the net amount retained. An entry was recorded related to this audit
finding during the third quarter of 2015.  As a result, the Company decreased service revenues by $1.4 million and the associated
cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015; 

(ii) The Company identified
an error related to a customer payment received in the second quarter of 2015. This amount was properly recorded as deferred revenue
in the second quarter; however, the revenue and cost of revenue associated with that transaction were not properly recognized during
the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in an understatement of product revenue in the amount of $0.7 million, cost of revenue
in the amount of $0.2 million and gross profit in the amount of $0.5 million for the third quarter of 2015. This error also resulted
in an overstatement of liabilities of $0.2 million at September 30, 2015; 

(iii) The Company identified
an error related to the cost of inventory items sold during the third quarter of 2015, which resulted in an understatement of
cost of revenue by $0.9 million and an overstatement of inventory by such amount during the third quarter ended September 30,
2015; and 

(iv) The Company determined that it did not retain adequate documentation to support the usage of the
percentage of completion method of accounting for certain contracts within the AWS Entities. As such, the Company reversed revenues
and related cost of sales that were recorded during the third quarter of 2015 using the percentage of completion method of accounting,
which resulted in a decrease in service revenues of $0.8 million and a related decrease in accounts receivable by such amount during
the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  In addition, the adjustments also reduced cost of revenue by $0.6 million during such
period and caused a related increase in deferred job costs that were included in other current assets on the unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015. 

These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the impact of the restatement on the comparative unaudited consolidated quarterly financial
information for the three and nine months ended and as of September 30, 2015. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
for the three and nine months quarter and as of September 30, 2015, included in the Company s amended Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015, filed with the SEC on June 17, 2016; and the Company s audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with
the SEC on June 17, 2016. 

Business
Combinations    

The Company accounts for
its business combinations under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805-10,  Business
Combinations  ( ASC 805-10 ), which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including non-controlling interests, are recorded at the date of acquisition
at their respective fair values. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination
must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value
of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized
separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred. If the business combination provides for contingent consideration,
the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date and any changes in fair value after the
acquisition date are accounted for as measurement-period adjustments if they pertain to additional information about facts and
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date and that the Company obtained during the measurement period. Changes in fair
value of contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as earn-outs, are recognized as follows:
1) if the contingent consideration is classified as equity, the contingent consideration is not re-measured and its subsequent
settlement is accounted for within equity, or 2) if the contingent consideration is classified as a liability, the changes in
fair value are recognized in earnings. 

The
estimated fair value of net assets acquired, including the allocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities,
was determined using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy (see Fair Value of Financial Instruments below). The estimated
fair value of the net assets acquired was determined using the income approach to valuation based on the discounted cash flow
method. Under this method, expected future cash flows of the business on a stand-alone basis are discounted back to a present
value. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, the trade names and non-compete
agreements acquired, also were determined using an income approach to valuation based on excess cash flow, relief of royalty and
discounted cash flow methods.  

The
discounted cash flow valuation method requires the use of assumptions, the most significant of which include: future revenue growth,
future earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, estimated synergies to be achieved by a market participant
because of the business combination, marginal tax rate, terminal value growth rate, weighted average cost of capital and discount
rate.

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   (DOLLAR
AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)   

   (UNAUDITED)   

The
excess earnings method used to value customer relationships requires the use of assumptions, the most significant of which include:
the remaining useful life, expected revenue, survivor curve, earnings before interest and tax margins, marginal tax rate, contributory
asset charges, discount rate and tax amortization benefit.  

The
most significant assumptions under the relief of royalty method used to value trade names include: estimated remaining useful
life, expected revenue, royalty rate, tax rate, discount rate and tax amortization benefit. The discounted cash flow method used
to value non-compete agreements includes assumptions such as: expected revenue, term of the non-compete agreements, probability
and ability to compete, operating margin, tax rate and discount rate. Management, with the assistance of a third-party valuation
specialist, has developed these assumptions based on historical knowledge of the business and projected financial information
of the Company. These assumptions may vary based on future events, perceptions of different market participants and other factors
outside the control of management, and such variations may be significant to estimated values.  

Segment
Information    

The
Company operates in three operating segments   as an applications and infrastructure provider, as a professional services
provider, and as a managed services provider. The applications and infrastructure segment provides engineering and professional
consulting services and voice, data and optical solutions. The engineering, design, installation and maintenance services of the
applications and infrastructure segment support the build-out and operation of enterprise, fiber optic, Ethernet and wireless
networks. The professional services segment provides outsourced services to the wireless and wireline industry and information
technology industry. The managed services segment provides hardware and software products to customers and provides maintenance
and support for those products.  

The
Company s reporting units have been aggregated into one of three operating segments due to their similar economic characteristics,
products, or production and distribution methods. The first operating segment is applications and infrastructure, which is comprised
of the components TNS, the AWS Entities, Tropical, RM Leasing, and RM Engineering. The Company s second operating segment
is professional services, which consists of the ADEX Entities and SDN. The Company s third operating segment is managed
services, which consists of the IPC, RentVM and Nottingham components. The operating segments mentioned above constitute reporting
segments.  

During
2016, the Company consummated the sale of certain assets of its former VaultLogix and Axim subsidiaries. These subsidiaries comprised
the Company s former cloud services segment. The cloud services segment provided cloud computing and storage services to
customers.

are generated from its three reportable segments: applications and infrastructure, professional services, and managed services.
The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 605-10,  Revenue Recognition . The Company recognizes
revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 

The applications and infrastructure
segment revenues are derived from contracts to provide technical engineering services along with contracting services to commercial
and governmental customers. The contracts of TNS, Tropical and RM Engineering provide that payment for the Company s services
may be based on either direct labor hours at fixed hourly rates or fixed-price contracts. The services provided under the contracts
are generally provided within one month. Occasionally, the services may be provided over a period of up to six months. 

The AWS Entities generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method. Revenues and fees
under the contracts of these entities were recognized utilizing the units-of-delivery method, which used measures such as task
completion within an overall contract. The units-of-delivery approach is an output method used in situations where it is more representative
of progress on a contract than an input method, such as the efforts-expended approach. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts, if any, are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance conditions and final
contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income, which are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. 

The
AWS Entities also generate revenue from service contracts with certain customers. These contracts are accounted for under the
proportional performance method. Under this method, revenue is recognized in proportion to the value provided to the customer
for each project as of each reporting date.  

The revenues of the Company s
professional services segment, which is comprised of the ADEX Entities and SDN, are derived from contracted services to provide
technical engineering and management solutions to large voice and data communications providers, as specified by their clients.
The contracts provide that payments made for the Company s services may be based on either direct labor hours at fixed hourly
rates or fixed-price contracts. The services provided under these contracts are generally provided within one month. Occasionally,
the services may be provided over a period of up to four months. If it is anticipated that the services will span a period exceeding
one month, depending on the contract terms, the Company will provide either progress billing at least once a month or upon completion
of the clients  specifications. The aggregate amount of unbilled work-in-progress recognized as revenues was insignificant
at September 30, 2016 and 2015.

ADEX s HighWire division generates
revenue through its telecommunications engineering group, which contracts with telecommunications infrastructure manufacturers
to install the manufacturer s products for end users. The High Wire division recognizes revenue using the proportional performance
method. Management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized using the proportional performance
method. If management made different judgments and estimates, then the amount and timing of revenue for any period could differ
materially from the reported revenue. 

The
Company s TNS and IPC subsidiaries, as well as ADEX s HighWire division, sometimes require customers to provide a
deposit prior to beginning work on a project. When this occurs, the deposit is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized
in revenue when the work is complete.  

The
Company s IPC subsidiary, which is included in the Company s managed services segment, is a value-added reseller that
generates revenues from the resale of voice, video and data networking hardware and software contracted services for design, implementation
and maintenance services for voice, video, and data networking infrastructure. IPC s customers are higher education organizations,
governmental agencies and commercial customers. IPC also provides maintenance and support and professional services. For certain
maintenance contracts, IPC assumes responsibility for fulfilling the support to customers and recognizes the associated revenue
either on a ratable basis over the life of the contract or, if a customer purchases a time and materials maintenance program,
as maintenance is provided to the customer.  Revenue for the sale of third-party maintenance contracts is recognized net
of the related cost of revenue.  In a maintenance contract, all services are provided by the Company s third-party
providers. As a result, the Company concluded that IPC is acting as an agent and IPC recognizes revenue on a net basis at the
date of sale with revenue being equal to the gross margin on the transaction.  As IPC is under no obligation to perform additional
services, revenue is recognized at the time of sale rather than over the life of the maintenance agreement.  

IPC
also generates revenue through the sale of a subscription-based cloud services to its customers. Revenue related to these customers
is deferred until the services are performed.  

For
multiple-element arrangements, IPC recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605-25,  Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables .
The Company allocates revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following
hierarchy: first vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ), then third-party evidence ( TPE ) of selling
price if VSOE is not available, and finally the Company s estimate of the selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.
VSOE exists when the Company sells the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by the Company for each
deliverable. Estimated selling price reflects the Company s best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable
would be if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of the Company s
business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. Each element that has stand-alone value is
accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. Revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is
provided or the product is delivered.   

The Company s former
VaultLogix subsidiary, which was included in the Company s former cloud services segment, provided on-line data backup services
to its customers. Revenue for these customers was deferred until the services were performed. 

Inventory    

The
inventory balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 related to the Company s IPC subsidiary. IPC purchases inventory
for resale to customers and records it at the lower of cost or market until sold. As inventory relates to specific customer orders,
the Company determines the cost of the inventory using the specific identification method. Inventory consisted of networking equipment
for which title had not passed to customers as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Goodwill
and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets    

Goodwill
was generated through the acquisitions made by the Company. As the total consideration paid exceeded the value of the net assets
acquired, the Company recorded goodwill for each of the completed acquisitions. At the date of acquisition, the Company performed
a valuation to determine the value of the intangible assets, along with the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired. The
goodwill is attributable to synergies and economies of scale provided to the Company by the acquired entity.  

The
Company tests its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually (as of October 1) and whenever
events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining
if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in the Company s
expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in the Company s stock price and market capitalization; a significant
adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate of the Company s segments; unanticipated competition; and slower
growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill, the indefinite-lived
intangible assets and the Company s consolidated financial results.

During
2015, indicators of potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were identified by management in the
managed services segment. The Company's management then determined that the IPC reporting unit assets were impaired and recognized
an impairment loss as of December 31, 2015 related to intangible assets as the carrying value of the IPC reporting unit was in
excess of its fair value. If IPC s projected long-term sales growth rate, profit margins or terminal rate continue to change,
or the assumed weighted-average cost of capital is considerably higher, future testing may indicate additional impairment in this
reporting unit and, as a result, the remaining assets may also be impaired.  

During 2015, indicators of potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were identified
by management in the Company s former cloud services segment. The Company's management then determined that the Axim operating
segment assets were impaired and recognized an impairment loss as of December 31, 2015 related to intangible assets as the carrying
value of the Axim reporting unit was in excess of its fair value. If Axim s projected long-term sales growth rate, profit
margins or terminal rate continue to change, or the assumed weighted-average cost of capital is considerably higher, future testing
may indicate additional impairment in this reporting unit and, as a result, the remaining assets may also be impaired. 

During December 2015, the Company entered into a letter of intent with a third-party to sell VaultLogix and
its two subsidiaries, which were included in the Company s former cloud services segment. The agreement was executed and
the sale was consummated in February 2016. The Company s management assessed the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities
of VaultLogix and its subsidiaries as compared to the selling price and determined that an impairment existed as of December 31,
2015. The Company recognized an impairment loss as of December 31, 2015, as the carrying value of the VaultLogix business unit
was in excess of the amount for which it was sold in an arm s-length transaction.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company did not identify any indicators of impairment.  

Commitments
and Contingencies    

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various contingencies. The Company records any contingencies in the consolidated
financial statements when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable,
or otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC Topic 450,  Contingencies  ( ASC Topic 450 ). Significant judgment
is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. In the
event the Company determines that a loss is not probable, but is reasonably possible, and it becomes possible to develop what
the Company believes to be a reasonable range of possible loss, then the Company will include disclosures related to such matter
as appropriate and in compliance with ASC Topic 450. To the extent there is a reasonable possibility that the losses could exceed
the amounts already accrued, the Company will, when applicable, adjust the accrual in the period in which the determination is
made, disclose an estimate of the additional loss or range of loss, indicate that the estimate is immaterial with respect to its
financial statements as a whole or, if the amount of such adjustment cannot be reasonably estimated, disclose that an estimate
cannot be made.  

Purported
Class Action Suit   

In
March 2014, a complaint entitled   In re InterCloud Systems Sec. Litigation,    Case No. 3:14-cv-01982
(D.N.J.)  was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company, the
Company s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Munro, The DreamTeamGroup and MissionIR, as purported
securities advertisers and investor relations firms, and John Mylant, a purported investor and investment advisor. The
complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of a class of certain persons who purchased the Company s common stock
between November 5, 2013 and March 17, 2014. The complaint alleged violations by the defendants (other than Mark Munro) of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and other related provisions in connection with certain alleged courses of conduct that
were intended to deceive the plaintiff and the investing public and to cause the members of the purported class to purchase
shares of the Company s common stock at artificially inflated prices based on untrue statements of a material fact or
omissions to state material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading. The complaint also alleged that Mr. Munro
and the Company violated Section 20 of the Exchange Act as controlling persons of the other defendants. The complaint seeks
unspecified damages, attorney and expert fees, and other unspecified litigation costs.

Securities
and Exchange Commission Subpoenas   

On
May 21, 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC that stated that the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation
 In the Matter of Galena Biopharma, Inc. File No. HO 12356 (now known as  In the Matter of Certain Stock Promotions )
 and that the subpoena was issued to the Company as part of an investigation as to whether certain investor relations firms
and their clients engaged in market manipulation. The subpoena and accompanying letter did not indicate whether the Company is,
or is not, under investigation. Since May 2014, the Company provided testimony to the SEC and produced documents in response to
that subpoena and several additional subpoenas received from the SEC in connection with that matter, including a subpoena issued
on March 1, 2016 requesting information relating to a transaction involving the Company s Series H preferred shares in December
2013.  

In
connection with the SEC investigation, in May 2015, the Company received information from the SEC that it is continuing an investigation
of the Company and certain of its current and former officers, consultants of the Company and others, of  possible violation[s] 
of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules of the SEC thereunder in the offer or sale of securities and certain other matters with respect to which
the SEC claims it has information, including the possible market manipulation of the Company s securities dating back to
January 2013. Based upon the Company s internal investigations, the Company does not believe either the Company or any of
its current or former officers or directors engaged in any activities that violated applicable securities laws. The Company intends
to continue to work with the staff of the SEC towards a resolution and to supplement the Company s disclosure regarding
the SEC s investigation accordingly.  

The
Company is unaware of the scope or timing of the SEC s investigation. As a result, the Company does not know how the SEC
investigation is proceeding, when the investigation will be concluded, or what action, if any, might be taken in the future by
the SEC or its staff as a result of the matters that are the subject of its investigation. The Company is seeking to cooperate
with the SEC in its investigation.  

Breach of Contract Action  

In July 2013, a complaint was filed against the Company in the Circuit Court of the 15 th  Judicial Circuit in and for
Palm Beach County, Florida titled  The Farkas Group, Inc., The Atlas Group of Companies, LLC and Michael D. Farkas v. InterCloud
Systems, Inc.  (Case No. 502013CA01133XXXMB) for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.  In the complaint, the plaintiffs
allege that the Company has breached contractual agreements between the Company and plaintiffs pertaining to certain indebtedness
amounting to approximately $116,000 allegedly owed by the Company to the plaintiffs and the Company s agreement to convert
such indebtedness into shares of the Company s common stock.  The Company has asserted as a defense that such indebtedness,
together with any right to convert such indebtedness into shares of common stock, was cancelled pursuant to the terms of a Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of July 2, 2009 between the Company and the plaintiffs. The Farkas Group was a control person of the
Company during the period that it was a public  shell  company, and facilitated the transfer of control of the Company
to its former chief executive officer, Gideon Taylor.

As of September 30, 2016,
no accruals for loss contingencies have been recorded as the outcomes of these cases are neither probable or reasonably estimable. 

The
Company has obligations contingent on the performance of its subsidiaries. These contingent obligations, payable to the former
owners of the subsidiaries, are based on metrics that contain escalation clauses. The Company believes that the amounts recorded
within the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets are indicative of fair value and are also considered the most
likely payout of these obligations. If conditions were to change, these liabilities could potentially impact the Company s
results of operations, financial condition and future cash flows.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation  ( ASC
Topic 718 ). Under the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the
grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, based on the terms of the awards.  

Net Income (Loss) Per Share   

The
Company follows ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share , which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share
( EPS ) on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures, and requires a reconciliation
of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  

In the accompanying financial
statements, basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. 

Diluted income (loss) per share is computed in a manner similar to the basic income (loss) per share, except
the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to include all common shares, including those with the potential
to be issued by virtue of warrants, options, convertible debt and other such convertible instruments. Diluted loss per share contemplates
a complete conversion to common shares of all convertible instruments only if they are dilutive in nature with regards to earnings
per share. 

The
following sets forth the computation of diluted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2016:  

Potential
common shares includable in the computation of fully-diluted per share results are not presented for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and the three or nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  

The
anti-dilutive shares of common stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

ASC
Topic 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC Topic 820 ) provides a framework for measuring fair value
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   

ASC
Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs)
and (2) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in
the circumstances (unobservable inputs).  

The
fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows:  

Level
    1    
      Unadjusted
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.   

Level
    2    
      Inputs
    other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
    Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
    assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
    liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other
    means.   

Level
    3    
      Inputs
    that are unobservable for the asset or liability.   

The
following section describes the valuation methodologies that the Company used to measure different financial instruments at fair
value.  

Debt   

The fair value of the
Company s debt approximates the carrying value. Factors that the Company considered when estimating the fair value of its
debt included market conditions, liquidity levels in the private placement market, variability in pricing from multiple lenders
and the term of the debt. The level of the debt would be considered as Level 2. 

Contingent
Consideration   

The
fair value of the Company s contingent consideration is based on the Company s evaluation as to the probability and
amount of any earn-out that will be achieved based on expected future performance by the acquired entity. The Company utilizes
a third-party valuation firm to assist in the calculation of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date. The Company
evaluates the forecast of the acquired entity and the probability of earn-out provisions being achieved when it evaluates the
contingent consideration at initial acquisition date and at each subsequent reporting period. The fair value of contingent consideration
is measured at each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. The Company evaluates the terms in contingent consideration arrangements
provided to former owners of acquired companies who become employees of the Company to determine if such amounts are part of the
purchase price of the acquired entity or compensation.  

Additional
Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements   

The
carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their
fair value due to the short-term maturity of those items.   

Fair
Value of Derivatives   

The
Company has historically utilized a Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the derivative liability
related to the warrants and the put and effective price of future equity offerings of equity-linked financial instruments. During
the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company determined that it would utilize a binomial lattice pricing model to determine
the fair value of the derivative liability related to the warrants and the put and effective price of future equity offerings
of equity-linked financial instruments. The Company has evaluated its derivative instruments and determined that the value of
those derivative instruments, using a binomial lattice pricing model instead of a Black-Scholes pricing model, would be immaterial
on its historical unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015.

Accounting Pronouncements    

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU
2016-15 ) .  ASU 2016-15 eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts
and payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the maturing of a zero coupon bond, the settlement of contingent liabilities
arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, distributions from certain equity method investees and
beneficial interests obtained in a financial asset securitization. ASU 2016-15 designates the appropriate cash flow classification,
including requirements to allocate certain components of these cash receipts and payments among operating, investing and financing
activities. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-15 on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND MANAGEMENT S PLANS   

The Company s management
believes that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes
that its available cash balance as of the date of this filing will not be sufficient to fund its anticipated level of operations
for at least the next 12 months. The Company s management believes the Company s ability to continue operations depends
on its ability to sustain and grow revenue and results of operations as well as the Company s ability to access capital
markets when necessary to accomplish the Company s strategic objectives. The Company s management believes that the
Company will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
generated gross profits from operations but failed to achieve positive cash flow from operations. The Company expects to finance
future cash needs from the results of operations and the sale of certain operating assets or businesses. Depending on the results
of operations, the Company may need additional equity or debt financing until the Company can achieve profitability and positive
cash flows from operating activities, if ever. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company
suffered recurring losses from operations. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a total stockholders 
deficit of $8,413 and $4,200, respectively. The decrease of $8,498 in the Company s working capital from December 31, 2015
to September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5,648 (including non-cash
activity) and an increase in the current portion of term loans (net of debt discounts) of $2,826. In addition, certain of the Company s
derivative instruments in the amount of $1,287 are now due to mature by September 30, 2017, whereas only $408 of these derivative
instruments were current as of December 31, 2015. 

On
or prior to September 30, 2017, the Company has obligations relating to the payment of indebtedness as follows:  

$5,403 relating to promissory notes held by related parties that mature on July 1, 2017;   

$5,755 relating to a promissory note held by a related party that matured on May 30, 2016 and is due on demand;   

$2,020 relating to term loans   senior convertible notes with current portions payable through January 2017;   

$306 relating to current maturities of a convertible note that matures in November 2016;   

$363 relating to current maturities of a convertible note that matures in January 2017;   

$225 relating to a promissory note held by a related party that matured on May 30, 2016 and is due on demand;   

$106 relating to a promissory note held by a former owner of Tropical that matures in November 2016;   

$75 relating to a promissory note held
by a related party that is due on demand; and 

$349 relating to the settlement of IPC-Related
        Litigation discussed in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings  

The Company anticipates meeting
its cash obligations on indebtedness that is payable on or prior to September 30, 2017 from earnings from operations, the sale
of certain operating assets or businesses and possibly from the proceeds of additional indebtedness or equity raises. If the Company
is not successful in obtaining additional financing when required, the Company expects that it will be able to renegotiate and
extend certain of its notes payable as required to enable it to meet its remaining debt obligations as they become due, although
there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so.

The Company s future
capital requirements for its operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of its businesses, the number
and cash requirements of other acquisition candidates that the Company pursues, and the costs of operations. The Company has been
investing in sales personnel in anticipation of increasing revenue opportunities in managed services segments of its business,
which contributed to the losses from operations. The Company s management has taken several actions to ensure that it will
have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, including the reduction of certain general and administrative expenses, consulting
expenses and other professional services fees. Additionally, if the Company s actual revenues are less than forecasted, the
Company anticipates implementing headcount reductions to a level that more appropriately matches then-current revenue and expense
levels. The Company is evaluating other measures to further improve its liquidity, including the sale of certain operating assets
or businesses, the sale of equity or debt securities and entering into joint ventures with third parties. Lastly, the Company may
elect to reduce certain related-party and third-party debt by converting such debt into common shares. The Company s management
believes that these actions will enable the Company to meet its liquidity requirements through September 30, 2017. There is no
assurance that the Company will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that it may undertake to fund operations over the
next 12 months. 

The Company plans to generate
positive cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. However, to execute the Company s business plan, service existing indebtedness
and implement its business strategy, the Company anticipates that it will need to obtain additional financing from time to time
and may choose to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, borrowings
from affiliates or other arrangements. The Company cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on
terms favorable to the Company or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked
securities may dilute the Company s current stockholders  ownership and could also result in a decrease in the market
price of the Company s common stock. The terms of any securities issued by the Company in future capital transactions may
be more favorable to new investors and may include the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further
dilutive effect. The Company also may be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities it issues,
such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact the Company s financial condition. Furthermore, any debt
financing, if available, may subject the Company to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to raise additional capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form.

MidMarket
Warrants   

The Company issued warrants
to lenders in 2012. These warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The
terms of the warrants issued in September 2012 originally provided, among other things, that the number of shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise of such warrants amounted to 11.5% of the Company s fully-diluted outstanding common stock and common
stock equivalents, whether the common stock equivalents were fully vested and exercisable or not, and that the initial exercise
price of such warrants was $5.00 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment. Pursuant to an amendment to the loan agreement,
on March 22, 2013, the number of shares for which the warrants are exercisable was fixed at 234,233 shares. On September 17, 2012,
when the warrants were issued, the Company recorded a derivative liability in the amount of $194. The amount was recorded as a
debt discount and is being amortized over the original life of the related loans. The amount of the derivative liability was computed
by using the Black-Scholes pricing model, which is not materially different from a binomial lattice valuation methodology, to
determine the value of the warrants issued.

On September 17, 2016,
the fourth anniversary date of the warrants, the Company failed to meet the minimum adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization provisions set forth within the original warrant agreement. As such, the expiration date of the
warrants was extended to September 17, 2018. 

On September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company used a binomial lattice pricing model to determine the fair value of the derivative liability
of the warrants on that date and determined the fair value was $0 and $21, respectively. The Company recorded the change in the
fair value of the derivative liability for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as a gain of $11 and $41, respectively,
and a gain of $21 and $117 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The
fair value of the warrant derivative liability as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was calculated using a binomial

Forward
Investments, LLC Convertible Feature   

On
February 4, 2014 and March 28, 2014, Forward Investments, LLC made convertible loans to the Company for working capital purposes
in the amounts of $1,800 and $1,200, respectively. Such loans are evidenced by convertible promissory notes that bear interest
at the rate of 2% and 10% per annum, were to mature on June 30, 2015 and originally were convertible into shares of the Company s
common stock at an initial conversion price of $6.36 per share.  

The
fair value of the embedded conversion feature at the date of issuance was $8,860. The Company recorded a debt discount of $6,475
and a loss on debt discount of $2,385. The debt discount is being amortized over the life of the loans. The Company used a Monte
Carlo simulation on the date of issuance to determine the fair value of the embedded conversion feature.  

On October 22, 2014, the
two convertible promissory notes were modified to reduce the initial conversion price of $6.36 to $3.93. As a result, the Company
used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value on the date of modification. The Company recorded the change in the fair
value of the derivative liability as a loss on fair value of derivative instruments of $310. 

On March 4, 2015, the Company
and Forward Investments, LLC restructured the two promissory notes in order to extend the maturity dates thereof, reduce the seniority
and reduce the interest rate accruing thereon (refer to Note 12, Related Parties, for further detail). The Company accounted for
this restructuring of the promissory notes as a debt modification under ASC Topic 470-50. As part of the modification, the Company
analyzed the embedded conversion feature and recorded a loss on fair value of derivative instruments of $2,600 on the unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

In conjunction with the issuance of the 6.5% and 3% convertible notes issued to Forward Investments, LLC on
March 4, 2015, the Company recorded an additional derivative liability as a debt discount in the amount of $260 and $1,970, respectively,
on the date of the issuance of the notes. 

The
debt discounts are being amortized over the life of the loans. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of issuance
to determine the fair value of the embedded conversion features.  

On
August 3, 2015, the Company and Forward Investments, LLC agreed to reset the conversion price of the convertible notes to $1.58
per share of the Company s common stock. As a result, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair value
of the conversion features on the date of the agreement. On the date of the transaction, the fair value of the Forward Investments
convertible notes conversion feature did not change and as such, no change in fair value of derivative instruments was recorded
on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.  

On October 26, 2015, the
ratchet-down feature within the original agreement was triggered and the conversion price of the convertible notes was reset to
$1.25 per share of the Company s common stock. Prior to the triggering of the ratchet-down feature, the Company revalued
the derivative and recorded a gain on fair value of derivative liabilities of $120 on the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company then reduced the existing derivative liability related to the reset provision and recorded the change of $2,310 in
the derivative liability value as a loss on change in fair value of derivative instruments on the consolidated statement of operations.

JGB
(Cayman) Concord Ltd. Senior Secured Convertible Note   

On
February 17, 2016, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement by and among the Company, VaultLogix, and JGB Concord,
whereby the Company exchanged the White Oak Global Advisors, LLC promissory note and subsequently assigned to the lender party
a new 8.25% senior secured convertible note dated February 18, 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $11,601 (refer to Note
7, Term Loans, for further details).  

The
Company evaluated the senior secured convertible note s settlement provisions and determined that the conversion feature
and fundamental transaction clauses met the criteria to be classified as embedded derivatives as set forth in ASC 815,  Derivatives
and Hedging  and ASC 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . On February 18, 2016, the Company used a
Monte Carlo simulation to value the settlement features and ascribed a value of $1,350 related to the conversion feature and fundamental
transaction clauses and recorded these items on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as a derivative liability.
The debt discounts are being amortized over the life of the loan.  

On May 17, 2016, the Company
entered into the Note Forbearance Agreement with JGB Concord pursuant to which JGB Concord agreed to forbear action with respect
to certain existing defaults in accordance with the terms of the Note Forbearance Agreement (Refer to Note 7, Term Loans, for
further details). The Company evaluated the Note Forbearance Agreement and accounted for the transaction as a debt extinguishment
in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50. In accordance with ASC Topic 470-50, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to revalue
the settlement features associated with the Note Forbearance Agreement. The Company recorded the change in the settlement features
as a loss to change in fair value of derivative instruments of $2,196 to its consolidated statement of operations on May 17, 2016. 

On May 23, 2016, the Company
entered into the Amended Agreement with JGB Concord, JGB Waltham, White Oak Global Advisors, LLC, VaultLogix, and the Guarantors.
The Company accounted for this Amended Agreement in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50. In accordance with ASC Topic 470-50, the
Company accounted for the Amended Agreement as a debt modification and utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair
value of the settlement features. The Company recorded a loss on the fair value of the settlement features to change in fair value
of derivative instruments of $79 on the consolidated statement of operations as of May 23, 2016. 

On June 23, 2016, the Company entered into an amended agreement with JGB Concord and JGB Waltham (refer to
Note 7, Term Loans, for further detail). The Company accounted for the amended agreement as a debt extinguishment in accordance
with ASC Topic 470-50. In accordance with ASC Topic 470-50, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to revalue the settlement
features associated with the Amended Agreement to determine the fair value. The Company recorded the change in the settlement features
as a loss to change in fair value of derivative instruments of $924 to its consolidated statement of operations on June 23, 2016. 

As
part of the June 23, 2016 amended agreement with JGB Concord, the Company issued 900,000 shares of the Company s common
stock on June 23, 2016 to JGB Concord (Refer to Note 10, Stockholders  Deficit, for further detail), which includes a make-whole
provision whereby the Company will pay JGB Concord in cash the difference between $0.94 per share of the Company s common
stock and the average volume weighted average price per share of the Company s common stock sixty days after shares of the
Company s common stock are freely tradable. The Company accounted for the make-whole provision within the June 23, 2016
amendment agreement as a derivative liability and utilized a binomial lattice model to ascribe a value of $280, which was recorded
as a derivative liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the Company s
consolidated statement of operations on June 23, 2016.  

On September 1, 2016, the Company
entered into an amended agreement with JGB Concord and JGB Waltham (refer to Note 7, Term Loans, for further detail). The Company
accounted for the amended agreement as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50. In accordance with ASC Topic
470-50, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to revalue the settlement features associated with the Amended Agreement. The
Company recorded the change in the settlement features as a gain to change in fair value of derivative instruments of $1,308 to
its consolidated statement of operations on September 1, 2016. 

On September 30, 2016, the Company
used a Monte Carlo simulation to value the settlement features of the senior secured convertible notes and determined the fair
value to be $1,082 and recorded the change in fair value of derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 as a gain of $1,919 and a loss of $288, respectively, which includes all extinguishment and conversion accounting for
the periods in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50. These changes were recorded in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations.

Net
Settlement of Accounts Payable   

On March 25, 2015, the
Company issued 300,000 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 80,000 shares of common stock to a third-party vendor
to settle various accounts payable. The shares of common stock were issued with a six-month restrictive legend and as such, the
fair value of the accounts payable to be paid with the common stock had not been determined. The Company recorded the common stock
at a fair value of $648 and the warrant with a fair value of $106, which reduced the accounts payable to the third party in the
amount of $1,475. The Company recorded a derivative liability of $721 at the time the shares were issued. The Company used a Black-Scholes
pricing model to determine the fair value of the warrant on the date it was issued. 

On
April 1, 2015, the Company cancelled the warrants to purchase 80,000 shares of common stock issued to the third party and the
third party returned the 300,000 shares of common stock previously issued on March 25, 2015 to treasury stock. The Company then
issued a new one-year warrant for 425,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.55 per share. The Company recorded
the warrant with a fair value of $674, which reduced the accounts payable to the third party in the amount of $1,417. The Company
recorded a derivative liability of $743 at the time the warrants were issued. The derivative liability relates to the difference
between the accounts payable due to the third party and the fair value of the warrants on April 1, 2015. The Company used a Black-Scholes
pricing model, which is not materially different from a binomial lattice valuation methodology, to determine the fair value of
the warrant on the date it was issued.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company revalued the accounts payable derivative and recorded a gain on fair value of
derivative instruments of $379 and $179 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, on the unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations.  

Beginning
on October 9, 2015 and continuing through November 12, 2015, the third-party began exercising the warrants to purchase shares
of the Company s common stock. During this time, the third-party exercised all of the 425,000 warrants issued on April 1,
2015 to purchase 287,001 shares of the Company s common stock. The third-party applied the proceeds from the warrant exercise
to reduce outstanding accounts payable of $452. The Company recorded a reduction in accounts payable of $452, a reduction in the
derivative balance of $743, and recorded a loss on fair value of derivative of $30. As of November 12, 2015, there are no remaining
warrants issued for settlement of accounts payable or any related derivative liabilities.  

On September 8, 2016,
the Company issued a warrant to purchase up to a total of 2,500,000 shares of common stock at any time on or prior to April 1,
2017. The exercise price of the warrant is $0.001. The warrant was issued in consideration for the outstanding accounts payable
to the holder of the warrant. Based on the agreement, the proceeds from the eventual sale of the common stock based on the exercise
of all or a portion of the warrant will be applied towards unpaid invoices for services previously rendered to the Company. The
Company determined that the fair value of the warrants was $460, which is included in common stock warrants within the stockholders 
deficit section on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.

INCOME TAXES   

As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards ( NOL s ) of approximately $105,964 and
$64,489, respectively, state NOL s of approximately $106,576, and $60,617, respectively, and foreign NOL s of approximately
$490 and $490, respectively, that will be available to reduce future taxable income, if any. These NOL s begin to expire
in 2025. In addition, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had federal tax credit carry forwards of $690
and 690, respectively, available to reduce future taxes. These credits begin to expire in 2022. 

Sections 382 and 383 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards
if the Company were to undergo an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs
whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by 5-percent shareholders, as defined in
Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned,
directly or indirectly, by such 5-percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years. In the event such ownership
change occurs, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses prior to full utilization. The Company
has completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes
since the Company became a  loss corporation  under the Code. As disclosed, the Company has taken these limitations
into account in determining its available NOL s. 

During 2012, the Company
acquired ownership of three entities that had historically used the cash method of accounting for tax purposes. Section 446 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, requires that the Company prepare its tax returns using the accrual method of accounting.
As a result of this change from cash to accrual accounting for income tax purposes, the Company recognized $1,193 of income during
2015.  

During 2012 and 2013, the
Company acquired 100% of a Puerto Rican limited liability company, thereby subjecting the Company to Puerto Rico income taxes on
any Puerto Rico-sourced taxable income. Such taxes paid are considered foreign taxes that may be credited against federal income
taxes payable in future years. 

The Company s 2013 U.S. corporation
income tax return is currently under examination. During the third quarter of 2016, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed a
deduction for 2013 for stock-based compensation of $1,573, related to shares of common stock issued but not vested during 2013.
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has questioned the Company s classification of certain individuals as independent
contractors rather than employees. The Company estimates its potential liability to be less than $100, but the liability, if any,
upon final disposition of these matters is uncertain.

Restructuring
of Forward Investments, LLC Promissory Notes and Working Capital Loan   

On
March 4, 2015, the Company restructured the terms of certain promissory notes issued by it to a related party investor, Forward
Investments, LLC, in order to extend the maturity dates thereof, reduce the seniority and reduce the interest rate accruing thereon.
The following notes were restructured as follows:  

notes
    issued to Forward Investments, LLC in the principal amount of $2,825 that bear interest at the rate of 2% per annum, had the
    maturity date extended from June 30, 2015 to July 1, 2016; and   

notes
    issued to Forward Investments, LLC in the aggregate principal amount of $2,645 were converted from senior notes to junior
    notes, had the interest rate reduced from 18% to 3% per annum, had the maturity date extended by approximately three years
    to January 1, 2018, and originally were convertible at a conversion price of $6.36 per share until the Convertible Debentures
    were repaid in full and thereafter $2.35 per share, subject to further adjustment as set forth therein.   

In
connection with such restructuring, Forward Investments, LLC agreed to lend to the Company an amount substantially similar to
the accrued interest the Company owed to Forward Investments, LLC on the restructured notes. In consideration for such restructuring
and additional payments made by Forward Investments, LLC to the Company, the Company issued to Forward Investments, LLC an additional
convertible note in the original principal amount of $1,730 with an interest rate of 3% per annum, a maturity date of January
1, 2018, and an initial conversion price of $6.36 per share until the Convertible Debentures were repaid in full and thereafter
$2.35 per share, subject to further adjustment as set forth therein, and provided Forward Investments, LLC the option to lend
the Company an additional $8,000 in the form of convertible notes similar to the existing convertible notes of the Company issued
to Forward Investments, LLC. The convertible note was issued to Forward Investments, LLC as an incentive to restructure the above-mentioned
notes and resulted in the Company recording a loss on modification of debt of $1,508 on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations as of March 31, 2015.  

As
part of the restructuring, Forward Investments, LLC agreed to convert $390 of accrued interest on the above-mentioned loans to
a new note bearing interest at the rate of 6.5% per annum that matures on July 1, 2016.  

In conjunction with the
extension of the 2% and 10% convertible notes issued to Forward Investments, LLC, the Company recorded an additional $1,916 of
debt discount at the date of the restructuring. 

The Company has entered
into an agreement with Forward Investments, LLC permitting Forward Investments, LLC to convert its debt into the Company s
common stock at the daily market price. During the period from July 7, 2016 to September 30, 2016, Forward Investments, LLC converted
$1,462 aggregate principal amount of promissory notes into an aggregate of 5,684,578 shares of the Company s common stock.

bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum, originally matured on January 1, 2015 and is convertible into shares of the Company s

SEGMENTS   

The
Company operates in three reportable segments: applications and infrastructure, professional services, and managed services. The
Company identified its operating segments based on the services provided by its various operations and the financial information
used by its chief operating decision maker to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to and the financial performance
of the operating segments. The reporting segments represent an aggregation of individual operating segments with similar economic
characteristics. The applications and infrastructure operating segment is an aggregation of the component operations of TNS, the
AWS Entities, Tropical, RM Leasing, and RM Engineering. The professional services operating segment is an aggregation of the operations
of the ADEX Entities and SDN. The managed services operating segment is comprised of the operations of IPC, RentVM and Nottingham.  

In
addition to the operating segments, the Company has determined that certain costs related to the general operations of the Company
cannot be reasonably allocated to each individual segment. These costs are not part of the factors that the chief operating decision
maker uses to calculate gross margin. As such, the Company has chosen to present those costs within a general  Corporate 
line item for presentation purposes. The Company s former VaultLogix and Axim subsidiaries, which we included in the Company s
cloud services segment, were reclassified as  discontinued operations  to conform to classifications used in the current
period related to the sale of VaultLogix, VaultLogix s subsidiaries and Axim.

Overview   

We
operate in three reportable segments: applications and infrastructure, professional services, and managed services. The applications
and infrastructure operating segment is an aggregation of the component operations of RM Leasing, TNS and the AWS Entities. On
January 1, 2015, we merged the operations of Tropical into the operations of AWS. The professional services operating segment
is an aggregation of the operations of the ADEX Entities and SDN. The managed services operating segment is primarily comprised
of the operations of IPC. On January 1, 2015, we merged the operations of RentVM with the operations of IPC.  

On February 17, 2016,
we sold certain assets of our formerly-owned VaultLogix and subsidiaries reporting unit, which was included in our former cloud
services segment. On April 29, 2016, we sold our formerly-owned Axim subsidiary, which also was included in our former cloud services
segment. The operations of VaultLogix and its subsidiaries as well as Axim have been excluded from the comparative tables noted
below and are included within the line item  net income (loss) on discontinued operations  within our unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of operations. 

Results
of Continuing Operations   Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues:   

Revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $1.9 million, or 11%, to $19.6 million, as compared to $17.6 million for the corresponding
period in 2015. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from an increase in our professional services segment due to two new
projects at our retail customers. Additionally, this increased revenue was offset by decreases in our applications and infrastructure
segment and our managed services segment. The decrease in our applications and infrastructure segment resulted from contracts
not completed as of September 30, 2016. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, 52% of our revenue was derived from our professional services segment, 27% from our
managed services segment, and 21% from our applications and infrastructure segment. During the three months ended September 30,
2015, 37% of our revenue was derived from our professional services segment, 31% from our managed services segment, and 32% from
our applications and infrastructure. Revenues from our managed services segment tends to be recurring in nature. Such recurring
revenue was $2.9 million and $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

45  

Cost
of revenue and gross margin:   

Cost
of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily consisted of direct labor provided by employees, services
provided by subcontractors, direct material and other related costs. For a majority of the contract services we perform, our customers
provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel, tools and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance
services. The increase in cost of revenue of $1.2 million, or 9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily
attributable increase in cost of revenue in our professional services segment. This increase is directly related to the increase
in revenue resulting from the two projects at our retail customers referred to above. Costs of revenue as a percentage of revenues
was 71% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 72% for the same period in 2015.  

Our
gross profit percentage was 29% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 28% for the comparable period in
2015. The overall increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to higher margins realized on jobs within our professional
services segment.  

Salaries
and wages:   

For
the three months period ended September 30, 2016, salaries and wages increased $1.1 million to $5.1 million as compared to
approximately $4.0 million for the same period in 2015. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and
wages in our professional services segment, which resulted from an increase in business activity. Salaries and wages were 26%
of revenue in the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 23% for the same period in 2015. Our salaries
and wages did not increase proportionally to an increase in our revenue.   

46  

General
and Administrative:   

General
and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs, as well as the costs of our subsidiaries  management personnel
and administrative overhead. These costs consist of office rental, legal, consulting and professional fees, travel costs and other
costs that are not directly related to the performance of our services under customer contracts. General and administrative expenses
increased approximately $0.6 million, or 17%, to $3.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3.2
million in the comparable period of 2015. This increase primarily resulted from increases in consulting expense in our managed
services segment. Consulting expense increased $0.3 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
General and administrative expenses increased to 19% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016, from 18% in the
comparable period in 2015.  

Interest
Expense:   

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The increase in
interest expense primarily resulted from the additional debt incurred during 2016.  

Net
Income Attributable to our Common Stockholders:   

Net income attributable
to our common stockholders was $2.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net loss attributable to
common stockholders of $(2.9) million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net income was primarily
due to an increase in the change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $11.2 million. Additionally, gross profit increased
$0.7 million. This increase was offset by an increase in salaries and wages expense of $1.1 million and an increase in the loss
on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million.    

Results
of Continuing Operations   Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues:   

Revenues for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $4.4 million, or 8%, to $59.8 million, as compared to $55.4 million for the corresponding
period in 2015. The increase in revenues resulted primarily from an increase in our professional services segment due to a one-time
event at a large telecommunications carrier and two projects at our retail customers. Additionally, this increased revenue was
offset by a decrease in revenue from our managed services segment, which resulted from certain one-time projects completed in
2015. 

47  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 47% of our revenue was derived from our professional services segment, 26% from our
managed services segment, and 27% from our applications and infrastructure segment. During the nine months ended September 30,
2015, 35% of our revenue was derived from our professional services segment, 38% from our managed services segment, and 27% from
our applications and infrastructure segment. Revenues from our managed services segment tends to be recurring in nature. Such
recurring revenue was $8.2 million and $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Cost
of revenue and gross margin:    

Cost
of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily consisted of direct labor provided by employees, services
provided by subcontractors, direct material and other related costs. For a majority of the contract services we perform, our customers
provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel, tools and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance
services. The increase in cost of revenue of $3.4 million, or 8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable
to an increase in cost of revenue in our professional services and application and infrastructure segments. This increase in cost
of goods sold from our professional services segment is directly related to the increase in revenue resulting from a one-time
event at a large telecommunications carrier and the two projects at our retail customers referred to above. The increase in cost
of goods sold related to our applications and infrastructure segment resulted from declining gross margins during this period.
Costs of revenue as a percentage of revenues was 74% for the both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Our
gross profit percentage was 26% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in gross profit percentage
from our professional services and managed services segments was offset by a decrease in our managed services segment.  

Salaries
and wages:   

48  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, salaries and wages decreased $4.0 million to $13.4 million as compared to approximately
$17.4 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in salaries and wages in our corporate
segment, which resulted from a decrease in stock compensation expense of $5.0 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was offset by increased salary and wages expense in our professional services
segment. Salaries and wages were 22% of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 31% for the same period
in 2015. Our salaries and wages will not increase proportionally to an increase in our revenue.  

General
and Administrative:   

General
and administrative costs include all of our corporate costs, as well as the costs of our subsidiaries  management personnel
and administrative overhead. These costs consist of office rental, legal, consulting and professional fees, travel costs and other
costs that are not directly related to the performance of our services under customer contracts. General and administrative expenses
increased approximately $3.3 million, or 39%, to $11.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.5
million in the comparable period of 2015. This increase primarily resulted from increases in accounting and legal expense primarily
resulting from changing independent auditors. Accounting and legal expense increased $1.6 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Additionally, marketing development funds decreased by $0.8 million during
this period in 2016. Marketing development funds offset general and administrative expense. As a result, general and administrative
expense increased by this amount. General and administrative expenses increased to 20% of revenues during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, from 15% in the comparable period in 2015.  

Interest
Expense:   

Interest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense
primarily resulted from the additional debt incurred during 2016. 

Net
Loss Attributable to our Common Stockholders.   

Net loss attributable
to our common stockholders was $15.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net loss attributable to
common stockholders of $27.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was primarily due
to an increase in the gain in the fair value of derivative instruments of $15.3 million, a reduction in salaries and wages expense
of $4.0 million and an increase in gross profit of $1.0 million. This reduction in the net loss was offset by an increase in interest
expense of $4.0 million and an increase in SG A expense of $3.3 million. Additionally, offsetting the decrease, the losses
on conversion, extinguishment and modification of debt had a net increase of $2.6 million. 

49  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We believe that our available
cash balance as of the date of this filing will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the
next twelve months. The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm s Report issued in connection with our audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 stated that there is  substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern . Management believes that our ability to continue our operations depends on our ability to
sustain and grow revenue and results of operations as well as our ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish
our strategic objectives. Management believes that we will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated gross profits but were unable to achieve positive cash flow from operations.
We expect to finance our cash needs from our operations and, depending on our results of operations, we may need to complete additional
equity or debt financings or to sell additional assets or businesses until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows
from operating activities, if ever. 

At September 30, 2016, we
had a working capital deficit of $19.9 million, as compared to a working capital deficit of $11.4 million at December 31, 2015. 

Our future capital requirements
for our operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of our businesses, the number and cash requirements
of other acquisition candidates that we pursue, and the costs of our operations. Our management has taken several actions to ensure
that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations through September 30, 2017, including the reduction of certain general
and administrative expenses, consulting expenses and other professional services fees. Additionally, if our actual revenues are
less than forecasted, we anticipate implementing headcount reductions to a level that more appropriately matches then-current revenue
and expense levels. We also are evaluating other measures to further improve our liquidity, including, the sale of certain operating
assets or businesses, the sale of equity or debt securities and entering into joint ventures with third parties. Lastly, we may
elect to reduce certain related-party and third-party debt by converting such debt into common or preferred shares. We are currently
in discussions with a third party on a credit facility to enhance our liquidity position. Our management believes that these actions
will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements through September 30, 2017. There is no assurance that we will be successful
in any capital-raising efforts that we may undertake to fund operations during 2016 and 2017. 

Over the long-term, we plan
to generate positive cash flow from our subsidiaries. However, as discussed above, to execute our business plan, service our existing
indebtedness and implement our business strategy, we will need to obtain additional financing from time to time and may choose
to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, borrowings from affiliates
or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us or
at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current
stockholders  ownership and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The terms of those securities
issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors and may include the issuance of warrants or
other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. We also may be required to recognize non-cash expenses in
connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
Furthermore, any debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form. 

We had capital expenditures
of $0.02 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect our capital expenditures for the 12 months
ending September 30, 2017 to be consistent with our prior spending. These capital expenditures will be primarily utilized for equipment
needed to generate revenue and for office equipment. We expect to fund such capital expenditures out of our working capital. 

The following summary of
our cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our historical consolidated financial statements, which are included
elsewhere in this report: 

Summary
of Cash Flows  

50  

Net cash used in operating activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12.5 million, which included $2.4 million in stock compensation charges, gains
on the fair value of derivative liabilities of $16.0 million, losses on the conversion of debt of $9.4 million and changes in accounts
receivable, inventory, other assets, deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.5 million. 

Net cash provided by investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $20.8 million. This consisted primarily of the net cash provided by the investing
activities of discontinued operations in regards to the disposal of our former VaultLogix subsidiary. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This
consisted of repayments of bank borrowings and term loans.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,
our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing
disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation
and the material weaknesses described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our SEC
reports (i) is not recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii)
is not accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses relate to our inability to timely file our reports
and other information with the SEC as required under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, together with material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting. Our management also has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over
financial reporting relating to (i) our failure to effectively implement comprehensive entity-level internal controls, (ii) our
lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience in the application of U.S.
GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and, (iii) our lack of the quantity of resources necessary to implement
an appropriate level of review controls to properly evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the transactions into which we enter.
Our management believes that these weaknesses are due in part to the small size of our staff, which makes it challenging to maintain
adequate disclosure controls. To remediate the material weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures during 2016 we hired
a third-party firm to assess, document and test our internal controls over financial reporting. We plan to hire additional experienced
accounting and other personnel to assist with filings and financial record keeping and to take additional steps to improve our
financial reporting systems and implement new policies, procedures and controls.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

The
disposal of our former Axim subsidiary, which was the remaining cloud services segment component, constitutes a change in internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months covered by this report that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

There have been no material
developments in any of the legal proceedings discussed in Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 or Item 1 of Part II of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, except as described
below. 

IPC-Related Litigation.   As
reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in January 2015, a complaint was filed in the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York against our company, Mark Munro, our Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer, and Daniel J. Sullivan, our Chief Accounting Officer and former Chief Financial Officer. The complaint
alleged, among other claims, our breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment
relating to our purported failure to pay certain post-closing purchase price payments to the sellers of our subsidiary, Integration
Partners   NY Corporation ( IPC ), in connection with our purchase of IPC in January 2014. The complaint also
alleged that Messrs. Munro and Sullivan intentionally interfered with such contractual obligations of our company under the related
stock purchase agreement between our company and the plaintiffs. The complaint sought unspecified damages, attorney and expert
fees and other unspecified litigation costs. In addition, the complaint sought specific performance of the enforcement of the
terms of the purchase contract and our payment of not less than $2.5 million. 

On October 6, 2016, we and the
other defendants entered into a settlement agreement and release dated as of October 6, 2016 with the plaintiffs in which we agreed,
among other things and without admitting or conceding the truth of any of the allegations or claims in such legal proceeding,
to settle all claims that were asserted, or could have been asserted, in such proceeding by releasing to the plaintiffs approximately
$951,000 that was then being held in an escrow account established pursuant to the purchase agreement and agreeing to pay to the
plaintiffs on or prior to December 5, 2016, an additional payment of approximately $349,000.  Upon payment of such amounts,
plaintiffs are required to file with the court a stipulation of dismissal of such proceeding with prejudice. 

Farkas Group
Litigation.    In July 2013, a complaint was filed against our company in the Circuit Court of the 15 th 
Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida titled  The Farkas Group, Inc., The Atlas Group of Companies, LLC and
Michael D. Farkas v. InterCloud Systems, Inc.  (Case No. 502013CA01133XXXMB) for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. 
In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that we have breached contractual agreements between our company and plaintiffs pertaining
to certain indebtedness amounting to approximately $116,000 allegedly owed by us to the plaintiffs and our agreement to convert
such indebtedness into shares of our common stock.  We have asserted as a defense that such indebtedness, together with any
right to convert such indebtedness into shares of common stock, was cancelled pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated as of July 2, 2009 between our company and the plaintiffs. The Farkas Group was a control person of our company during the
period that it was a public  shell  company and facilitated the transfer of control of our company to our former chief
executive officer, Gideon Taylor.  This matter is presently set on the court s non-jury trial docket.  We intend
to continue to vigorously defend this lawsuit.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item
1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect
our business, financial condition, or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks
we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we issued securities in the following transactions, each of which was exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Except for the shares of our common stock that were issued upon the conversion of our convertible
debt securities or the grants of shares of common stock under our 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, all of the below-referenced
securities were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and are deemed to
be restricted securities for purposes of the Securities Act. There were no underwriters or placement agents employed in connection
with any of these transactions. Use of the exemption provided in Section 4(2) for transactions not involving a public offering
is based on the following facts:  

Neither
    we nor any person acting on our behalf solicited any offer to buy or sell securities by any form of general solicitation or
    advertising.   

The
    recipients were either accredited or otherwise sophisticated individuals who had such knowledge and experience in business
    matters that they were capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in our securities.   

The
    recipients had access to business and financial information concerning our company.   

All
    securities issued were issued with a restrictive legend and may only be disposed of pursuant to an effective registration
    or exemption from registration in compliance with federal and state securities laws.   

The
shares of our common stock that were issued upon the conversion of our convertible debt securities were issued pursuant to the
exemption from registration under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and are deemed to be restricted securities for purposes
of the Securities Act.  

52  

The
shares of our common stock that were granted to employees under our 2012 Performance Incentive Plan were issued pursuant to the
exemption from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Rule 701 of the Securities Act as offers and sales of securities
under compensatory benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation in compliance with Rule 701. Each of the recipients of
securities in any transaction exempt from registration either received or had adequate access, through employment, business or
other relationships, to information about us.
