    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1        DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

Vystar Corporation ( Vystar , the
 Company ,  we ,  us , or  our ) is the creator and exclusive owner of the innovative
technology to produce Vytex  Natural Rubber Latex ( NRL ) and is focused on expanding the licensing and utilization
of its proprietary source natural rubber latex technology. 

Vystar has expanded into the consumer arena
with an introduction into the mattress, mattress topper and pillow arenas aligning with key foam manufacturers, mattress, mattress
toppers and pillow producers, and furniture stores in specific areas of the Unites States. On January 22, 2015, Vystar announced
the signing of an exclusive domestic distribution agreement with Worcester, MA based Nature s Home Solutions (NHS) who sources
eco-friendly materials and technologies for use in furnishings and other markets. Vystar has also completed several trials with
Vietnamese, European and Indian makers of foam products to use its Vytex NRL raw material in their current offerings in their own
areas as well as to supply added needs for foam cores in both the mattress and topper arenas. The current requests from major mattress
manufactures trialing Vytex foam products involves different densities especially those used on the upper levels of mattresses.
The samples have been presented to the manufacturers and feedback has been very positive. A similar trial occurred in October 2016
in Thailand focusing on specific densities and pillows, and a meeting with a Belgian foam maker using a unique drying concept occurred
in May 2016 with discussions ongoing. In addition, working with NHS and a large Vietnamese foam manufacturer, Lien A, the group
attended the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA) in Orlando in March 2016. The significance of ISPA is the focus on
components for use with major mattress and pillow manufacturers, which takes Vytex foam to an additional audience. 

NOTE 2        BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America ( GAAP )
for interim financial information.  Accordingly, certain information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial
statements may be condensed or omitted.  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In the opinion of Vystar management, these financial
statements contain all adjustments (which comprise only normal and recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial
position and results of operations as of and for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying disclosures.  Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and
actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from these estimates. Examples include valuation allowances
for deferred tax assets, provisions for bad debts, and fair values of share-based compensation. 

Concentration of Credit Risk  

Certain financial instruments potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk.  These financial instruments consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. 
Cash held in banks in many cases exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insurance limits.  While we monitor
our cash balances on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the underlying
financial institutions fail.  To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash; however, we can provide
no assurances that access to our cash will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. 

Loss Per Share  

Because the Company reported a net loss for
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, common stock equivalents, including stock options and warrants, were
anti-dilutive; therefore, the amounts reported for basic and diluted loss per share were the same.  Excluded from the
computation of diluted loss per share were options outstanding to purchase 9,718,271 shares and 8,444,906 shares of common stock
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  Warrants
to purchase 18,084,609 shares and 19,688,370 shares of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
were also excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

Revenues  

Vystar derives revenue from license fees of
Vytex NRL raw material to manufacturers and distributors of rubber and rubber-end products such as the foam used in the pillows
and mattresses. Revenue is recognized when the licensee confirms payment and pays Vystar. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company s financial instruments consist
of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, line of credit and shareholder notes payable.  The carrying
values of all the Company s financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short maturities. In addition to
the short maturities, the carrying amounts of our line of credit and shareholder notes payable approximate fair value because the
interest rates at September 30, 2016 approximate market interest rates for the respective borrowings. 

In specific circumstances, certain assets and
liabilities are reported or disclosed at fair value.  Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the Company's
principal market for such transactions.  If there is not an established principal market, fair value is derived from the most
advantageous market. 

Valuation inputs are classified in the following
hierarchy: 

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable valuation inputs for the asset or liability, excluding Level 1 inputs. 

 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 

Highest priority is given to Level 1 inputs
and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.  Acceptable valuation techniques include the market approach, income approach,
and cost approach.  In some cases, more than one valuation technique is used. 

NOTE 3        LIQUIDITY
AND GOING CONCERN  

The Company's financial statements are prepared
using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with GAAP and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.  However, the Company has incurred
significant losses and experienced negative cash flow since its inception.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of
$117,640 and a deficit in working capital of $2,147,866.  Further, at September 30, 2016, the accumulated deficit amounted
to $26,579,827.  As a result of the Company's history of losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

A successful transition to attaining profitable
operations is dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Company s planned expenses and achieving a level
of revenue adequate to support the Company s cost structure. Management plans to finance future operations through the use
of cash on hand, increased revenue from Vytex division license fees, our credit facility, stock warrant exercises from existing
shareholders, raising capital through private placements of capital stock and debt. 

The Company s future expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including: the rate at which the Company can introduce and license Vytex NRL to manufacturers; the
costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; market acceptance
of the Company s products and services; and competing technological developments. As the Company expands its activities and
operations, cash requirements are expected to increase at a rate consistent with revenue growth after the Company has achieved
sustained revenue generation. 

There can be no assurances that the Company
will be able to achieve its projected level of revenue in 2016 and beyond. If the Company is unable to achieve its projected revenue
and is not able to obtain alternate additional financing of equity or debt, the Company would need to significantly reorient its
operations during 2017, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its business objectives
and as a result may require the Company to file for bankruptcy or cease operations. The financial  s tatements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts classified
as liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be forced to take any such actions. 

NOTE 4        DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

As part of the Company s strategy to
focus on realizing the potential of the Vytex foam business in the pillow and mattress markets as well as part of the Company s
cost reduction plan, the Company made the decision in May 2016 to discontinue the operations of the Kiron division acquired in
June 2013. 

The Kiron division revenue was $4,538 and $77,045
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and $80,988 and $276,306 for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gains (Losses) from discontinued operations were ($31,030) and ($7,160) for the
three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $43,207 and ($64,741) for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5        PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment consists of the following: 

Depreciation expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $368, respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $278 and $1,330, respectively. 

The Company disposed of all of the Kiron Division s equipment
and leasehold improvements resulting in a net $2,701 of proceeds. 

NOTE 6        INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

Patents represent legal and other fees associated
with the registration of patents.  The Company has four patents with the United States Patent and Trade Office (USPTO),
as well as many international PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patents. 

Intangible assets are as
follows: 

Amortization expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,920. Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $11,760. 

NOTE 7        INCOME TAXES  

There is no income tax benefit recorded for
the losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 since management has determined that the realization
of the net deferred tax asset is not assured and has created a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the net deferred tax
asset. 

NOTE 8        NOTES
PAYABLE AND LOAN FACILITY  

Related Party Line of Credit (CMA Note Payable)  

On April 29, 2011, the Company executed with
CMA Investments, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ( CMA ), a line of credit with a principal amount of up to
$800,000 (the  CMA Note ). CMA is a limited liability company of which three of the directors of the Company ( CMA
directors ) were initially the members. Pursuant to the terms of the CMA Note, the Company may draw up to a maximum principal
amount of $800,000. Interest, is computed at LIBOR plus 5.25% (5.8125% at September 30, 2016), on amounts drawn and fees. The weighted
average interest rate in effect on the borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 5.72%. 

Other terms of the CMA Note include: 

The Note is unsecured; 

 No payments of principal are due until the second anniversary of the Note, at which
time all outstanding principal is due and payable; and 

 As compensation to the directors for providing the Note, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 2,600,000 shares of the Company s common stock to the CMA Directors at $0.45 per share, which was the closing
price of the Company s stock on April 29, 2011, which vest 20% immediately and 10% upon each draw by the Company of $100,000
under the Note. Because the warrants were issued and valued prior to the receipt of funds under this loan, no discount could be
recorded and, accordingly, the value of the warrants was capitalized as a financing cost. The costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the term of the Note. 

On September 14, 2011, the Company s
Board of Directors approved increasing the line of credit with CMA by $200,000 to a maximum principal amount of $1,000,000 and
the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer became a member of CMA. As compensation to the CMA Directors for increasing
the amount available under the CMA Note, the Board of Directors approved modifying the exercise price for the 2,600,000 compensatory
stock purchase warrants previously issued to the Directors from $0.45 to $0.27 per share, which was the closing price of the Company s
common stock on that date and the Company also issued warrants to purchase an additional 1,600,000 shares of the Company s
stock at $0.27 per share, which was the closing price of the Company s common stock on September 14, 2011, which vest upon
the original terms of the CMA Note. The costs incurred in the modification of the exercise price of the 2,600,000 compensatory
stock purchase warrants issued on April 29, 2011 and the additional 1,600,000 warrants issued on September 14, 2011 are being amortized
on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the CMA Note. 

On November 2, 2012, the Board of Directors
approved an increase in the CMA line of credit from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. As compensation to the CMA Directors for increasing
the amount available under the CMA Note, warrants to purchase an additional 2,100,000 shares of the Company s stock at $0.35
per share were issued and recorded as deferred financing cost to be amortized through interest expense over the remaining term
of the CMA Note. There was no amortization of the financing costs associated with the CMA Note for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

On April 29, 2013, the maturity date of the
CMA Note was extended to April 29, 2014. As compensation to the CMA Directors for extending the maturity date of the CMA Note,
the Board of Directors approved modifying the exercise price for the 6,300,000 compensatory stock purchase warrants previously
issued to the Directors to $0.10 per share and the CMA Directors forfeited 630,000 of the warrants. Amortization of the financing
costs associated with extending the CMA Note was amortized through interest expense. 

On April 30, 2014 the maturity date of the
CMA Note was extended to April 30, 2015. No consideration was awarded the CMA members based on this extension. 

On April 29, 2015 the maturity date of the
CMA Note was extended to April 29, 2016. No consideration was awarded the CMA members based on this extension. 

On April 29, 2016, the maturity date for the
CMA Note has been extended to April 29, 2017. No consideration was awarded to the CMA members based on this extension. 

Shareholder Notes Payable  

The following table
summarizes the shareholder notes payable: 

Such notes are (i) unsecured, (ii) bear
interest at an annual rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, and (iii) are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion
rate ranging between $0.05 and $0.10 of principal and interest for each such share. 

 The current average conversion price
for the above referenced Shareholder and Promissory Notes with an outstanding balance as of September 30, 2016 of $966,288 including
accrued interest, is approximately $0.055 per share or 17,441,891 shares of the Company s common stock. The face value of
the Shareholder Notes at September 30, 2016 is $700,068. 

 On August 15, 2016, the Company received
notice from the holder of a Shareholder Promissory Note ( Note ) with a face value of $100,000 that the Company was
in default under the terms of the Note and was calling for the principal and accrued interest be paid. The outstanding balance
due under the Note as of September 30, 2016 was $154,986. The Company has agreed to terms that pay off the Note over a period of
time extending in to 2017.

of $2,000,000. The preferred stock accumulates a 10% per annum dividend and was convertible at a conversion price of $0.075 per
common share at the option of the holder after a six-month holding period. The conversion price was lowered to $0.05 per common
share for those holders who invested an additional $25,000 or more in the Company s common stock in the aforementioned September
2014 Private Placement. The preferred shares have full voting rights as if converted and have a fully participating liquidation
preference. 

At September 30, 2016, the 13,828 shares of
outstanding preferred stock had accumulated undeclared dividends of approximately $46,305, and could be converted into 3,691,709
shares of common stock, at the option of the holder. 

NOTE 10        SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATION  

Generally accepted accounting principles require
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, warrants, and common stock to be recognized in the
income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. 

In total, the Company recorded $74,253 and
$32,332 of stock-based compensation expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $379,301
and $305,297 of stock-based compensation expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively related
to employee and board member stock options and common stock and warrants issued to nonemployees.  As of September 30, 2016,
$192,768 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested share-based awards remains to be recognized over a period of
approximately four years. 

Options and Warrants  

The Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to estimate the grant-date fair value of option and warrant awards granted. The following assumptions were used for warrant
awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Expected Dividend Yield   because we do not currently pay dividends, the expected dividend yield is zero; 

 Expected Volatility in Stock Price   volatility based on our own trading activity was used to determine expected volatility; 

 Risk-free Interest Rate   reflects the average rate on a United States Treasury Bond with a maturity equal to the
expected term of the option; and 

 Expected Life of Award   because we have minimal experience with the exercise of options or warrants for use in determining
the expected life of each award, we used the option or warrant s contractual term as the expected life. 

Options  

During 2004, the Board of Directors of the
Company adopted a stock option plan (the  Plan ) and authorized up to 4,000,000 shares to be issued under the Plan.
In April 2009, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the number of shares to be issued under the Plan
to 10,000,000 shares and to include the independent Board Members in the Plan in lieu of continuing the previous practice of granting
warrants each quarter to independent Board Members for services. At September 30, 2016, there were 181,279shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the Plan. In 2014, the Board adopted an additional stock option plan which provides for an additional
5,000,000 shares which are all available as of December 31, 2015. The Plan is intended to permit stock options granted to employees
to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( Incentive Stock
Options ). All options granted under the Plan that are not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options are deemed to be
non-qualified options. Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company s common
stock on the date of grant, typically vest over periods up to 4 years and are typically exercisable up to 10 years. 

The fair value of each common stock option
issued is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table summarizes all stock
option activity of the Company for the period. 

The weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for stock option grants were as follows:  

2016     
 
     Expected Dividend Yield    
        0.00  %  
 
     Expected Volatility in Stock Price    
        145.82  %  
 
     Risk-Free Interest Rate    
        1.87  %  
 
     Expected Life of Stock Awards   Years    
        10.0     

The following table represents the Company s option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Warrants  

Warrants are issued to employees for expenses
and for compensation in lieu of cash as well as to third parties as payment for services and in conjunction with the issuance of
common stock.  The fair value of each common stock warrant issued for services is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 

The weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for stock warrant grants were as follows:  

2016     
 
     Expected Dividend Yield    
        0.00  %  
 
     Expected Volatility in Stock Price    
        120.75  %  
 
     Risk-Free Interest Rate    
        2.18  %  
 
     Expected Life of Stock Awards   Years    
        10.0     

The following table represents the Company s warrant activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The Company issued 1,689,786 warrants for services
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 at exercise prices from $0.03 to $0.10 per share, exercisable over a period of
ten years from the grant date.  All of the warrants with the exception of 745,664 vested immediately with the 745,664
warrants vesting one-twelfth per month over a one-year period. The fair value of the warrants was calculated as of the date of
the grant utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions as detailed above.  The total amount of the
fair value was $111,254 and is recorded as noncash share-based compensation expense as vesting occurs. 

ITEM
2.        MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

Vystar Corporation ( Vystar , the
 Company ,  we ,  us , or  our ) is the creator and exclusive owner of the innovative
technology to produce Vytex  Natural Rubber Latex ( NRL ). This technology reduces antigenic protein and non-rubbers
in natural rubber latex to virtually undetectable levels. With non-latex products growing at a rapid rate, the costs for these
alternative materials incurred by the manufacturers of these many different products have greatly decreased with nearly all substitute
materials being more expensive than NRL. This fact has changed in the past year as NRL prices have decreased and continue to fluctuate
in the low price zone with recent prices falling to a level below the original prices used to write the business plan for Vystar
Corporation in 2004. Supply for nitrile and neoprene has grown dramatically in the past year as additional facilities have come
on line mostly in Southeast Asia. We have introduced Vytex NRL, our  ultra-low protein  natural rubber latex, throughout
the worldwide marketplace that uses NRL or latex substitutes as a component of manufactured products and we have recently approved
an ultra-low ammonia version for limited exposure on the workers in the manufacturing world. Recent industry estimates have the
total rubber market at 11 million dry metric tons of which just over 1.2 million tons are in liquid latex form. There are more
than 40,000 products made from the liquid latex while the other eight million plus tons are used to produce tires and other hard
rubber products. Natural rubber latex is used in an extensive range of products including balloons, textiles, footwear and clothing
(threads), adhesives, foams, furniture, carpet, paints, coatings, protective equipment, sporting equipment, and specialty health
care products such as condoms, surgical and exam gloves, catheters and other items. 

We expanded our operations, particularly increasing
market acceptance and sales of Vytex NRL through our operating agreement with CT Group ( CT ). The decision to convert
to Vytex NRL is impacted by many functional areas including research and development, manufacturing, sales, marketing, purchasing
and finance. Each of these areas has a significantly different decision-making role per company thus the large difference in the
sales cycle. If the product is regulated and requires regulatory clearances or approvals prior to commercialization, the sales
cycle could be extended by another nine to twelve months for testing, filing and agency review. Our focus on the consumer foam
arena will greatly increase the global production and use of Vytex NRL and includes other licensees as well as the CT Group. The
CT Group was recently purchased by Halcyon Agri, based out of Singapore who is majority owned by the Sinochem Group of Beijing,
China. 

As noted in a press release issued March 19,
2014 and two subsequent releases, Vystar announced a strategic directional shift that has taken it into the multi-billion dollar
foam market using its patented Vytex NRL raw material. The raw material is then transformed by its Guatemalan partner, Islatex,
and potentially other companies into foam that is whiter, lighter weight and free of the off-gassing common among competitors'
memory foam products. Because Vytex NRL results in a more translucent and cleaner latex following the removal of proteins and non-rubbers,
manufacturers' production costs are decreased by utilizing less chemicals, water, and processing to remove proteins, and less dyes
and perfumes to cover up the yellow color and odor of non-Vytex natural rubber latex. In July 2015, we were notified by management
at Islatex in Guatemala that they were ceasing operations during the quarter. Since that time, Vystar has focused its efforts on
the foam core manufacturers in Asia and Europe with great success and added capacity for raw material and foam cores and pillows. 

As noted in the opening paragraphs, Vystar's
alliances have been formed to include mattress and pillow producers in the United States, business development strategists, and
selected retailers that have received containers of foam pillow and mattress cores for showroom analysis, market research and select
early sales efforts. Through these broad alliances, Vystar is offering a broad array of mattress and pillow cores to meet consumer
needs across the board. 

Vystar has moved into a targeted role in the
North American foam industry with specific large retail outlets identified for Vytex foam but key markets and online retailers
are ready to start offering mattresses and pillows for their customers. This is the first time that Vystar is participating directly
in end product sales. 

Recent Developments  

As previously noted, Vystar remains in discussions
with parties in the alternate rubber arena to license its technologies for removal of proteins from alternate latex sources that
have been shown to contain similar proteins. These discussions have intensified as this alternate industry has added companies
that show strong potential to fill a possible void in future demand. 

Recently, after two
presentations to technical audiences and much publicity surrounding the foam line launch, Vystar has been approached by companies
with novel ideas that include the use of its Vytex NRL raw material. Also, Vystar has also completed trials with European and Indian
makers of foam products to use its Vytex NRL raw material in their current offerings in their own areas as well as to supply added
needs for foam cores in both the mattress and topper arenas. Vystar has also completed a trial to procure pillows made with Vytex
NRL for global and domestic use with another trial planned for SE Asia. The sample runs performed in both the European and SE Asian
trials have led to manufacturing for mattress cores and pillows for domestic mattress manufacturers and possibly finished goods.
Vystar entered into discussions in July 2015 with a large international maker of natural rubber latex foam cores, who has an American
subsidiary and distribution center to supply foam of varying thicknesses and firmness to handle global and domestic business for
retail outlets and its online offerings. Vytex NRL passed the first trial phase at the American facility and will pursue doing
a full manufacturing run which will determine the starting level of domestic production. 

Working through distribution with global manufacturers,
Vystar has been able to secure a commitment from a major manufacturer of dielectric gloves that have qualified Vytex to run on
a full production line with potential to move to others lines and more of their international locations. Vystar has also progressed
well in pilot line trials with a major women s apparel retailer. The next stage of this relationship starts in November 2016
with licensing discussions and pilot test results review. 

We are expanding our usage of Vytex with a
worldwide manufacturer of cold seal adhesives to complement the current business in sports shoes. 

By introducing several new versions of Vytex
at the ILC meeting mid-2015, we have secured several trials with manufacturers in the toy arena who desire the lowest levels of
nitrosamine per European standards. Also, as an alternative raw material has ceased production, a catheter manufacturer is now
trialing Vytex for their internal balloons with results now being evaluated. 

A small trial is commencing with an American
manufacturer of exam gloves, using Vytex, as requested by a major outpatient provider of services. The dipping process for the
exam gloves is in process to be ready for shipment currently. 

In the foam arena, Vystar s partner Nature s
Home Solutions (NHS) believes Vytex, Natural Rubber Latex (NRL), is the future for pure natural latex in the home furnishings marketplace.
Vytex is the only eco-friendly and pure latex that will allow the industry to accentuate consistent sales growth and superior market
penetration. Our ability to innovate and integrate pure natural Vytex as the key component in the mattress and upholstery industry
will allow us to capitalize on the consumer s thirst for pure 100% natural products in living rooms and bedrooms. NHS 
unique product development, pricing strategy, unlimited supply chain capabilities, together with the benefit of a natural, eco-friendly
product will revolutionize the home furnishing industry. NHS recently completed the first of several international bed lines that
will be launching in the next two quarters. Vystar has expanded into the consumer arena with an introduction into the mattress,
mattress toppers and pillow arenas aligning with key foam manufacturers, and furniture stores in specific areas of the Unites States.
On September 30, 2016, Vystar signed an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement with Worcester, MA NHS who sources eco-friendly
materials and technologies for use in furnishings and potentially other markets thus replacing the prior agreement of January 2015.
NHS made its first license payment under the new contract in October 2016. NHS has produced multiple mattress lines with major
manufacturers like Spring Air, King Koil and Gold Bond encompassing approximately 25 different mattresses in both 100% Vytex and
Vytex-hybrid versions. These mattresses have already started shipping and are being sold in numerous retail locations across the
US. In addition, NHS has ordered more than a quarter million dollars of containers in varying densities and sizes and has purchase
orders prepared for another quarter million dollars of Vytex foam cores and pillows in the next 45 days. NHS sees steady increased
exponential growth throughout the remainder of 2017 and the companies, combined with Lien A, have structured the needed supply
chain. 

Board of Directors Member and Research
  Development Director Ranjit K. Matthan, Ph.D., revealed ongoing developments in the formulation of Vytex NRL with reduced
or no ammonia and nitrosamines at the International
Latex Conference (ILC) session titled  Advances in Environmentally Friendly Ultra Low Protein Natural Rubber Specialty
Latices  on August 12, 2015. The significant advances in aluminum hydroxide-treated Vytex NRL properties and applications
are potential game-changers for the issues of volatile organic content and nitrosamines for some critical latex products, such
as balloons, catheters ,  condoms, and other medical devices, as well as enabling cleaner and more sustainable work environments.
The expanded Vystar product grades make it applicable in a wider range of latex products with the advantage of improved environmental
impact through reduced leachables/extractables. The advances deliver a simplified, sustainable, totally safe raw material that
Vystar can offer for several applications without reservations about nitrosamines. Production scale up of all three newer
versions of Vytex NRL is currently being targeted as well as sample fulfillment. During the third quarter 2016 the sample production
runs were made available to companies globally focusing on low nitrosamine, no ammonia (employee safety in manufacturing end products)
and pre-vulcanized.Vystar has entered into early discovery with two separate companies in packaging upgrades and in biodegradable
processes. Each is in the early stage of feasibility. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 with
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues  

Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 from the Company were $34,180 and $96,447, respectively, for a decrease of $62,267 or 64.6%. The decrease in
revenues from operations was principally due to the closing of the Kiron division. Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 from the Company s continuing operations were $29,642 and $19,403, respectively, for an increase of $10,239
or 52.8%.  The increase in revenues from continuing operations was due to the new NHS contract and the resulting increase
in Vytex licensing fees.   

For the Company, gross margin increased from
$43,491 for the period ended September 30, 2015 to $49,896 for the period ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $6,405 or 14.7%.
 Gross margin from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $26,642 and $15,040, respectively,
for an increase of $11,602 or 77.1%.  Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,000 and
$4,363, respectively a decrease of $1,363 or 31.2%. 

Operating Expenses  

The Company s operating expenses consist
of general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and support costs
for management and administrative staff, and for other general and administrative costs, including professional fees related to
accounting, finance, and legal services as well as other operating expenses. The Company s operating expenses were $299,005
and $246,219 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for an increase of $52,786 or 21.4%. This was
primarily the result of increased legal expenses incurred during the period. The Company s operating expenses from continuing
operations were $247,422 and $210,670 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for an increase of
$36,752 or 17.4%. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income (expense) for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 consisted of interest expense of $40,125 and other expense of $14,456. This compares to interest expense
of $38,743 and interest income of $1 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 versus the same quarter in 2015 was attributable to an increase in the LIBOR index rate on the CMA Loan
as well as additional Shareholder Notes. The $14,456 of other expense was due to the expense associated with the repricing of some
previously issued common stock warrants. 

Net Loss  

Net loss was $306,391 and $241,532 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $64,859 or 26.9% in the net loss. The larger net loss
the Company experienced in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to the
increase in legal expense for the period. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 with the
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenues  

Revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 from the Company were $118,252 and $319,033, respectively, for a decrease of $200,781 or 62.9%. The decrease
in revenues from operations was due to a decrease in fees from the Kiron Division and its ultimate closure. The decrease in fee
revenue and cost of revenue from Kiron was due to a number of factors, principal of which was the elimination of the unprofitable
DME business. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 from the Company s continuing operations were
$37,264 and $42,727, respectively, for a decrease of $5,463 or 12.8%.  The decrease in revenues from continuing operations
was due to the drop in raw latex prices and the resultant drop in Vytex licensing fees.   

For the Company, gross margin fell from $135,107
for the period ended September 30, 2015 to $87,135 for the period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $47,972 or 35.5%.  Gross
margin from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $21,291 and $24,889, respectively,
for a decrease of $3,598 or 14.5%.  Cost of revenue from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $15,973 and $17,838, respectively a decrease of $1,865 or 10.5%. 

Operating Expenses  

The Company s operating expenses consist
of general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and support costs
for management and administrative staff, and for other general and administrative costs, including professional fees related to
accounting, finance, and legal services as well as other operating expenses. The Company s operating expenses were $924,817
and $1,049,550 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for a decrease of $124,733 or 11.9%. This was
primarily the result of the closing of the Kiron division. The Company s operating expenses from continuing operations were
$902,286 and $874,837 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for an increase of $27,449 or 3.1%.
This was primarily a result of increased legal expenses for the period. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income (expense) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 consisted of interest expense of $134,233, other expense of $14,456, and interest income of $1. This compares
to interest expense of $108,102, other expense of $15,899, and interest income of $40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in interest expense for the period ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015 was attributable to an
increase in the LIBOR index rate on the CMA Loan as well as additional Shareholder Notes. 

Net Loss  

Net loss was $986,476 and $1,038,650 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $52,174 or 5.0% in the net loss. The smaller net loss
the Company experienced in the period ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to the
elimination of the Company s former acting Chief Financial Officer as well as a reduction in third-party contract services. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The Company's financial statements are prepared
using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with GAAP and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.  However, the Company has incurred
significant losses and experienced negative cash flow since its inception.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of
$117,640 and a deficit in working capital of $2,147,866.  Further, at September 30, 2016, the accumulated deficit amounted
to $26,579,827.  As a result of the Company's history of losses and financial condition, there is substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

A successful transition to attaining profitable
operations is dependent upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Company s planned expenses and achieving a level
of revenue adequate to support the Company s cost structure. Management plans to finance future operations through the use
of cash on hand, increased revenue from Vytex division license fees, our credit facility, stock warrant exercises from existing
shareholders, raising capital through private placements of capital stock and debt. 

The Company s future expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including: the rate at which the Company can introduce and license Vytex NRL to manufacturers; the
costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; market acceptance
of the Company s products and services; and competing technological developments. As the Company expands its activities and
operations, cash requirements are expected to increase at a rate consistent with revenue growth after the Company has achieved
sustained revenue generation. 

There can be no assurances that the Company
will be able to achieve its projected level of revenue in 2016 and beyond. If the Company is unable to achieve its projected revenue
and is not able to obtain alternate additional financing of equity or debt, the Company would need to significantly reorient its
operations during 2016, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its business objectives
and as a result may require the Company to file for bankruptcy or cease operations. The financial  s tatements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts classified
as liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be forced to take any such actions. 

Sources and Uses of Cash  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, net cash used in operations was $537,620 and $510,519 respectively.  The negative cash flow for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from the net loss of $986,476, a decrease in allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable
of $60,266, offset by non-cash charges related to non-cash share-based compensation expense of $379,301, an increase in prepaid
expenses of $52,445, and an increase in accrued compensation and expenses of $28,906. The negative cash flow for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from the net loss of $1,038,650, and a decrease in accounts payable of $39,931 offset
by non-cash charges related to non-cash share-based compensation expense of $305,297, a decrease in accounts receivable of $53,978,
an increase in prepaid expenses of $86,945, and an increase in accrued compensation and expenses of $106,015. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the company disposed of $2,701 in net equipment, furniture and fixtures. There was no activity for the same period in 2015. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $570,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock and $53,500 from the exercise of
warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $385,500 from the sale of
common stock and $113,454 from the exercise of warrants. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that may be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or results of
operations.

to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to the reasonable assurance
level. 

(B)     Changes in internal control over financial
reporting 

We regularly review our system of internal
control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while
ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing
new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the first nine months of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
