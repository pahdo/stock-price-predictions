  (unaudited) 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS    
  Resource Real Estate Investors 7, L.P. ( R-7  or the  Partnership ) is a Delaware limited partnership which owns and operates multifamily residential rental properties located in Texas and South Carolina (the  Properties ). The Partnership also may invest in interests in real estate mortgages and other debt instruments that are secured, directly or indirectly, by multifamily residential rental properties, although the Partnership held no such investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The Partnership was formed on March 28, 2008 and commenced operations on June 16, 2008.  The General Partner, Resource Capital Partners, Inc. ( RCP , the  General Partner , or the  GP ), is in the business of sponsoring and managing real estate investment limited partnerships and tenant in common programs. RCP contributed   $1,000   in cash as its minimum capital contribution to the Partnership.  In addition, RCP held a   5.62%   limited partnership interest in the Partnership at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. RCP is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ( RAI ), a company operating in the real estate, financial fund management and commercial finance sectors. 
  On May 22, 2016, RAI agreed to be acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities.  The merger closed on September 8, 2016, and as a result, C-III indirectly controls RCP and all of the partnership units of the Partnership currently owned by RCP.  
  In accordance with the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the  Agreement ), the GP has the right to extend the Partnership term for a maximum of   two   years in the aggregate following the initial termination date. In February 2016, the GP extended the Partnership term for   one   year until March 28, 2017. The Partnership has begun the process of dissolution through the strategic disposal of assets. On March 19, 2015, the Partnership sold its interest in Woodland Hills. On December 1, 2015, the Partnership sold its interest in Tamarlane. On September 12, 2016, the Partnership sold its interest in Bent Oaks and Woodhollow. On September 30, 2016, the Partnership sold its interest in Woodland Village. The Partnership expects to to dispose of the remaining property in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  The Agreement provides that income is allocated as follows: first, to the Limited Partners ( LPs ) and the GP (collectively, the  Partners ) in proportion to and to the extent of the deficit balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts; second, to the Partners in proportion to the allocations of Distributable Cash (as defined in the Agreement); and third,   100%   to the LPs.  All losses are allocated as follows: first,   100%   to the LPs until the LPs have been allocated losses equal to the excess, if any, of their aggregate capital account balances over the aggregate Adjusted Capital Contributions (as defined in the Agreement); second, to the Partners in proportion to and to the extent of their respective remaining positive capital account balances, if any; and third,   100%   to the LPs. 
  Distributable cash from operations, payable monthly, as determined by the GP, is first allocated   100%   to the LPs until the LPs have received their Preferred Return (as defined in the Agreement); and thereafter,   80%   to the LPs and   20%   to the GP. 
  Distributable cash from capital transactions, as determined by the GP, is first allocated   100%   to the LPs until the LPs have received their Preferred Return; second,   100%   to the LPs until their Adjusted Capital Contributions have been reduced to zero; and thereafter,   80%   to the LPs and   20%   to the GP.  
  The consolidated financial statements and the information and tables contained in the notes thereto as of   September 30, 2016   are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  .

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows: 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as follows: 
    
                       Subsidiaries 
      
    Number  
  of Units 
      
    Location 
      RRE Tamarlane Holdings, LLC, or Tamarlane Apartments ( Tamarlane )    (1)  

RRE Bent Oaks Holdings, LLC, or Bent Oaks Apartments ( Bent Oaks )    (2)  

RRE Cape Cod Holdings,  LLC, or Cape Cod Apartments ( Cape Cod )

    San Antonio, TX 
      RRE Woodhollow Holdings, LLC, or Woodhollow Apartments ( Woodhollow )    (3)  

RRE Woodland Hills Holdings, LLC ( Hills )    (4)  

RRE Woodland Village Holdings, LLC, or Woodland Village Apartments ( Village )    (5)  

212 

(1) Tamarlane, a   115   unit multifamily apartment complex in Maine, was sold on December 1, 2015.  
  (2) Bent Oaks, a   146   unit multifamily apartment complex in Texas, was sold on September 12, 2016. 
  (3) Woodhollow, a   108   unit multifamily apartment complex in Texas, was sold on September 12, 2016. 
  (4) Hills, a   228   unit multifamily apartment complex in Georgia, was sold on March 19, 2015. 
  (5) Village, a   308   unit multifamily apartment complex in South Carolina, was sold on September 30, 2016. 
  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Assets Held for Sale 
  The Partnership presents the assets and liabilities of any rental properties which qualify as held for sale, separately in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Partnership does not consider the sale as probable until the purchase and sale agreement has been signed by both parties.  Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Both the real estate and the corresponding liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Subsequent to classification of an asset as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded. The Partnership had   one   rental property included in assets held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Geographic Concentration 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership's net investments in real estate in San Antonio, Texas represented   100%   of the Partnership s total rental properties, net. As a result, the geographic concentration of the Partnership s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in San Antonio, Texas real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets could adversely affect the Partnership s operating results.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The Partnership estimates the allowance for uncollectible receivables and loan losses and adjusts the balance quarterly.  The Partnership also estimates the liability for real estate taxes on the properties and adjusts the balance quarterly if necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
  (unaudited) 

Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Partnership paid   $1.1 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, in cash for interest. 
  Advertising 
  The Partnership expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.  Advertising costs, which are included in rental operating expenses, totaled   $45,000   and   $93,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $36,000   and   $96,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Deferred Financing Costs 
  Costs incurred to obtain financing have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective yield method. In accordance with adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03 "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", the Partnership has recorded deferred financing costs as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable.  
  Sale of Rental Property  
  The Partnership recognized the gains on sales of rental properties separately in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  Sales of rental properties completed by the Partnership do not represent a significant strategic shift in operations and , accordingly, the Partnership does not present discontinued operations. For information regarding the sales of the rental properties,   see Note 7   . 
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes or credits resulting from earnings or losses are payable by, or accrue to the benefit of, the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for income taxes in these consolidated financial statements. 
  The Partnership evaluates the benefits of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns under a two-step recognition and measurement process.  Only the largest amount of benefits from the tax positions that will more likely than not be sustainable upon examination are recognized by the Partnership.  The Partnership does not have any unrecognized tax benefits, nor interest and penalties, recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations and does not anticipate significant adjustments to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
  The Partnership is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and by the taxing authorities in those states in which the Partnership has significant business operations.  The Partnership is not currently undergoing any examinations by taxing authorities.  The Partnership may be subject to U.S. federal income tax and state/local income tax examinations for years 2013 through 2015. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenue is primarily derived from the rental of residential housing units with lease agreement terms of generally   one year   or less.  The Partnership recognizes revenue in the period that rent is earned, which is on a monthly basis.  The Partnership recognizes rent as income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease.  Additionally, any incentives included in the lease are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. 
  Included within rental income are other income amounts such as utility reimbursements, late fees, parking fees, pet fees and lease application fees which are recognized when earned or received. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   other income totaled   $235,000   and   $691,000  , respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   other income totaled   $229,000   and   $636,000  , respectively.

Long-Lived Assets 
  The Partnership reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If it is determined that an asset s estimated future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the carrying amount for that asset to its estimated fair value. The Partnership has estimated that the future cash flows from its properties will be sufficient to recover their 
  carrying amounts and, as a result, the Partnership did not recognize any impairment losses with respect to its Properties for the 
  nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
      Rental Properties 
  Rental properties are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  Buildings and improvements and personal property are depreciated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  The value of in-place leases is amortized over the average remaining term of the respective leases on a straight-line basis.  Useful lives used for calculating depreciation for financial reporting purposes are as follows: 

Tenant Receivables 
  Tenant receivables are stated at amounts due from tenants net of an allowance for uncollectible receivables.  Payment terms vary and receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Partnership determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, security deposits held, the Partnership s previous loss history, the tenants  current ability to pay their obligations to the Partnership, the general condition of the economy and the condition of the industry as a whole.  The Partnership writes off receivables when they become uncollectible.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   allowances for uncollectible receivables.  
  Redemptions 
  The LPs may request redemption of their units at any time.  The Partnership has no obligation to redeem any units and will do so only at the GP s discretion.  If the Partnership redeems units, the redemption price is generally the amount of the initial investment less all distributions from the Partnership to the LP, and less all organization and offering expenses charged to the LP. 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
    
  In January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items" ("ASU No. 2015-01"). The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.  ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. On January 1, 2016, the Partnership adopted ASU 2015-01 and the adoption had no impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" ( ASU 2015-02 ), which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest 
  entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. ASU 2015-02 is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2016, the Partnership adopted ASU 2015-02 and the adoption had no impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" ("ASU 2015-03"), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. Upon adoption, the Partnership applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and adjusted the balance sheet of each individual period presented to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. This guidance

was effective and was adopted by the Partnership on January 1, 2016 and as result the Partnership has reclassified   $261,000   of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015 from deferred financing costs to liabilities as reduction of the related mortgage notes payable 
    
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments" ("ASU 2015-16"), which eliminates the requirement to retroactively revise comparative financial information for prior periods presented in financial statements due to changes in provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in subsequent periods. Upon adoption, disclosure of the amounts recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date are required. ASU 2015-16 was effective and adopted by the Partnership on January 1, 2016 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective. 
    
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ("ASU No. 2014-09"), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP.  The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.  ASU No. 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. The Partnership is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this guidance on the Partnership s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" ("ASU No. 2014-15"). Under the new guidance, an entity should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a significant impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU No. 2016-02"). which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions and requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Partnership is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  ("ASU No. 2016-13") which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The standard update is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2019. The Partnership is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU No. 2016-13"), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-13 has been early adopted by the Partnership. As result of adoption, the Partnership has classified cash paid on early extinguishment of debt as cash used in financing activities.

NOTE 4 - MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE, NET 
  The following is a summary of mortgage notes payable, net (in thousands): 

(1)  Deferred financing costs include unamortized costs incurred to obtain financing which are being amortized over the term of the related debt.     
    
  Bent Oaks and Woodhollow were sold on September 12, 2016. Woodland Village was sold on September 30, 2016. Proceeds from these sales were used to pay the outstanding borrowings. The Partnership incurred losses of   $1.8 million   on extinguishment of debt due to prepayment penalties. 
  The following table includes additional information about the Partnership's mortgage notes payable, net (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Monthly payment includes principal and interest. Interest is at a fixed rate.  
              (2) 
    The Partnership has an option to extend the maturity date for an additional one year to January 1, 2020. During the extension 
     period, the interest rate would convert to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Bill Index Rate plus 2.5%. 
  (3)    The Property qualifies as held for sale and it is separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet.  
  Annual contractual principal payments on the mortgage notes payable for the future years ending   September 30,   are as follows (in thousands): 

The mortgage notes payable are with recourse only to the Properties securing them subject to certain limited standard exceptions, as defined in the mortgage notes, which the GP has guaranteed with respect to each property.  These exceptions are referred to as  carveouts .  In general, carveouts relate to damages suffered by the lender for a subsidiary s failure to pay rents, insurance or condemnation proceeds to the lender, to pay water, sewer and other public assessments or charges, to pay environmental compliance costs or to deliver books and records, in each case as required in the loan documents.  The exceptions also require the GP to guarantee payment of audit costs, lender s enforcement of its rights under the loan documents and payment of the loan if the subsidiary voluntarily files for bankruptcy or seeks reorganization, or if a related party of the subsidiary does so with respect to the subsidiary. 
  Deferred financing costs include unamortized costs incurred to obtain financing which are being amortized over the term of the related debt.  Accumulated amortization as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $136,000   and   $486,000  , respectively.  Estimated amortization of existing deferred financing costs for the next three years ending   September 30,   is as follows (in thousands):

NOTE 5 - CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
       In the ordinary course of its business operations, the Partnership has ongoing relationships with several related entities.  
  Substantially all of the receivables from related parties represents escrow funds held by RAI for self insurance. The Partnership's properties participate in insurance pools with other properties directly and indirectly managed by RAI for both property insurance and general liability. RAI holds the escrow funds related to the insurance pools on its books. The pool for the property insurance covers losses up to   $2.5 million   and the pool for the general liability covers losses up to the first   $50,000   per incident. Catastrophic insurance would cover property losses in excess of the insurance pool up to   $140 million  . Therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of the Partnership's insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's financial condition and operating results.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Partnership funded   $136,523   into the insurance pools.   
  On May 22, 2016, RAI agreed to be acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities.  The merger closed on September 8, 2016, and as a result, C-III indirectly controls RCP and all of the partnership units of the Partnership currently owned by RCP.  
  RCP is entitled to receive an annual investment management fee, payable monthly, equal to   1%   of the gross offering proceeds that have been deployed in real estate investments from the offering of partnership units, net of any amounts otherwise attributable to LP interests owned by RCP.  During the term of the Partnership, RCP must subordinate up to   100%   of its annual investment management fee to the receipt by the LPs of their Preferred Return.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of unpaid subordinated investment management fees totaled   $149,000   and   $15,000  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   the Partnership paid investment management fees totaling   $0   and   $1.9 million  , respectively.   
  A wholly-owned subsidiary of RCP, Resource Real Estate Management, LLC ( RREML ) is entitled to receive property and debt management fees. RREML engaged Resource Real Estate Management, Inc ( RREMI ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RAI, to manage the Partnership s Properties. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , property management fees due totaled   $37,000   and   $62,000  , respectively. Because the Partnership has not acquired any real estate debt investments, there were no debt management fees as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  During the ordinary course of business, RCP and RREMI advance funds for ordinary operating expenses on behalf of the Properties.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , advances due totaled   $35,000   and   $61,000  , respectively. Total reimbursable operating expenses incurred during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $468,000   and   $577,000  , respectively. Total reimbursable operating expenses incurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $1.3 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively. Reimbursed expenses include payroll and miscellaneous operating expenses. Reimbursed operating expenses are included in property rental operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Partnership pays investment management fees and property management fees to related parties.  These expenses are summarized as follows (in thousands):

NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
  In analyzing the fair value of its financial instruments disclosed or accounted for on a fair value basis, the Partnership follows the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The Partnership determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the financial instruments.  The fair value of cash, tenant receivables and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to their short term nature.  The hierarchy followed defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
  Level 1 -   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  
  Level 2 -   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset. 
  Level 3 -   Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Partnership s financial instruments: 
             
    Mortgage notes payable.    Rates currently available to the Partnership for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt. 
     The estimated fair value measurements of the mortgage notes payable are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Overview 
  We are a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on March 28, 2008 and commenced operations on June 16, 2008.  Through wholly owned subsidiaries, we own in fee, operate and invest in multifamily residential rental property located in San Antonio, Texas, which we refer to as our Property.    
  We have begun the process of dissolution through the strategic disposal of assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , we own one multifamily residential rental property through our 100% owned subsidiary. On March 19, 2015, the Partnership sold its interest in Woodland Hills. On December 1, 2015, the Partnership sold its interest in Tamarlane.  On September 12, 2016, the Partnership sold its interest in Bent Oaks and Woodhollow. On September 30, 2016, the Partnership sold its interest in Woodland Village. We expect to dispose the remaining asset in the fourth quarter 2016.  
  The following table presents our multifamily residential rental properties: 

(1) Original face value of mortgage divided by total property capitalization, including reserves, escrows, fees and closing costs. 
  (2) Tamarlane, a 115 unit multifamily apartment complex in Maine, was sold on December 1, 2015. 
  (3) Bent Oaks, a 146 unit multifamily apartment complex in Texas, was sold on September 12, 2016. 
  (4) Woodhollow, a 108 unit multifamily apartment complex in Texas, was sold on September 12, 2016.  
  (5) Hills, a 228 unit multifamily apartment complex in Georgia, was sold on March 19, 2015. 
  (6) Woodland Village, a 308 unit multifamily apartment complex in South Carolina, was sold on September 30, 2016.

The following table sets forth operating statistics about our multifamily residential rental properties. This table does not include information with respect to two properties, Woodland Hills and Tamarlane, which were sold during fiscal year 2015: 

(1) 
    Number of occupied units divided by total units adjusted for any unrentable units; average calculated on a weekly basis. 
              (2) 
    Average rental revenue divided by total rentable square footage.  We calculate average rental revenue by dividing gross rental revenue by the number of months in the period. 
              (3) 
    Rental operating expenses, excluding certain one-time expenses funded from reserves for capital expenditures, and general and administrative expenses, excluding asset management fees and transaction expenses, as a percentage of rental income, excluding any adjustment for concessions.  
      
  Results of Operations 
  We generate our income from the net revenues we receive from our Properties. In addition to the rental revenues we also generate funds from the sales or refinancing of our Properties as seen with the sale of the Hills in the first quarter of 2015, the sale of Tamarlane in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the sale of Bent Oaks, Woodhollow and Woodland Village in September of 2016. Should economic conditions in the areas in which our remaining property is located deteriorate, we could experience lower occupancy, lower rental revenues and higher operating costs, all of which could harm our operations and financial condition, reduce the value of our Properties and limit our ability to make distributions to our limited partners. 
  Our operating results and cash flows from our Properties are affected by four principal factors: 
             
    occupancy and rental rates, 
                
    property operating expenses, 
                
    interest rates on the related financing,  
                
    capital expenditures, and  
                
    net proceeds from property dispositions. 
     The amount of rental revenues from our Properties depends upon their occupancy rates and concessions granted.  We seek to maximize our rental revenues through aggressive property-level programs, including, in particular, our Lease Rent Optimizer, or LRO, program which includes rent concessions.  Under our LRO program, we seek to price our rents for apartment units on a daily basis, based upon inventory in the marketplace and competitors  pricing.  Our Properties experienced an overall decrease in the average occupancy rate during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of approximately   0.18%   with an average occupancy of   93.6%   as compared to an average occupancy rate of   93.7%   during the same period of   2015  . Our Properties average effective  
  
    (Back to Index)  
  19 

rent per square foot of remained the same during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   for the same Properties.  
  We seek to control operating expenses through our General Partner s automated purchase order system that compares actual to budgeted expenses and requires management approval of variances, and through the use of third-party service providers to seek best available pricing. 
  Our existing financing is at fixed rates of interest and, accordingly, our interest cost has remained relatively stable during 
  the period of our ownership of the Properties. Based upon current economic conditions we expect that our financing costs will 
  remain relatively stable during fiscal year 2016. 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per unit data):   

  Revenues 
  We attribute the   $589,000   decrease in revenues principally to the sale of the Tamarlane property in the fourth quarter of 2015. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , revenue attributable to Tamarlane was   $515,000  . Average effective rent per square foot and occupancy rates have varied within our expected range. 
  Expenses 
  We attribute the   $569,000   decrease in expenses principally to: 

(Back to Index)

     a   $25,000   decrease in property and general liability insurance claims across the RAI managed portfolio, 
    
     a   $92,000   decrease in real estate taxes primarily attributable to the sale of Tamarlane in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

a   $43,000   decrease in management fees corresponding to the decrease in revenues attributable to the sale of the Tamarlane property in the fourth quarter of 2015 and sale of Bent Oaks, Woodhollow and Woodland Village in September 2016. 
       
     a   $397,000   decrease in depreciation and amortization related to the sale of the Tamarlane property in the fourth quarter of 2015 and sale of Bent Oaks, Woodhollow and Woodland Village in September 2016 as depreciation was ceased as the assets were considered held for sale. 
  Other income (expense) 
             
    Gains on sale of rental properties included in Other income (expense) increased by   $24.5 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as detailed below (in thousands):

    The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per unit data):   

  Revenues 
  We attribute the   $1.9 million   decrease in revenues principally to the sale of the Hills and Tamarlane properties in the 
  first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively as well as sale of Bent Oaks, Woodhollow and Woodland Village in September 2016. During the   nine   month ended   September 30, 2015   revenue attributable the Hills and Tamarlane were   $602,000   and   $1.5 million  , respectively. Average effective rent per square foot and occupancy rates have varied within our expected range. 
    
  Expenses 
  We attribute the   $1.3   decrease in expenses principally to: 
              
    a   $33,000   decrease in property and general liability insurance claims across the RAI managed portfolio, 

a   $320,000   decrease in rental operating expenses due to sale of the Hills and Tamarlane in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively, and sale of Bent Oaks, Woodhollow and Woodland Village in September 2016. 

(Back to Index)  
  22 

a   $161,000   decrease in management fees corresponding to the decrease in revenues attributable to the sales of both the Hills and Tamarlane.  
                
    a   $640,000   decrease in depreciation and amortization related to the sale of the Hills and Tamarlane as well as sale of Bent Oaks, Woodhollow and Woodland Village in September 2016.  
     Other income (expense) 
             
    a   $391,000   decrease in interest expense primarily is related to the payoff of both the Hills and Tamarlane mortgages upon the sales of the Properties.  
                
    Gains on sale of rental properties included in Other income (expense) increased by   $14.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as detailed below (in thousands): 

Additionally, the Partnership incurred losses of   $1.8 million   on extinguishment of debt as a result of prepayments on outstanding borrowings. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Includes changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
       
  Our liquidity needs consist principally of funds used to pay the Properties  debt service, operating expenses, capital 
  expenditures and monthly distributions to the limited partners. Our ability to meet our liquidity needs will be subject to our ability to generate cash from both operations and sales, and to control property operating expenses. The ability to generate cash from operations will depend on the occupancy rates, rates charged to tenants compared with competing properties in the area and the ability of tenants to pay rent. Occupancy rates can fluctuate based on changes in local market conditions where the Properties are located such as: excessive building resulting in an oversupply of similar properties, deterioration of surrounding areas, a decrease in market rates or local economic conditions including unemployment rates. The rental rates charged to tenants compared to  
  
    (Back to Index)  
  23 

competing properties can be impacted by a lack of perceived safety, convenience and attractiveness of a property. We have retained a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the the Properties to ensure adequate operating liquidity for the remaining term of the Partnership, pay off related debt and make distributions to investors. We also have retained a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the Properties to ensure adequate funding for any future capital expenditures which we may determine to be necessary to position the remaining properties for eventual sale. 
    
  The following table sets forth the capital expenditures incurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which are discretionary in nature (in thousands): 

We have begun the process of dissolution through the strategic disposal of assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , we own one multifamily residential rental Property through our 100% owned subsidiary, which is expected to be disposed of in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  In connection with the acquisitions of our Properties, we have   $5.9 million   carrying value of total mortgage financing outstanding. For information regarding mortgage financing with respect to each Property,   see Note 4   of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.   
  Our payables to related parties consist of primarily of investment management fees due to our General Partner, payable monthly, equal to 1% of the gross offering proceeds, net of any limited partnership interest owned by the General Partner.  The General Partner must subordinate up to 100% of its annual investment management fee to the receipt by the limited partners of their Preferred Return. The limited partners partially received their Preferred Return during 2015 due to the sale of the Hills in the amount of   $1.9 million  . The investment management fee continues to accrue for the remaining rental properties.  
  The aggregate debt service requirement for our loans on the one remaining asset for the   twelve   months ending   September 30,     2017   is   $453,000  , including principal payments of   $104,000  .  
  Redemption of Units 
  We are permitted, in our General Partner s sole discretion, to redeem units upon a unitholder s request.  However, we have no obligation to redeem units at any time, and we can decline to redeem units for any reason.  Cumulatively through   September 30, 2016  , a total of 5,000 units have been redeemed at an aggregate price of $46,710, although no units were redeemed in the   nine   months then ended. 
  Legal Proceedings 
  We are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  Management believes that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  Critical Accounting Policies  
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and cost and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to certain accrued liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the discussion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations, including contingent obligations, other than guarantees by the General Partner of certain limited standard expectations to the non-recourse nature of the mortgage notes which are secured by the Properties.

    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Disclosure Controls 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our General Partner, including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  Under the supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our General Partner, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

  (b)         Upon Default  .   
  (i)         IF BUYER, WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO DO SO AND IN DEFAULT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FAILS TO COMPLETE CLOSING OR OTHERWISE DEFAULTS UNDER OR BREACHES THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND BE PAID THE DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT SELLER S ACTUAL DAMAGES, IN THE EVENT OF A BUYER DEFAULT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE.  AFTER NEGOTIATION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT, CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF  
  
   2 
  LW:1033795.4 

THIS AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES THAT SELLER WOULD INCUR IN SUCH EVENT.  EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ABOVE AND THE FACT THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED, AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION.  THE RIGHT OF SELLER TO BE PAID THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE SELLER S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR BUYER S FAILURE TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY OR OTHER BREACH OR DEFAULT OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
  (ii)         If Seller, without the right to do so and in default of its obligations under this Agreement, fails to complete Closing or otherwise defaults under or breaches this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to (i) terminate this Agreement, in which event Buyer shall be entitled to the immediate return of the entire Deposit as its sole and exclusive remedy (subject to the remainder of this paragraph) and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further obligations under this Agreement, except those matters expressly provided in this Agreement to survive termination, or (ii) institute a civil court action for specific performance (but not damages); provided that Buyer shall commence its action of specific performance against Seller within ninety (90) days after the scheduled Closing Date. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BUYER SEEK OR BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECULATIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, ALL OF WHICH BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES, FROM SELLER FOR ANY BREACH BY SELLER OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS OR ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO FILE ANY LIS PENDENS OR ANY LIEN AGAINST ANY PROPERTY UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS FILED AN ACTION SEEKING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph and the Seller default or failure at issue is the failure by Seller to deliver on or before the Closing Date one or more of the documents for the Closing required under Subsections 15(a)(i)-(vii) and (x)-(xii), duly executed and acknowledged by Seller where applicable, then in addition to a return of the entire Deposit, Buyer shall be entitled to damages from Seller in an amount equal to all of the losses, costs and expenses actually incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the pursuit of the transactions contemplated by same or otherwise in reliance upon Seller timely performing all of its obligations under this Agreement for Closing, such damages not to exceed $500,000 in the aggregate.   Buyer s claim for damages under the preceding sentence shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and Seller acknowledges that such claim shall not be barred by any limitations on damages or remedies within this paragraph or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
  (c)         Upon Closing  .  If Closing is completed hereunder, Escrow Holder shall pay the Deposit to Seller as a credit against the Purchase Price.   
  (d)         Upon Termination by Buyer  .  If Buyer terminates this Agreement as a result of Seller s default or pursuant to the exercise of any right of termination permitted by this Agreement, upon the earlier to occur of:  (i) receipt by Escrow Holder of written joint instructions consistent with this Agreement from Seller and Buyer or (ii) entry of a final and unappealable adjudication determining which party is entitled to receive the Deposit, the Deposit shall be distributed in accordance with such written instructions or adjudication.   
  
   3 
  LW:1033795.4 

(e)         Hard Deposit  .  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that $250,000 of the Deposit (the    Hard Deposit   ) shall be (i) a  hard  deposit that is non-refundable to Buyer except as expressly set forth in this Section 3(e) and (ii) immediately released by Escrow Holder to Seller upon Escrow Holder s receipt of the Deposit pursuant to Section 3(a) above;   provided  ,   however  , that Buyer shall be entitled to a return by Seller of the Hard Deposit in the case of a termination by Buyer under Section 3(b)(ii) (Seller Default) or a termination by Buyer where authorized under Section 13 or 14 of this Agreement.  This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
  4.         Closing  .  The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property (the    Closing   ) shall take place on or before   September 15, 2016   or at earlier date as mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (the    Closing Date   ).  The Closing shall be conducted through an escrow with the Escrow Holder, with escrow fees to be paid equally by Seller and Buyer.  IT IS AGREED THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

5.         Inspection and Title Review. 
    
  (a)         Inspection Period  .  Buyer and its authorized agents and representatives shall have the right to enter upon the Land and Improvements (including all of the apartment units, but subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases and in accordance with applicable law) at all reasonable times during normal business hours to inspect and conduct reasonably necessary inspections and tests on the Property at its sole cost and expense, including, without limitation, engineering and hazardous material inspections; provided, however, any intrusive physical testing will be conducted by Buyer only after obtaining Seller s prior written consent.  The right granted in the immediately preceding sentence may be exercised during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement.  Buyer shall bear the cost of all inspections and tests, and Buyer shall give reasonable notice to the management of any inspection or test to be conducted on the Property. Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds Seller and the Property harmless as to all loss, property damage, bodily injury, cost or expense resulting from Buyer s inspections and tests of the Property, including, without limitation, claims for services rendered by third parties conducting such inspections and tests.  Buyer shall also restore the Land and Improvements to the condition in which the same were found before any such entry upon the Property and inspection or examination was undertaken.  Such agreement to repair and restore, and to indemnify and hold harmless Seller shall expressly survive closing or any termination of the Agreement, but shall not apply to pre-existing conditions and matters merely discovered by Buyer or such third parties.  Buyer shall maintain, or shall cause its contractors to maintain, public liability and property damage insurance insuring Buyer (and naming Seller as an additional insured party) against any liability arising out of any entry or inspections of the Property or work performed about the Property pursuant to the provisions hereof and shall deliver certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage to Seller prior to any entry by Buyer or its contractors on the Property.   
    
  (b)         Document Review  .  Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (or make available for inspection at the Property) copies of the items listed on   Schedule 5(b)   attached hereto and made a part hereof, but only to the extent such items are in Seller s possession or control (collectively,    Documents    provided that Leases shall be available for inspection at the Property  
  
   4 
  LW:1033795.4 

only.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, and shall have no liability with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information, data or conclusions contained in any information provided to Buyer, and Buyer shall make its own independent inquiry regarding the economic feasibility, physical condition and environmental state of the Property during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending at 5:00 pm (Eastern) on   August 17, 2016   (the    Inspection Period   ).  
  (c)         Assignment or Termination of Contracts  .  Buyer shall assume all Contracts at Closing subject to this   Section 5(c)  .  Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer may advise Seller in writing of any Contracts that it elects to have terminated upon Closing and Seller shall provide timely notices of termination;   provided  ,   however  , that Seller shall not terminate, and Buyer expressly agrees to assume, all Contracts that are not cancellable by their terms or which cannot be terminated without cost or penalty to Seller. At Closing, Seller shall assign and Buyer shall assume all Contracts that have not terminated as of the Closing Date, including without limitation, any remaining rights and obligations under Contracts under which the notice required to terminate such Contracts, though delivered, will not have run prior to Closing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all existing agreements for management of the Property shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, as well as any so-called  master  Contracts that pertain to multiple properties controlled by Seller and its affiliates. 
  (d)         Right of Termination  .  If Buyer determines that the Property is not suitable in Buyer s sole discretion, then Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller on or before 5:00 pm (Eastern) on the last day of the Inspection Period and this Agreement shall be null and void for all purposes (except for provisions that expressly survive hereunder) and the Deposit (less the Hard Deposit) shall be returned to Buyer. In the event that Buyer does not deliver notice of termination of this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate under this   Section 5(d)   and the Deposit shall be non-refundable to Buyer except in accordance with the terms of   Section 3(b)(ii)   above or a termination by Buyer where authorized under Section 13 or 14 of this Agreement.  
  6.         Condition of Title  .   
  (a)       Commitment to Insure  .  Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of Seller s Owner s Policy of title insurance and Buyer shall promptly order a commitment from the Title Company (the    Title Commitment   ) to provide a standard owner s title insurance policy for the Property in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (the    Title Policy    and (ii) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy the most recent ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey of the Property in Seller s possession, if any (the    Existing Survey   ).  Buyer, at its option and expense, may obtain a new survey, or an update of the Existing Survey of the Real Property (the    Survey   ).  
  (b)    During the Inspection Period, Buyer shall review title to the Real Property as disclosed by the Title Commitment and, if obtained, the Survey.  Seller shall have no obligation to cure title objections except to satisfy and remove liens of an ascertainable amount created by, through, or under Seller or its affiliates, which liens Seller shall cause to be released at the Closing or affirmatively insured over by the Title Company.  Seller further agrees to remove any exceptions or encumbrances to title which are created by Seller after the Effective Date of this Agreement without Buyer s written consent or which Seller commits in writing to cure (collectively with the liens addressed in the preceding sentence, the    Seller Cure Items   ).   
  
   5 
  LW:1033795.4 

Buyer may terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Deposit (less the Hard Deposit) at any time prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period or if the Title Company revises the Title Commitment after the expiration of the Inspection Period to add or modify exceptions in a material adverse manner, if such additions or modifications are not acceptable to Buyer and are not removed by the Closing Date.  Seller shall execute at Closing an affidavit as to authority, the rights of tenants in occupancy and the status of mechanics  liens (and sufficient to remove from the Title Policy any exception for mechanics  liens filed against the Real Property which relate to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date) in form acceptable to Seller as the Title Company shall require for the issuance of the Title Policy.  All matters to which exception is taken in the Title Commitment or any revision thereto, other than the Seller Cure Items, constitute the    Permitted Exceptions   .  Seller shall cause Title Company to be irrevocably committed at Closing to issue the Title Policy to Buyer, dated effective as of the date of Closing and subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.  With such a commitment, the Title Policy may be delivered after Closing if that is customary in the locality.        
  7.         Delivery of Possession  .  Actual sole and exclusive physical possession of the Property shall be given to Buyer at Closing unoccupied and free of any leases, claims to or rights of possession other than the rights of tenants under Leases by delivery of the keys to the Property and Seller s special or limited warranty deed (the    Deed   ) in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit B  , and Seller s bill of sale in the form of   Exhibit C   to this Agreement duly executed by Seller (the    Bill of Sale   ).   
  8.         Apportionments  .   All property related items of income and expense, including but not limited to the following, shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to the Closing Date (the    Pro Ration Date   ) as follows: 
  (a)         Taxes.       All real estate taxes, charges, and assessments affecting the Property (collectively,    Taxes   ) shall be prorated on a per diem basis as of the Pro Ration Date, applying any discount for early payment applicable as of the Pro Ration Date, and on the basis of the actual fiscal year for which such taxes are assessed, and Buyer shall assume liability for payment of Taxes accruing in the year in which Closing occurs.  In the event that the amount of Taxes for the current year is unknown at Closing, the Taxes shall be prorated based on the mill rate for taxes assessed for the immediately preceding year, taking into account the current appraised value for the Property issued by the County Appraisal District, and Buyer shall notify Seller of any necessary adjustment to such proration within thirty (30) days after when correct tax figures are known, and thereafter any necessary adjustments shall be made.  Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller has or may file appeals (the    Appeals   ) with respect to the current fiscal year and also with respect to prior year(s) ad valorem property taxes applicable to the Property (the    Appealed Taxes   ).  Seller shall be entitled, in Seller s sole discretion, to continue to pursue such Appeals after the Closing Date. In the event that any such Appeal is successful in reducing the amount of Appealed Taxes payable with respect to prior years, Seller shall be entitled to the full amount of any rebate, refund or reduction resulting from such Appeal.  In the event that any such Appeal is successful in reducing the amount of Appealed Taxes payable with respect to the current fiscal year, Seller and Buyer shall prorate the net proceeds of any rebate, refund or reduction resulting from such Appeal relating to the current fiscal year, after payment of Seller s third party costs incurred in connection with the Appeal. This paragraph shall expressly survive Closing and the recordation of the Deed. 
  (b)         Rents  .     Rents and other recurring income relating to the Property and collected by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs shall be deemed earned ratably on a per diem basis and shall be prorated  
  
   6 
  LW:1033795.4 

as of the Pro Ration Date. Amounts collected by Seller prior to the date of Closing as rent for each day occurring after the Pro Ration Date and all other prepaid amounts shall be credited to the Buyer at Closing. All such amounts collected by Seller or Buyer from tenants or other payors after Closing shall be paid over and applied in the following order of priority:  (i) first, on account of rents and other sums due to Seller and Buyer (and pro rated between them as of the Pro Ration Date) for the month in which Closing occurs; (ii) then, on account of rents and other sums due to Seller from the respective tenant or payor for any month prior to the month of Closing; and (iii) thereafter, on account of rents and other sums due to Buyer from the respective tenant or payor after Closing. 
  (c)         Other  .     All normal and customarily proratable items including without limitation operating expenses,  personal property taxes, minimum water and sewer rentals, payments due under the Contracts which are to be assigned to Buyer, prepaid license fees and other charges for licenses and permits for the Real Property which will remain in effect for Buyer s benefit after Closing and municipal rubbish removal charges, shall be apportioned pro rata between Seller and Buyer on a per diem basis based upon a calendar year or calendar month (as applicable).  
  (d)         Security Deposits  .  The total sum of all tenant security deposits currently held by Seller, together with all interest earned thereon as of the Closing Date, shall be transferred to Buyer at Closing by operation of a credit against the Purchase Price. 
  (e)         Utility Meter Readings  .  Seller shall obtain readings of the water, electric, gas and other utility meters servicing the Real Property (other than meters measuring exclusively utility consumption which is to be paid in full by tenants under Leases) to a date no sooner than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date.  At or prior to Closing, Seller shall pay all charges based upon such meter readings, adjusted to include a reasonable estimate of the additional charges due for the period from the dates of the respective readings until the Closing Date.  If Seller is unable to obtain readings of any meters prior to the Closing Date, Closing shall be completed without such readings and upon the obtaining thereof, Seller shall pay the charges incurred prior to the Closing Date as reasonably determined by both Buyer and Seller based upon such readings, and at Closing, Seller shall deposit with the Title Company an amount reasonably estimated to represent the anticipated obligation of Seller under this sentence.  This paragraph shall survive Closing accordingly. 
  (f)         RUBS  .  In addition to any other prorations described in this Agreement, any ratio utility billing systems (   RUBS   ) applicable to the Property, for the following categories of utilities and other reimbursements: (i) electricity, (ii) gas, (iii) water / sewer, (iv) trash, (v) pest control and (vi) other typical items, attributable to the uncollected or trailing collections for the two calendar months prior to Closing will be reflected as a credit to Seller at Closing and will be calculated for closing purposes on the uncollected or trailing collections monthly periods based on the monthly average actual trailing RUBS for six months prior to Closing according to the income statements prepared by Seller and provided to Buyer.  A subsequent cash adjustment of RUBS between Seller and Buyer will be made when actual figures are available for such 2-month period, but in all events within 120 days after the Closing Date.  Seller and Buyer each agree to provide such information as the other may reasonably request regarding RUBS and the billing, collection, and payment thereof. 
  
   7 
  LW:1033795.4 

(g)         True-up  .  Subsequent to the Closing, if at any time during the 60-day period following Closing the actual amount of any pro-rated items that were based upon estimations at Closing, including without limitation, utilities and other operating expenses with respect to the Property for the month in which the Closing occurs, are determined, the parties agree to adjust the proration of utilities and other operating expenses and, if necessary, to refund or repay such sums as shall be necessary to effect such adjustment.  For clarification, this Section 8(g) shall not apply to Taxes, Rents or RUBS which shall be pro-rated and paid under Sections 8(a), 8(b) and 8(f) respectively. This provision shall survive Closing and recordation of the Deed. 
  (h)         Closing Costs  .  Seller shall pay (i)   of all escrow fees, (ii) premium for a basic TLTA T-1 owner s policy(s) of title insurance in the amount of the Purchase Price, and (iii) all of Seller s legal costs and expenses. Buyer shall pay (i) title premiums for any endorsements to the owner s policy of title insurance, together with all costs and premiums relating to any loan policy of title insurance and endorsements for the benefit of Buyer s lender, if any, (ii) cost of the Survey, (iii)   of all escrow fees, (iv) all other closing and recording costs with respect to the conveyance of the Property, (v) all costs, fees, recordation taxes and assessments with respect to any financing of Buyer, and (vi) Buyer s legal costs and expenses. All other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby and not specifically allocated herein shall be paid by the party incurring the same. It is contemplated by the parties that no realty transfer taxes, including without limitation, any state or local transfer taxes or recordation charges, will be due as a result of this transaction. 
  (i)         Up Front Payments  .

If for the current ad valorem tax year the taxable value of the Property that is the subject of this Agreement is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for appraisal of the Property at less than its market value, the Buyer may not be allowed to qualify the Property for that special appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the Property may then be appraised at its full market value.  In addition, the transfer of the Property or a subsequent change in the use of the Property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer or the change in the use of the Property.  The taxable value of the Property and the applicable method of appraisal for the current tax year is public information and may be obtained from the Travis County Appraisal District. 
  (b)         Notice Regarding Possible Annexation  .  If the Property that is the subject of this Agreement is located outside the limits of a municipality, the Property may now or later be included in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality and may now or later be subject to annexation by the municipality.  Each municipality maintains a map that depicts its boundaries and extraterritorial jurisdiction.

  (c)         Property Located in a Certificated Service Area of a Utility Service Provider  .  The Property that you are about to purchase may be located in a certificated water or sewer service area, which is authorized by law to provide water or sewer service to the properties in the certificated area.

  LW:1033795.4 

located in a certificated area there may be special costs or charges that you will be required to pay before you can receive water or sewer service.  There may be a period required to construct lines or other facilities necessary to provide water or sewer service to the Property.  You are advised to determine if the Property is in a certificated area and contact the utility service provider to determine the cost that you will be required to pay and the period, if any, that is required to provide water or sewer service to the Property. 
  (d)         Notice Regarding District  .  If the Property is situated in a utility or other statutorily created district providing water, sewer, drainage, or flood control facilities and services, Chapter 49, Texas Water Code, requires Seller to deliver and Buyer to sign the statutory notice relating to the tax rate, bonded indebtedness, or standby fees of the district before final execution of this Agreement. 
  (e)         Notice Regarding Coastal Property  .  If the Property adjoins or shares a common boundary with the tidally influenced submerged lands of the state, Section 33.135, Texas Natural Resources Code, requires a notice regarding coastal area property to be included as part of this Agreement. 
  (f)         Lead Disclosure  .  If apartments or other residential units are on the Property and the units were built before 1978, federal law requires a lead-based paint and hazard disclosure statement to be made part of this Agreement.

  (i)         IF BUYER, WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO DO SO AND IN DEFAULT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FAILS TO COMPLETE CLOSING OR OTHERWISE DEFAULTS UNDER OR BREACHES THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND BE PAID THE DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT SELLER S ACTUAL DAMAGES, IN THE EVENT OF A BUYER DEFAULT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE.  AFTER NEGOTIATION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT, CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF  
  
   2 
  LW:1034353.1 

THIS AGREEMENT, THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES THAT SELLER WOULD INCUR IN SUCH EVENT.

BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO FILE ANY LIS PENDENS OR ANY LIEN AGAINST ANY PROPERTY UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS FILED AN ACTION SEEKING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph and the Seller default or failure at issue is the failure by Seller to deliver on or before the Closing Date one or more of the documents for the Closing required under Subsections 15(a)(i)-(vii) and (x)-(xii), duly executed and acknowledged by Seller where applicable, then in addition to a return of the entire Deposit, Buyer shall be entitled to damages from Seller in an amount equal to all of the losses, costs and expenses actually incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the pursuit of the transactions contemplated by same or otherwise in reliance upon Seller timely performing all of its obligations under this Agreement for Closing, such damages not to exceed $500,000 in the aggregate.   Buyer s claim for damages under the preceding sentence shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and Seller acknowledges that such claim shall not be barred by any limitations on damages or remedies within this paragraph or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
  (c)         Upon Closing  .  If Closing is completed hereunder, Escrow Holder shall pay the Deposit to Seller as a credit against the Purchase Price.   
  (d)         Upon Termination by Buyer  .

  LW:1034353.1 

(e)         Hard Deposit  .  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that $250,000 of the Deposit (the    Hard Deposit   ) shall be (i) a  hard  deposit that is non-refundable to Buyer except as expressly set forth in this Section 3(e) and (ii) immediately released by Escrow Holder to Seller upon Escrow Holder s receipt of the Deposit pursuant to Section 3(a) above;   provided  ,   however  , that Buyer shall be entitled to a return by Seller of the Hard Deposit in the case of a termination by Buyer under Section 3(b)(ii) (Seller Default) or a termination by Buyer where authorized under Section 13 or 14 of this Agreement.  This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
  4.         Closing  .  The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property (the    Closing   ) shall take place on or before   September 15, 2016   or at earlier date as mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (the    Closing Date   ).  The Closing shall be conducted through an escrow with the Escrow Holder, with escrow fees to be paid equally by Seller and Buyer.  IT IS AGREED THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

5.         Inspection and Title Review. 
    
  (a)         Inspection Period  .  Buyer and its authorized agents and representatives shall have the right to enter upon the Land and Improvements (including all of the apartment units, but subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases and in accordance with applicable law) at all reasonable times during normal business hours to inspect and conduct reasonably necessary inspections and tests on the Property at its sole cost and expense, including, without limitation, engineering and hazardous material inspections; provided, however, any intrusive physical testing will be conducted by Buyer only after obtaining Seller s prior written consent.  The right granted in the immediately preceding sentence may be exercised during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement.  Buyer shall bear the cost of all inspections and tests, and Buyer shall give reasonable notice to the management of any inspection or test to be conducted on the Property. Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds Seller and the Property harmless as to all loss, property damage, bodily injury, cost or expense resulting from Buyer s inspections and tests of the Property, including, without limitation, claims for services rendered by third parties conducting such inspections and tests.  Buyer shall also restore the Land and Improvements to the condition in which the same were found before any such entry upon the Property and inspection or examination was undertaken.  Such agreement to repair and restore, and to indemnify and hold harmless Seller shall expressly survive closing or any termination of the Agreement, but shall not apply to pre-existing conditions and matters merely discovered by Buyer or such third parties.  Buyer shall maintain, or shall cause its contractors to maintain, public liability and property damage insurance insuring Buyer (and naming Seller as an additional insured party) against any liability arising out of any entry or inspections of the Property or work performed about the Property pursuant to the provisions hereof and shall deliver certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage to Seller prior to any entry by Buyer or its contractors on the Property.

   4 
  LW:1034353.1 

only.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, and shall have no liability with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information, data or conclusions contained in any information provided to Buyer, and Buyer shall make its own independent inquiry regarding the economic feasibility, physical condition and environmental state of the Property during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending at 5:00 pm (Eastern) on   August 17, 2016   (the    Inspection Period   ).  
  (c)         Assignment or Termination of Contracts  .  Buyer shall assume all Contracts at Closing subject to this   Section 5(c)  .  Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer may advise Seller in writing of any Contracts that it elects to have terminated upon Closing and Seller shall provide timely notices of termination;   provided  ,   however  , that Seller shall not terminate, and Buyer expressly agrees to assume, all Contracts that are not cancellable by their terms or which cannot be terminated without cost or penalty to Seller. At Closing, Seller shall assign and Buyer shall assume all Contracts that have not terminated as of the Closing Date, including without limitation, any remaining rights and obligations under Contracts under which the notice required to terminate such Contracts, though delivered, will not have run prior to Closing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all existing agreements for management of the Property shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, as well as any so-called  master  Contracts that pertain to multiple properties controlled by Seller and its affiliates. 
  (d)         Right of Termination  .  If Buyer determines that the Property is not suitable in Buyer s sole discretion, then Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller on or before 5:00 pm (Eastern) on the last day of the Inspection Period and this Agreement shall be null and void for all purposes (except for provisions that expressly survive hereunder) and the Deposit (less the Hard Deposit) shall be returned to Buyer. In the event that Buyer does not deliver notice of termination of this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate under this   Section 5(d)   and the Deposit shall be non-refundable to Buyer except in accordance with the terms of   Section 3(b)(ii)   above or a termination by Buyer where authorized under Section 13 or 14 of this Agreement.  
  6.         Condition of Title  .   
  (a)       Commitment to Insure  .  Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of Seller s Owner s Policy of title insurance and Buyer shall promptly order a commitment from the Title Company (the    Title Commitment   ) to provide a standard owner s title insurance policy for the Property in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (the    Title Policy    and (ii) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy the most recent ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey of the Property in Seller s possession, if any (the    Existing Survey   ).  Buyer, at its option and expense, may obtain a new survey, or an update of the Existing Survey of the Real Property (the    Survey   ).  
  (b)    During the Inspection Period, Buyer shall review title to the Real Property as disclosed by the Title Commitment and, if obtained, the Survey.  Seller shall have no obligation to cure title objections except to satisfy and remove liens of an ascertainable amount created by, through, or under Seller or its affiliates, which liens Seller shall cause to be released at the Closing or affirmatively insured over by the Title Company.  Seller further agrees to remove any exceptions or encumbrances to title which are created by Seller after the Effective Date of this Agreement without Buyer s written consent or which Seller commits in writing to cure (collectively with the liens addressed in the preceding sentence, the    Seller Cure Items   ).   
  
   5 
  LW:1034353.1 

Buyer may terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Deposit (less the Hard Deposit) at any time prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period or if the Title Company revises the Title Commitment after the expiration of the Inspection Period to add or modify exceptions in a material adverse manner, if such additions or modifications are not acceptable to Buyer and are not removed by the Closing Date.  Seller shall execute at Closing an affidavit as to authority, the rights of tenants in occupancy and the status of mechanics  liens (and sufficient to remove from the Title Policy any exception for mechanics  liens filed against the Real Property which relate to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date) in form acceptable to Seller as the Title Company shall require for the issuance of the Title Policy.  All matters to which exception is taken in the Title Commitment or any revision thereto, other than the Seller Cure Items, constitute the    Permitted Exceptions   .  Seller shall cause Title Company to be irrevocably committed at Closing to issue the Title Policy to Buyer, dated effective as of the date of Closing and subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.  With such a commitment, the Title Policy may be delivered after Closing if that is customary in the locality.        
  7.         Delivery of Possession  .  Actual sole and exclusive physical possession of the Property shall be given to Buyer at Closing unoccupied and free of any leases, claims to or rights of possession other than the rights of tenants under Leases by delivery of the keys to the Property and Seller s special or limited warranty deed (the    Deed   ) in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit B  , and Seller s bill of sale in the form of   Exhibit C   to this Agreement duly executed by Seller (the    Bill of Sale   ).   
  8.         Apportionments  .   All property related items of income and expense, including but not limited to the following, shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to the Closing Date (the    Pro Ration Date   ) as follows: 
  (a)         Taxes.       All real estate taxes, charges, and assessments affecting the Property (collectively,    Taxes   ) shall be prorated on a per diem basis as of the Pro Ration Date, applying any discount for early payment applicable as of the Pro Ration Date, and on the basis of the actual fiscal year for which such taxes are assessed, and Buyer shall assume liability for payment of Taxes accruing in the year in which Closing occurs.  In the event that the amount of Taxes for the current year is unknown at Closing, the Taxes shall be prorated based on the mill rate for taxes assessed for the immediately preceding year, taking into account the current appraised value for the Property issued by the County Appraisal District, and Buyer shall notify Seller of any necessary adjustment to such proration within thirty (30) days after when correct tax figures are known, and thereafter any necessary adjustments shall be made.  Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller has or may file appeals (the    Appeals   ) with respect to the current fiscal year and also with respect to prior year(s) ad valorem property taxes applicable to the Property (the    Appealed Taxes   ).  Seller shall be entitled, in Seller s sole discretion, to continue to pursue such Appeals after the Closing Date. In the event that any such Appeal is successful in reducing the amount of Appealed Taxes payable with respect to prior years, Seller shall be entitled to the full amount of any rebate, refund or reduction resulting from such Appeal.  In the event that any such Appeal is successful in reducing the amount of Appealed Taxes payable with respect to the current fiscal year, Seller and Buyer shall prorate the net proceeds of any rebate, refund or reduction resulting from such Appeal relating to the current fiscal year, after payment of Seller s third party costs incurred in connection with the Appeal. This paragraph shall expressly survive Closing and the recordation of the Deed. 
  (b)         Rents  .     Rents and other recurring income relating to the Property and collected by Seller for the month in which Closing occurs shall be deemed earned ratably on a per diem basis and shall be prorated  
  
   6 
  LW:1034353.1

Seller s approval of any assignment of Buyer s interest in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of Seller s right to approve any subsequent assignments. 
  Notwithstanding the terms of this Paragraph 20, Buyer shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate of Buyer.  For purposes hereof, an affiliate shall include (without limitation) (i) any entity in which the original Buyer, the principal of the original Buyer, or any entity owned or controlled by either of them, holds a direct or indirect ownership interest; and (ii) any Tenant-in-Common ownership structure where one or more of the parties to hold an ownership interest in the Property pursuant to such structure is the principal of the original Buyer named herein (or an entity controlled by such principal).  Buyer s right to assign this Agreement shall be subject to execution by Buyer and the assignee of a form of assignment agreement which provides that Buyer is not released from its obligations under this Agreement and under which such assignee assumes all of Buyer s obligations under this Agreement.  Buyer shall give notice of any such proposed assignment to Seller not less than five (5) business days prior to the scheduled the Closing Date.  Upon such assignment, the assignee shall succeed to all of the rights of Buyer under this Agreement (including without limitation Buyer s rights with respect to the Deposit) and shall assume all of Buyer s obligations under the Agreement.  No such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any liability under the Agreement in the event of a default by Buyer or its assignee.

If for the current ad valorem tax year the taxable value of the Property that is the subject of this Agreement is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for appraisal of the Property at less than its market value, the Buyer may not be allowed to qualify the Property for that special appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the Property may then be appraised at its full market value.  In addition, the transfer of the Property or a subsequent change in the use of the Property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer or the change in the use of the Property.  The taxable value of the Property and the applicable method of appraisal for the current tax year is public information and may be obtained from the Travis County Appraisal District. 
  (b)         Notice Regarding Possible Annexation  .  If the Property that is the subject of this Agreement is located outside the limits of a municipality, the Property may now or later be included in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality and may now or later be subject to annexation by the municipality.  Each municipality maintains a map that depicts its boundaries and extraterritorial jurisdiction.

  (c)         Property Located in a Certificated Service Area of a Utility Service Provider  .  The Property that you are about to purchase may be located in a certificated water or sewer service area, which is authorized by law to provide water or sewer service to the properties in the certificated area.  If the Property is  
  
   22 
  LW:1034353.1 

located in a certificated area there may be special costs or charges that you will be required to pay before you can receive water or sewer service.  There may be a period required to construct lines or other facilities necessary to provide water or sewer service to the Property.  You are advised to determine if the Property is in a certificated area and contact the utility service provider to determine the cost that you will be required to pay and the period, if any, that is required to provide water or sewer service to the Property. 
  (d)         Notice Regarding District  .  If the Property is situated in a utility or other statutorily created district providing water, sewer, drainage, or flood control facilities and services, Chapter 49, Texas Water Code, requires Seller to deliver and Buyer to sign the statutory notice relating to the tax rate, bonded indebtedness, or standby fees of the district before final execution of this Agreement. 
  (e)         Notice Regarding Coastal Property  .  If the Property adjoins or shares a common boundary with the tidally influenced submerged lands of the state, Section 33.135, Texas Natural Resources Code, requires a notice regarding coastal area property to be included as part of this Agreement. 
  (f)         Lead Disclosure  .  If apartments or other residential units are on the Property and the units were built before 1978, federal law requires a lead-based paint and hazard disclosure statement to be made part of this Agreement.

EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENTS MADE ABOVE AND THE FACT THAT EACH PARTY WAS REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO EXPLAINED, AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT WAS MADE, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION.

  2 

thirty (30) days after the scheduled Closing Date.

BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO FILE ANY LIS PENDENS OR ANY LIEN AGAINST ANY PROPERTY UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS FILED AN ACTION SEEKING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller's default constitutes an Intentional Seller Default (as hereinafter defined) and Buyer makes the election described in clause (a) above, then Buyer shall also have the right to sue Seller for money damages in an amount equal to the amount of the direct, third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the inspection, acquisition and financing of said Property up to a maximum amount of $100,000.  As used herein, "  Intentional Seller Default  " means any one or more of the following: (a) fraudulent misrepresentation, (b) criminal conduct (i.e. conduct that constitutes a felony under applicable law), or (c) an intentional and deliberate act of Seller taken on or after the Effective Date that is intended to result in, and does result in, Buyer's inability to consummate the transaction contemplated in this Agreement for a reason other than Buyer's default. 
  (c)        Upon Closing  .  If Closing is completed hereunder, the Deposit shall be reflected as a credit against the Purchase Price.   
  (d)        Upon Termination by Buyer  .

  (e)        Hard Deposit  .  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Hard Deposit shall be a  hard  deposit that is non-refundable to Buyer except as expressly set forth in this Section 3(e);   provided  ,   however  , that Buyer shall be entitled to a return by Seller of the Hard Deposit in the case of a termination by Buyer under Section 3(b)(ii) (Seller Default).  This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
  4.        Closing  .  The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property (the    Closing   ) shall take place on or before   September 21, 2016   or at earlier date as mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (the    Closing Date   ).

5.        Inspection and Title Review. 
    
  (a)        Inspection Period  .

Buyer shall bear the cost of all inspections and tests, and Buyer shall give reasonable notice to the management of any inspection or test to be conducted on the Property. Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds Seller and the Property harmless as to all loss, property damage, bodily injury, cost or expense resulting from Buyer s inspections and tests of the Property, including, without limitation, claims for services rendered by third parties conducting such inspections and tests.  Buyer shall also restore the Land and Improvements to the condition in which the same were found before any such entry upon the Property and inspection or examination was undertaken.  Such agreement to repair and restore, and to indemnify and hold harmless Seller shall expressly survive closing or any termination of the Agreement.  Buyer shall maintain, or shall cause its contractors to maintain, public liability and property damage insurance insuring Buyer (and naming Seller as an additional insured party) against any liability arising out of any entry or inspections of the Property or work performed about the Property pursuant to the provisions hereof and shall deliver certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage to Seller prior to any entry by Buyer or its contractors on the Property.   
    
  (b)        Document Review  .  Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (or make available for inspection at the Property) copies of the items listed on   Schedule 5(b)   attached hereto and made a part hereof, but only to the extent such items are in Seller s possession or control (collectively,    Documents    provided that Leases shall be available for inspection at the Property only.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, and shall have no liability with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information, data or conclusions contained in any information provided to Buyer, and Buyer shall make its own independent inquiry regarding the economic feasibility, physical condition and environmental state of the Property during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending at 5:00 pm (Eastern) on   August 15, 2016   (the    Inspection Period   ).  
  (c)        Assignment or Termination of Contracts  .  Buyer shall assume all Contracts at Closing subject to this   Section 5(c)  .  Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer may advise Seller in writing of any Contracts that it elects to have terminated upon Closing and Seller shall provide timely notices of termination;   provided  ,   however  , that Seller shall not terminate, and Buyer expressly agrees to assume, all Contracts that are not cancellable by their terms or which cannot be terminated without cost or penalty to Seller. At Closing, Seller shall assign and Buyer shall assume all Contracts that have not terminated as of the Closing Date, including without limitation, any remaining rights and obligations under Contracts under which the notice required to terminate such Contracts, though delivered, will not have run prior to Closing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all existing agreements for management of the Property shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. 
  (d)        Right of Termination  .

A subsequent cash adjustment of RUBS between Seller and Buyer will be made when actual figures are available, but in all events within 90 days after the Closing Date.  Seller and Buyer each agree to provide such information as the other may reasonably request regarding RUBS and the billing, collection, and payment thereof. This provision shall expressly survive Closing and the recordation of the Deed.

Confidential Information    means the terms of this Agreement and all due diligence information (including the Documents) provided to Buyer by Seller other than information of public record or generally known to the public.  Buyer will destroy any electronic or paper documents constituting the Confidential Information, or return it to Seller if appropriate, if the Closing does not occur or this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or Seller before Closing.  The confidentiality provisions of this   Section 18   shall not apply to any disclosures made by Buyer as required by law, by court order, or in connection with any subpoena served upon Buyer; provided Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice before making any such disclosure.  Buyer s obligations under this Section 18 shall survive termination of this Agreement.   
    
  2.        No Other Representations  .  Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor anyone acting, or purporting to act, on behalf of Seller, has, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, made any representation or warranty with respect to the Property. 
    
  3.        Assignability  .  Buyer shall not have the right to assign its interest in this Agreement without Seller s advance written consent, which consent may be withheld in Seller s sole and absolute discretion.  Buyer hereby agrees that any assignment by Buyer, if consented to by Seller, shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations and liabilities hereunder.  Additionally, it shall be a condition of any such assignment that the assignee assumes, in a written instrument delivered to Seller (in form and content reasonably acceptable to Seller), all obligations of Buyer hereunder.  Seller s approval of any assignment of Buyer s interest in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of Seller s right to approve any subsequent assignments. 
  Notwithstanding the terms of this Paragraph 20, Buyer shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate of Buyer.  Buyer s right to assign this Agreement shall be subject to execution by Buyer and the assignee of a form of assignment agreement acceptable to Seller.  Buyer shall give notice of any such proposed assignment to Seller not less than five (5) business days prior to the scheduled the Closing Date.  Upon such assignment, the assignee shall succeed to all of the rights of Buyer under this Agreement (including without limitation Buyer s rights with respect to the Deposit) and shall assume all of Buyer s obligations under the Agreement.  No such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any liability under the Agreement in the event of a default by Buyer or its assignee.
