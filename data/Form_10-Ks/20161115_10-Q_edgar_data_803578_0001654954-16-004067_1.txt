NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.             

  Basis
of Presentation 

Organization and Business 

Founded
in 1979, Information Analysis Incorporated ( We , the
 Company ), to which we sometimes refer as IAI, is in
the business of developing and maintaining information technology
(IT) systems, modernizing client information systems, and
performing professional services to government and commercial
organizations. We presently concentrate our technology, services
and experience to developing web-based and mobile device solutions
(including electronic forms conversions), data analytics, cyber
security applications, and legacy software migration and
modernization for various agencies of the federal government. We
provide software and services to government and commercial
customers throughout the United States, with a concentration in the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the
instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). In the opinion of management, the unaudited
financial statements include all adjustments necessary (which are
of a normal and recurring nature) for the fair and not misleading
presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. These
unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with
our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the
Company with the SEC on March 29, 2016 (the  Annual
Report ). The accompanying December 31, 2015 balance sheet
and financial information was derived from our audited financial
statements included in the Annual Report. The results of operations
for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations for any other interim period or for a full
fiscal year. 

There
have been no changes in the Company s significant accounting
policies as of September 30, 2016 as compared to the significant
accounting policies disclosed in Note 1, "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that was filed with the
SEC on March 29, 2016. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results can, and in many cases will,
differ from those estimates.  

Income Taxes 

As of
September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the
Company s uncertain tax position disclosures as provided in
Note 7 of the Annual Report. The Company does not anticipate that
total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change prior to
September 30, 2017. 

2.             

  Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), or other standard
setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the specified
effective date. 

In May
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2014-09,  "Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606)"  ( ASU
2014-09 ) .  This new
standard will supercede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance in U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the ASU is that an
entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or
services equal to the amount it expects to receive for those goods
and services. The standard defines a five step process to achieve
this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment
and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition
process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including
identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the
amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction
price and allocating the transaction price to each separate
performance obligation. The standard allows entities to apply
either of two adoption methods: (a) retrospective application to
each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect
certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (b)
retrospective application with the cumulative effect of initially
applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application
and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU
2014-09. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Topic 606   ("ASU 2015-14"), which defers the effective
date for ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard
on its financial statements and the method of
adoption. 

7 

There
have been three new ASUs issued amending certain aspects of ASU
2014-09. ASU 2016-08, " Principal
versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus
Net) ," was issued in March 2016 to clarify certain aspects
of the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09. In addition,
ASU 2016-10,  "Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing"  issued in April 2016,
amends other sections of ASU 2014-09 including clarifying guidance
related to identifying performance obligations and licensing
implementation. Finally, ASU 2016-12,  "Revenue from Contracts with Customers -
Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients"  provides
amendments and practical expedients to the guidance in ASU 2014-09
in the areas of assessing collectability, presentation of sales
taxes received from customers, noncash consideration, contract
modification and clarification of using the full retrospective
approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. With its evaluation of the impact of
ASU 2014-09, the Company will also consider the impact related to
the updated guidance provided by these three new ASUs. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases: Topic 842,   which
provided updated guidance on lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within that annual period, with
early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of
adopting this new standard on its financial
statements. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The
update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with
early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must
adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related
to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum
statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic
value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition
method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of
the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.
Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on
the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to
meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be
applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the
practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied
prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related
to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash
flows using either a prospective transition method or a
retrospective transition method. The Company is required to adopt
ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, and is currently
assessing the impact of this pronouncement on its financial
statements. 

3.             

  Stock-Based
Compensation 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had three
stock-based compensation plans. The 1996 Stock Option Plan was
adopted in 1996 ( 1996 Plan ) and had options granted
under it through May 29, 2006. The last of the options granted
under the 1996 Plan expired on May 18, 2016. The 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan was adopted in 2006 ( 2006 Plan ) and
had options granted under it through April 12, 2016. On June 1,
2016, the shareholders ratified the IAI 2016 Stock Incentive Plan
( 2016 Plan ), which had been approved by the Board of
Directors on April 4, 2016. 

Total
compensation expense related to these plans was $2,857 and $2,112
for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
none of which related to options awarded to non-employees. Total
compensation expense related to these plans was $8,329 and $7,826
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, none of which related to options awarded to
non-employees. The Company estimates the fair value of options
granted using a Black-Scholes valuation model to establish the
expense. When stock-based compensation is awarded to employees, the
expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. When
stock-based compensation is awarded to non-employees, the expense
is recognized over the period of performance. 

8 

The
fair values of option awards granted in the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following
assumptions: 

2016 Stock Incentive Plan 

The
2016 Plan became effective June 1, 2016, and expires April 4, 2026.
The 2016 Plan provides for the granting of equity awards to key
employees, including officers and directors. The maximum number of
shares for which equity awards may be granted under the 2016 Plan
is 1,000,000. Options under the 2016 Plan expire no later than ten
years from the date of grant or when employment ceases, whichever
comes first, and vest over periods determined by the Board of
Directors. The minimum exercise price of each option is the quoted
market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant. At
September 30, 2016, there were no options yet issued under the 2016
Plan. 

2006 Stock Incentive Plan 

The
2006 Plan became effective May 18, 2006, and expired April 12,
2016. The 2006 Plan provides for the granting of equity awards to
key employees, including officers and directors. The maximum number
of shares for which equity awards could be granted under the 2006
Plan was 1,950,000. Options under the 2006 Plan expire no later
than ten years from the date of grant or when employment ceases,
whichever comes first, and vest over periods determined by the
Board of Directors. There were 1,193,500 and 992,500 unexpired
exercisable options remaining from the 2006 Plan at September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

1996 Stock Option Plan 

The
1996 Plan provided for the granting of options to purchase shares
of our common stock to key employees, including officers and
directors. The maximum number of shares for which options could be
granted under the 1996 Plan was 3,075,000. Options expired no later
than ten years from the date of grant or when employment ceases,
whichever came first, and vested over periods determined by the
Board of Directors. There were zero and 98,000 unexpired
exercisable options remaining from the 1996 Plan at September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The
status of the options issued as of September 30, 2016 and changes
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as
follows: 

9 

The
following tables summarize information about options at September
30, 2016: 

Nonvested option
awards as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

As of  September 30, 2016  and 2015, unrecognized compensation cost 
associated with non-vested share-based compensation totaled $1,378
and $1,846, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over
weighted average periods of four months and five months,
respectively. 

10 

4.             

  Loss
Per Share 

Basic
loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing loss
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock, except for periods when the Company reports a net
loss because the inclusion of such items would be
antidilutive. 

The
following is a reconciliation of the amounts used in calculating
basic and diluted net loss per common share: 

5.             

  Financial
Instruments 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most
advantageous market in an orderly transaction. To increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, the FASB
established a three-level hierarchy which requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of
fair value measurements are: 

Level
1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1
inputs. 

Level
2 Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on
active markets, but corroborated by market data. 

Level
3 Unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market
data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest
priority to Level 3 inputs. 

The inputs used in measuring the fair value of cash and cash
equivalents are considered to be Level 1 in accordance with the
three-tier fair value hierarchy. The fair market values are based
on period-end statements supplied by the various banks and brokers
that held the majority of the Company s funds. The fair value
of short-term financial instruments (primarily cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other
current assets and liabilities) approximate their carrying values
because of their short-term nature.

Item
2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations 

Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements regarding our
business, customer prospects, or other factors that may affect
future earnings or financial results that are subject to the safe
harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties which could
cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. Investors should read and understand
the risk factors detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 10-K ) and
in other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

We
operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
risks, some of which are beyond our control. This list highlights
some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These
are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for
you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently
known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are
similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or
business in general, may also impair our business operations. If
any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our
business, financial condition and operating results would likely
suffer. These risks include, among others, the
following: 

changes in the
funding priorities of the U.S. federal government; 

changes in the way
the U.S. federal government contracts with businesses; 

terms specific to
U.S. federal government contracts; 

our failure to keep
pace with a changing technological environment; 

intense competition
from other companies; 

inaccuracy in our
estimates of the cost of services and the timeline for completion
of contracts; 

non-performance by
our subcontractors and suppliers; 

our dependence on
third-party software and software maintenance
suppliers; 

our failure to
adequately integrate businesses we may acquire; 

fluctuations in our
results of operations and the resulting impact on our stock
price; 

the limited public
market for our common stock; 

changes in the
economic health of our non U.S. federal government customers;
and 

our forward-looking
statements and projections may prove to be inaccurate. 

In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as
 may,   will,   should, 
 could,   would,   expect, 
 plans,   anticipates, 
 believes,   estimates, 
 projects,   predicts, 
 intends,   potential  and similar
expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
statements reflect our current views with respect to future events
and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and
uncertainties. Given these uncertainties, you should not place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We discuss many
of these risks in greater detail under the heading  Risk
Factors  in Item 1A of our 2015 10-K. Also, these
forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions
only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we
assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after
the date of this report. 

Our Business 

Founded
in 1979, IAI is in the business of modernizing client information
systems, developing and maintaining information technology systems,
developing electronic forms, and performing consulting services to
government and commercial organizations. We have performed software
conversion projects for over 100 commercial and government
customers, including Computer Sciences Corporation, IBM, Computer
Associates, Sprint, Citibank, U.S. Department of Homeland Security,
U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S.
Department of Education, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Army, U.S.
Air Force, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Today, we primarily apply our
technology, services and experience to legacy software migration
and modernization for commercial companies and government agencies,
and to developing web-based solutions for agencies of the U.S.
federal government. 

Over
the last eighteen months, to improve our prospects for growth, we
have added two members to our board of directors, William Pickle
and Mark Krial, and the Neo4j graph database software to our
General Services Administration Schedule 70 contract. 

In the
three months ended September 30, 2016, our prime contracts with
U.S. government agencies generated 77.2% of our revenue,
subcontracts under federal procurements generated 9.2% of our
revenue and 13.6% of our revenue came from commercial contracts.
The terms of these contracts and subcontracts vary from single
transactions to five years. Within the group of prime contracts
with U.S. government agencies, three individual contracts generated
16.2%, 10.4% and 9.3% of our total revenue,
respectively. 

12 

In the
same period in 2015, our prime contracts with U.S. government
agencies generated 66.6% of our revenue, subcontracts under federal
procurements generated 21.2% of our revenue, 11.7% of our revenue
came from commercial contracts, and 0.5% of our revenue came from
state and local government contracts. The terms of these contracts
and subcontracts varied from single transactions to five years.
Within the group of prime contracts with U.S. government agencies,
two individual contracts generated 24.8% and 20.7% of our revenue,
respectively. One customer under which we subcontract for multiple
U.S. government agencies accounted for 12.6% of our revenue. One
commercial customer generated 11.2% of our revenue. 

In the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, our prime contracts with U.S.
government agencies generated 73.7% of our revenue, subcontracts
under federal procurements generated 12.6% of our revenue, and
13.7% of our revenue came from commercial contracts. The terms of
these contracts and subcontracts vary from single transactions to
five years. Within this group of prime contracts with U.S.
government agencies, two individual contracts generated 18.5% and
11.4% of our revenue, respectively. One commercial customer
generated 9.0% of our revenue. 

In the
same nine month period in 2015, our prime contracts with U.S.
government agencies generated 61.6% of our revenue, subcontracts
under federal procurements generated 25.8% of our revenue, 12.3% of
our revenue came from commercial contracts, and 0.3% of our revenue
came from state and local government contracts. The terms of these
contracts and subcontracts varied from single transactions to five
years. Within this group of prime contracts with U.S. government
agencies, two contracts generated 21.3% and 17.5% of our revenue,
respectively. One customer under which we subcontract for multiple
U.S. government agencies accounted for 13.4% of our revenue. One
commercial customer accounted for 11.6% of our
revenue. 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus Three Months Ended September
30, 2015 

Revenue 

Our
revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $2,031,553 compared to
$1,458,889 in the corresponding quarter in 2015, an increase of
$572,664, or 39.3%. Professional fees revenue was $885,505 versus
$1,217,234, a decrease of 27.3%, and software revenue was
$1,146,048 versus $241,655, an increase of 374.2%. There were
several offsetting increases and decreases in activity under
continuing professional fees contracts, as well as new and expiring
prime contracts and subcontracts. The decrease in our professional
fees revenue is primarily due to the completion of projects prior
to third quarter 2016 under two contracts. The increase in our
software revenue in 2016 versus the same period in 2015 is due to
several U.S. federal government agency orders for Adobe and Micro
Focus licenses and an increase in referral fees earned for
facilitating sales directly from our suppliers to customers we
introduced. Software sales and associated margins are subject to
considerable fluctuation from period to period, based on the
product mix sold and referral fees earned. Over the last four
years, we have experienced an increase in the quantity of software
product orders in the third quarter as the U.S. federal government
fiscal year comes to a close. 

Gross Profit 

Gross
profit was $556,085, or 27.4% of revenue in the third quarter of
2016 versus $444,257, or 30.5% of revenue in the third quarter of
2015. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, $416,949 of the
gross profit was attributable to professional fees at a gross
profit percentage of 47.1%, and $139,136 of the gross profit was
attributable to software sales at a gross profit percentage of
12.1%. In the same quarter in 2015, we reported gross profit for
professional fees of $429,168, or 35.3%, of professional fee
revenue, and gross profit of $15,089, or 6.2% of software sales.
Gross profit from professional fees decreased with the decrease in
revenue, yet gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased due
to the timing of revenue recognition of certain fixed price
contracts. In the third quarter of 2015 we had a fixed price
contract that was affected negatively by timing, accumulating
direct costs without certainty of achieving billable deliverables.
That revenue was ultimately recognized in the fourth quarter of
2015. Gross profit on software sales increased in terms of dollars
due to the increase in sales and to an increase in the third
quarter of 2016 over the third quarter of 2015 in referral fees for
facilitating third-party sales, for which there were no direct
costs incurred by us. The increase in gross profit percentage is
due exclusively to the increase in referral fees. Software product
sales and associated margins are subject to considerable
fluctuation from period to period, based on the product mix sold
and referral fees earned. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses, exclusive of sales commissions, were
$428,852, or 21.1% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2016 versus
$434,954, or 29.8% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2015. These
expenses decreased $6,102, or 1.4%, from the third quarter of
2015. 

13 

Commission expense
was $187,030, or 9.2% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2016
versus $109,630, or 7.5% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2015.
This increase of $77,400, or 70.6%, is due to increases in gross
profits on commissionable professional services contracts, which
drive commission earned at varying rates for each salesperson, and
an increase in referral fees earned for facilitating sales directly
from our suppliers to customers we introduced, for which there are
little to no direct costs. 

Net loss 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $57,238, or
2.8% of revenue, versus net loss of $97,742, or 6.7% of revenue,
for the same period in 2015. 

Nine
months Ended September 30, 2016 versus Nine months Ended September
30, 2015 

Revenue 

Our
revenues in the first nine months of 2016 were $5,322,573 compared
to $4,244,885 in 2015, an increase of $1,077,688, or 25.4%.
Professional fees revenue was $2,655,006 versus $3,329,766, a
decrease of 20.3%, and software revenue was $2,667,567 versus
$915,119, an increase of 191.5%. The decrease in our professional
fees revenue is primarily due to the expiration of two U.S. federal
government prime short-term contracts and several subcontracts that
were active in the first nine months of 2015. In addition, there
were several offsetting increases and decreases in activity under
continuing contracts. The increase in our software revenue in 2016
versus the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a few larger
U.S. federal government agency orders for Adobe and Micro Focus
licenses and software maintenance, and an increase in referral fees
earned for facilitating sales directly from our suppliers to
customers we introduced. Software sales and associated margins are
subject to considerable fluctuation from period to period, based on
the product mix sold and referral fees earned. 

Gross Profit 

Gross
profit was $1,439,504, or 27.0% of revenue in the first nine months
of 2016 versus $1,364,715, or 32.1% of revenue in the first nine
months of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
$1,145,725 of the gross profit was attributable to professional
fees at a gross profit percentage of 43.2%, and $293,779 of the
gross profit was attributable to software sales at a gross profit
percentage of 11.0%. In the same period in 2015, we reported gross
profit for professional fees of $1,306,157, or 39.2% of
professional fees revenue and $58,558, for software sales, or 6.4%
of software sales. Gross profit from professional fees decreased
with the decrease in revenue, yet gross profit as a percentage of
revenue increased due to the timing of revenue recognition of
certain fixed price contracts. In 2015 we had a fixed price
contract that was affected negatively by timing, accumulating
direct costs without certainty of achieving billable deliverables.
That revenue was ultimately recognized in the fourth quarter of
2015. Gross profit on software sales increased in terms of dollars
due to the increase in sales and to an increase in the first nine
months of 2016 over the first nine months of 2015 in referral fees
for facilitating third-party sales, for which there were no direct
costs incurred by us. The increase in gross profit percentage is
due exclusively to the increase in referral fees. There has been
considerable downward pressure on margins for software sales over
the last few years due to the use by U.S. federal government
agencies of new bidding processes such as reverse auctions.
Software product sales and associated margins are subject to
considerable fluctuation from period to period, based on the
product mix sold and referral fees earned. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses, exclusive of sales commissions, were
$1,451,423, or 27.3% of revenues, in the first nine months of 2016
versus $1,301,322, or 30.7% of revenues, in the first nine months
of 2015. These expenses increased $150,101, or 11.5%. Since the
first nine months of 2015, we have added an additional member of
our sales staff, experienced increases in the costs of providing
health insurance and other fringe benefits to our employees,
incurred expenses for training our staff in programming and on the
latest developments in supporting the third party software we sell,
experienced increases in legal expenses with regard to contracts,
utilized more labor in developing our bids and proposals for new
contracts, and have increased certain aspects of our business
insurance coverage. 

Commission expense
was $408,695, or 7.7% of revenues, in the first nine months of 2016
versus $349,295, or 8.2% of revenues, in the first nine months of
2015. This increase of $59,400, or 17.0%, is due to increases in
gross profits on commissionable professional services contracts,
which drive commission earned at varying rates for each
salesperson, and an increase in referral fees earned for
facilitating sales directly from our suppliers to customers we
introduced, for which there are little to no direct
costs. 

Net loss 

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $413,265, or
7.8% of revenue, versus net loss of $278,222, or 6.6% of revenue,
for the same period in 2015. 

14 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash and cash equivalents balance, when combined with our cash flow
from operations during the first nine months of 2016, were
sufficient to provide financing for our operations. Our net cash
provided by the combination of our operating and investing
activities in the first nine months of 2016 was $629,609. This net
cash provided, when added to a beginning balance of $2,167,928,
yielded cash and cash equivalents of $2,797,537 as of September 30,
2016. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $105,775
due to the allocation over time of prepaid expenses associated with
the maintenance contracts on software sales. Deferred revenue
decreased $117,248 due to the recognition of revenue over time from
maintenance contracts on software sales. Accounts payable, accrued
payroll and accrued expenses increased $1,086,156 due to the timing
of product and maintenance orders placed by our U.S. federal
government customers immediately before their fiscal year end of
September 30, and commissions payable decreased $51,528. We had no
non-current liabilities as of September 30, 2016. 

We have
a revolving line of credit with a bank providing for demand or
short-term borrowings of up to $1,000,000. The line became
effective December 20, 2005, and expires on May 31, 2017. As of
September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under this line of
credit. 

Given
our current cash position and operating plan, we anticipate that we
will be able to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve
months. 

We
presently lease our corporate offices on a contractual basis with
certain timeframe commitments and obligations. We believe that our
existing offices will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable
facility requirement. Should we need additional space to
accommodate increased activities, management believes we can secure
such additional space on reasonable terms. 

We have
no material commitments for capital expenditures. 

We have
no off-balance sheet arrangements.

  Controls
and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and people
performing similar functions, has evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act), as of September 30, 2016 (the  Evaluation Date ).
Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date,
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and
(ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure .  

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over
financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no control
system can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of a person, by collusion of
two or more people or by management override of the control. The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the
inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be
detected. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
