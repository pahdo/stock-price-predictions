NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

SilverSun Technologies, Inc. (the  Company ) through its wholly owned subsidiary SWK Technologies, Inc. ( SWK ) is a value added reseller and master developer for Sage Software s Sage100/500 and ERP X3 financial and accounting software as well as the publisher of proprietary software solutions, including its own Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) software,  MAPADOC.   The Company is also a managed network service provider, providing remote network monitoring services, business continuity, disaster recovery, data backup, and application hosting. The Company sells services and products to various industries including, but not limited to, manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors located throughout the United States. The Company is publicly traded and is currently quoted on the Over-the-Counter Market Place ( OTCQB ) under the symbol  SSNT. 

In 2015, the Company completed four additional acquisitions, 2000 SOFT, d/b/a Accounting Technology Resources ( ATR ), a Southern California based reseller of Sage Software applications, ProductiveTech, Inc. ( PTI ) located in Southern New Jersey, The Macabe Associates, Inc., ( Macabe ) a Washington based reseller of Sage Software and Acumatica applications, and Oates   Company, ( Oates ) a North Carolina reseller of Sage Software applications.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SilverSun Technologies, Inc. as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

The financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC) and consequently have been condensed and do not include all of the disclosures normally made in an Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The December 31, 2015 balance sheet included herein was derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the financial statements included herein should be reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.

On February 4, 2015 the Company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of the outstanding common stock (the  Reverse Stock Split ) whereby every thirty (30) shares of outstanding common stock decreased to one (1) share of common stock. Similarly, the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 ( Common Stock ) into which each outstanding option and warrant to purchase common stock is to be exercisable decreased on a 1-for-30 basis and the exercise price of each outstanding option and warrant to purchase common stock increased proportionately. The impact of this Reverse Stock Split has been retroactively applied to the financial statements and the related notes.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies than those previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Principles of Consolidation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SilverSun and its subsidiary SWK, which is wholly owned. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Goodwill 

Goodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. These indicators may include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. No impairment losses were identified or recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Definite Lived Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets 

The purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value using an independent valuation at the date of acquisition and are amortized over the useful lives of the asset using the straight-line amortization method. 

The Company assesses potential impairment of its intangible assets and other long-lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. No impairment losses were identified or recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue is recognized when products are shipped, or services are rendered, evidence of a contract exists, the price is fixed or reasonably determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.

Product Revenue

Software product revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer. The Company treats the software component and the professional services consulting component as two separate arrangements that represent separate units of accounting. Consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based upon that unit s proportion of the fair value.  In a situation where both components are present, software sales revenue is recognized when collectability is reasonably assured and the product is delivered and has stand-alone value based upon vendor specific objective evidence.

Service Revenue

Service revenue is comprised of primarily professional service consulting revenue, maintenance revenue and other ancillary services provided. Professional service revenue is recognized as service time is incurred.

With respect to maintenance services, upon the completion of one year from the date of sale, the Company offers customers an optional annual software maintenance and support agreement for subsequent periods not exceeding one year. Maintenance and support agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the respective terms of the agreements, which typically range from three months to one year and are included in services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are classified as revenue, and the shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of sales.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Unbilled Services 

The Company recognizes revenue on its professional services as those services are performed or certain obligations are met. Unbilled services represent the revenue recognized but not yet invoiced. 

Deferred Revenues   

Deferred revenues consist of maintenance service, customer support services, including telephone support and deposits for future consulting services which will be earned as services are performed over the contractual or stated period, which generally ranges from three to twelve months.

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to federally insured limits. At times balances may exceed FDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

Concentrations   

The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with various institutions, which exceed federally insured limits throughout the year.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had cash on deposit of approximately $1,174,469 and $895,727 respectively in excess of the federally insured limits of $250,000.

As of September 30, 2016, no one customer represented more than 10% of the total accounts receivable and unbilled services.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our top ten customers accounted for 20% ($5,148,867) and 17% ($3,250,700), respectively, of our total revenues.  The Company does not rely on any one specific customer for any significant portion of our revenue. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, purchases from one supplier through a  channel partner  agreement were approximately 24% and 24% of cost of revenues, respectively.  This channel partner agreement is for a one year term and automatically renews for an additional one year term on the anniversary of the agreements effective date.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, one supplier represented approximately 39% and 33% of total accounts payable respectively.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company believes it has no significant risk related to its concentration of accounts receivable.

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable consist primarily of invoices for maintenance and professional services. Full payment for software ordered by customers is due in advance of ordering from the software supplier. Payments for maintenance and support plan renewals are due before the beginning of the maintenance period. Terms under our professional service agreements are generally 50% due in advance and the balance on completion of the services. 

The Company maintains an allowance for bad debt estimated by considering a number of factors, including the length of time the amounts are past due, the Company s previous loss history and the customer s current ability to pay its obligations.

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years.  Maintenance and repairs that do not materially add to the value of the equipment nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred.

When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting, or according to the expected reversal dates of the specific temporary differences, if not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company has federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards which are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. Tax years 2013 to 2016 remain open to examination for both the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.

There were no liabilities for uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Fair Value Measurement 

The accounting standards define fair value and establish a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use on unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is as follows:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.

Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.  

The Company s current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature and include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities.  The carrying value of longer term lease, contingent consideration and debt obligations approximate fair value as their stated interest rates approximate the rates currently available.

Stock-Based Compensation 

Compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value. The grant date fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton ( Black-Scholes ) pricing model. For employee stock options, the Company recognizes expense over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The Company s option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these subjective assumptions may significantly impact stock-based compensation expense.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets by recognizing a lessee s rights and obligations, while expenses will continue to be recognized in a similar manner to today s legacy lease accounting guidance. This ASU could also significantly affect the financial ratios used for external reporting and other purposes, such as debt covenant compliance.  This ASU will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including   treatment of excess tax benefits and forfeitures, as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The ASU will take effect for   public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted in any   interim or annual period. The Company is evaluating the future impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying performance obligations and licensing,  to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the guidance on identifying promised goods or services around identifying performance obligations and implementation guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor have they determined the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.

No other recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3   NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE   

The Company s basic income per common share is based on net income for the relevant period, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted income per common share is based on net income, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including common share equivalents, such as outstanding option and warrants to the extent they are dilutive. The computation of diluted income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 does not include share equivalents as all warrants and options exceeded the average market price of our common stock. Convertible debt is included below, based on the if-converted method.

Intangible assets consist of proprietary developed software, intellectual property, customer lists and acquired contracts carried at cost less accumulated amortization and customer lists acquired at fair value less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.

The components of intangible assets are as follows:

Amortization expense included in depreciation and amortization was $113,086 and $339,258 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively as compared to $145,708 and $300,010 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Included in proprietary developed software is $133,044 not yet in service.

The Company expects future amortization expense to be the following:

NOTE 6   LINE OF CREDIT AND PROMISSORY NOTES 

On August 1, 2013, the Company obtained a line of credit (the  Credit Line ) from the bank which expired on July 31, 2015 and was automatically renewed for an additional year. The Credit Line includes a borrowing base calculation tied to accounts receivable with a maximum availability of $750,000, interest is charged at prime plus 1.75% (5.25% at June 30, 2016).  The Credit Line is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and guaranteed by the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Meller.  The Credit Line requires the Company to pay a monitoring fee of $1,000 monthly. The Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Line at June 30, 2016. The line of credit was cancelled on July 31, 2016.

Options

The Company estimated the fair value of each option using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0.0%, risk-free interest rate of 1.6%, volatility at 263.18% and an expected life of 5 years. As a result, the Company estimated the value of these options at $39,875.

As a result, the Company estimated the value of these options at $91,482.

The following unaudited pro forma information does not purport to present what the Company s actual results would have been had the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015, nor is the financial information indicative of the results of future operations. The following table represents the unaudited consolidated pro forma results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as if the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015. Operating expenses have been increased for the amortization expense associated with the estimated fair value adjustment of definite lived intangible assets.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the pro-forma results above include two months of pro-forma results of ATR, six months of pro-forma results for PTI, nine months of pro-forma results for Macabe, and nine months of pro-forma results for Oates. 

NOTE 10   INCOME TAXES 

The recognized deferred tax asset is based upon the expected utilization of its benefit from future taxable income. The Company has federal net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards of approximately $7,523,000 as of December 31, 2015, of which approximately $614,000 is reserved, as of September 30, 2016, which is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These carryforward losses are available to offset future taxable income, and begin to expire in the year 2026 to 2034. 

The foregoing amounts are management s estimates and the actual results could differ from those estimates. Future profitability in this competitive industry depends on continually obtaining and fulfilling new profitable sales agreements and modifying products.  The inability to obtain new profitable contracts could reduce estimates of future profitability, which could affect the Company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets.

NOTE 10   INCOME TAXES (Continued) 

For the year nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s Federal and State provision requirements were calculated based on the estimated tax rate. The Federal effective rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to Incentive Stock Options (ISO) expense which is generally never tax deductible for the Company. The benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,282,380. The effective tax rate prior to the release of the valuation allowance consists primarily of the 40% federal statutory tax rate and a blended 5% state and local tax rate.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s Federal and State provision requirements were offset by the reversal of a significant portion of its valuation allowance, no longer deemed necessary, taking into consideration Section 382 limitations, to offset current and future taxable income totaling $6,909,093 and recorded a net tax benefit of $2,563,637, which represents a reduction in its valuation allowance on tax attributes that are expected to be utilized based on management s assessment and evaluation of current and projected income. Additionally the return to provision true-up of prior year taxes owed was a result of overaccrual of taxes for the 2015 tax year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s Federal and State provision requirements were offset by the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance totaling $560,000, no longer deemed necessary, and recorded a net tax benefit of $200,000.

In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company continued to expand its customer base and maintain its growth trend which we believe will provide a basis for future growth.

1) 
 
 Revenues increased 32% from the same nine months period in the prior year.

Revenues

Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2,334,309 (32.4%) to $9,534,092 and $6,266,967 (32.0%) to $25,881,283 respectively as compared to $7,199,783 and $19,614,316 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively.

The overall increases are primarily due to the Company s continued sales and marketing efforts and increased business activity associated with the acquisitions the Company completed in 2015.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $648,361 (22.3%) to $3,553,368 as compared to $2,905,007 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

The gross profit attributed to software sales increased $368,884 to $824,130 for the three months ending September 30, 2016 from $455,246 in the three months ending September 30, 2015 while gross profit attributed to software sales increased $96,072 to $1,782,074 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 from $1,686,002 in the nine months ending September 30, 2015.  This increase is a function of higher software sales in the nine month period ending September 30, 2016. The mix of products being sold by the Company changes from time to time and sometimes causes the overall gross margin percentage to vary.

The gross profit attributed to services increased $279,478 for the three months ending September 30, 2016 from the three months ending September 30, 2015 while gross profit attributed to services increased $1,622,671 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 from the nine months ending September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to the continued implementations of larger scale ERP systems.

Operating Expenses  

Selling and marketing expenses decreased $81,246 (6.5%) to $1,172,956 for the three months ending September 30, 2016 from $1,254,202 in the three months ending September 30, 2015. Selling and marketing expenses increased $252,475 (8.2%) to $3,348,476 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,096,001 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is due to increased sales personnel and travel expenses as a result of an increase in sales activity. 

General and administrative expenses increased $292,295 (20.7%) to $1,702,110 for the three months ending September 30, 2016 from $1,409,815 in the three months ending September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses increased $948,112 (24.5%) to $4,811,844 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $3,863,732 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is primarily as a result of increases in payroll and related expenses associated with the addition of management personnel and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of ATR, PTI, Macabe and Oates. 

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $13,319 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $171,308 as compared to $184,627 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $96,830 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $513,766 as compared to $416,936 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily attributed to the increase in amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired from the ATR, PTI, Macabe, and Oates acquisitions in 2015.

Income from Operations  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had income from operations of $502,247 and $1,132,018 respectively as compared to income from operations of $48,348 and $690,391, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase for the three months ended in September 30, 2016 is primarily due to higher software sales and higher revenue from consulting services. 

Income Taxes  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s Federal and State provision requirements were calculated based on the estimated tax rate. The Federal effective rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to Incentive Stock Options (ISO) expense which is generally never tax deductible for the Company. The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,282,380.  The effective tax rate consists primarily of the 40% federal statutory tax rate and a blended 5% state and local tax rate. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s Federal and State provision requirements were offset by the reversal of a significant portion of its valuation allowance, no longer deemed necessary, taking into consideration Section 382 limitations, to offset current and future taxable income totaling $6,909,093 and recorded a net tax benefit of $2,563,637, which represents a reduction in its valuation allowance on tax attributes that are expected to be utilized based on management s assessment and evaluation of current and projected income. Additionally the return to provision true-up of prior year taxes owed was a result of overaccrual of taxes for the 2015 tax year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company s Federal and State provision requirements were offset by the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance totaling $560,000, no longer deemed necessary, and recorded a net tax benefit of $200,000.

Net Income  

For the three and nine months September 30, 2016, the Company had net income of $2,751,406 and $3,372,803 respectively as compared to a net income of $16,464 and $582,232 respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the tax benefit of the valuation allowance release of $2,563,637, the net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is up compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the increased sales and consulting activities noted above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We are currently seeking additional operating income opportunities through potential acquisitions or investments. Such acquisitions or investments may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net increase in cash of $517,106.  The Company s principal sources and uses of funds were as follows:

Cash provided by (used in) operating activities

The Company generated $1,516,191 in cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to used cash of $106,164 for operating activities for the same period in 2015. This increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in deferred revenue and a decrease in income tax payable.

Cash used in investing activities

Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 used cash of $309,872. This use of cash is attributed to purchases of property and equipment and costs related to the internal development of software.

Cash used in financing activities

Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 used cash of $689,213 as compared to generating cash of $543,503 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the payment of a cash dividend of $264,699 in 2016 and $812,023 provided by an equity raise in prior year.

The Company believes that as a result of the growth in business, and the availability of its Credit Line, it has adequate liquidity to fund its operating plans for at least the next twelve months.

There was no significant impact on the Company s operations as a result of inflation for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ) and Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s PEO and PFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to our limited finance staff, and the ineffective management review of complex transactions   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s PEO and PFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Notwithstanding the material weakness, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2016 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Remediation

We are currently in the process of executing a plan of action to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. However, we cannot be assured that these weaknesses will be remediated or that other material weaknesses will not be discovered.

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
