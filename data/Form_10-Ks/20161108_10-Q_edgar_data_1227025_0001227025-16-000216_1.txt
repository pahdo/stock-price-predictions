Note 1. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies    

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements of NeoPhotonics Corporation ( NeoPhotonics  or the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in accordance with the instructions on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In accordance with those rules and regulations, the Company has omitted certain information and notes normally provided in the Company s annual consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, except as otherwise noted, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the entire fiscal year. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company operates in a dynamic industry and, accordingly, can be affected by a variety of factors.  For example, any of the following areas could have a negative effect on the Company in terms of its future financial position, results of operations or cash flows: the general state of the U.S., China and world economies; the highly cyclical nature of the industries the Company serves; the loss of any of a small number of its larger customers; ability to obtain additional financing; inability to meet certain debt covenants; fundamental changes in the technology underlying the Company s products; the hiring, training and retention of key employees; successful and timely completion of product design efforts; and new product design introductions by competitors. 

Reclassification  

Reclassification has been made to combine deferred income tax liabilities amount into other noncurrent liabilities in the prior year to conform to the current year s presentation.  

Concentration 

In the three months ended September 30, 2016, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and their affiliate HiSilicon Technologies (together with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.,  Huawei ) and Ciena Corporation ( Ciena ) accounted for approximately 48% and 15% of the Company s total revenue, respectively, and the Company s top ten customers represented approximately 91% of the Company s total revenue.  In the three months ended September 30, 2015, Huawei and Ciena accounted for approximately 41% and 26% of the Company s total revenue, respectively, and the Company s top ten customers represented approximately 92% of the Company s total revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Huawei and Ciena each accounted for approximately 49% and 15% of the Company s total revenue, respectively, and the top ten customers represented approximately 91% of its total revenue.  In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Huawei and Ciena accounted for approximately 40% and 24% of the Company s total revenue, respectively, and the Company s top ten customers represented approximately 91% of its total revenue. 

As of   September 30, 2016 and   December 31,   2015, one customer accounted for approximately 45% and 59%, respectively,   of the Company s total accounts receivable.

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made by management include: the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as future cash flows to be generated by those assets; fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations; allowances for doubtful accounts; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; valuation of excess and obsolete inventories; warranty reserves; litigation accrual and recognition of stock-based compensation, among others. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

There have been no significant changes in the Company s significant accounting policies in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Recent accounting pronouncements    

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ). Under ASU 2016-16, the transferring (selling) entity is required to recognize a current tax expense or benefit upon transfer of the asset. Similarly, the purchasing (receiving) entity is required to recognize a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability, as well as the related deferred tax benefit or expense, upon receipt of the asset. The resulting deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is measured by (1) computing the difference between the tax basis of the asset in the buyer s jurisdiction and its financial reporting carrying value in the consolidated financial statements and (2) multiplying such difference by the enacted tax rate in the buyer s jurisdiction. ASU 2016-16 is effective for the Company s interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis, recognizing the effects in retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted for the beginning of a fiscal year. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments     ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15   eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance   which will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.    ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company s annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented or prospectively from the earliest data practicable if retrospective application is impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 amends existing guidance on the impairment of financial assets and adds an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses for its financial assets. An entity will apply this guidance through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption (a modified-retrospective approach) while a prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company s annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company s annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. A retrospective transition method is required for the changes related to the recognition timing of excess tax benefits, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures and intrinsic value. A retrospective transition method is required for changes related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement. A prospective transition method is required for the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement for estimating expected term. Changes related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows can be applied using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In February 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that requires recognition of assets and liabilities arising from qualified leases on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations and to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition is required with certain optional practical expedients allowed. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ).  ASU 2016-01 revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  A modified retrospective transition method is required except for the equity securities without readily determinable fair values which will require a prospective transition method. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company s annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain provisions.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 requires entities to measure most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable value  but does not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. For the Company, this ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Prospective transition method is required and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued   ASU N  o. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ). The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for a one-year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and permits entities to early adopt the standard of ASU 2014-09 for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies are permitted to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ), which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB

issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606: Identifying performance obligations and Licensing   amending certain aspects of ASU 2014-09 on (1) identifying performance obligations and (2) licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   amending certain aspects of ASU 2016-09 including collectability, presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash transaction, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and the disclosure requirements for entities that use the full retrospective transition method.     The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses on its marketable securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any investments in marketable securities that were in an unrealized loss position for a period in excess of 12 months.  

Note 4.  Fair value disclosures  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  

The following table presents the Company's assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):    

*Fair values of the foreign currency forward contracts were immaterial as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company offers a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ( NQDC Plan ) to a select group of its highly compensated employees.  The NQDC Plan provides participants the opportunity to defer payment of certain compensation as defined in the NQDC Plan.  A Rabbi Trust has been established to fund the NQDC Plan obligation, which was fully funded at September 30, 2016.  The assets held by the Rabbi Trust are substantially in the form of exchange traded mutual funds and are included in the Company s other long-term assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Effective July 1, 2016, the Company has established a hedging program using forward exchange contracts as economic hedges, to protect against volatility of foreign exchange rate exposure when it is deemed economical to do so, based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. The forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting.  

Under the hedging program, the Company enters into monthly forward exchange contracts, that have average maturities of one month, to offset the effects of exchange rate exposures for its net intercompany activities denominated in Japanese Yen, or JPY, and Chinese Renminbi, or RMB, by buying and selling foreign currencies in the future at fixed   

12 

Table of Contents

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

(Unaudited)  

exchange rates, to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the balance sheet. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged assets, the increase in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the decrease in the expected future U.S. dollar cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar weakens, the decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the increase in the value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Accordingly, fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the re-measured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. The net effect of fair value changes is reported in     other (income) expense, net. As of September 30, 2016, the fair values of the Company s foreign currency forward contracts were immaterial due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which generally expire at each quarter-end. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts as of September 30, 2016 were approximately $39.2 million and $2.4 million for RMB and JPY, respectively. 

The following table presents the Company's liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2016. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company wrote off $0.2 million of property, plant and equipment and $0.2 million of held-for-sale assets. These assets were measured at fair value due to events or circumstances the Company identified as having significant impact on their fair value during the period. To arrive at the valuation of these assets, the Company considered the discounted cash flows to determine fair value using best estimates and unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 

The carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and short-term borrowings approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature and liquidity of these financial instruments. 

The fair values of the Company s long-term debt have been calculated using an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have had to pay on the issuance of liabilities with a similar maturity and discounting the cash flows at that rate which it considers to be a level 2 fair value measurement. The fair values, which approximate the carrying value of the long-term debt, do not necessarily give an indication of the amount that the Company would currently have to pay to extinguish any of this debt.  

Note 5. Business combination 

EMCORE Corporation 

On January 2, 2015, the Company closed an acquisition of the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE Corporation ( EMCORE ) for an original purchase price of $17.5 million, pursuant to   the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement between the parties dated October 22, 2014, under which the Company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of EMCORE s tunable laser product lines  . Consideration for the transaction consisted of $1.5 million in cash and a promissory note (the  EMCORE Note ) of approximately $16.0 million, which was subject to certain adjustments for inventory, net accounts receivable and pre-closing revenues, and was subsequently adjusted to $15.5 million in connection with a True-Up Confirmation Agreement (the  True-Up Agreement ) executed by and between the Company and EMCORE on April 16, 2015.        The True-Up Agreement made several final adjustments to the Asset Purchase

Agreement, including, among other things, (i) adjusting the principal amount of the EMCORE Note from approximately $16.0 million to approximately $15.5 million, (ii) agreeing upon final amounts for inventory value adjustment, net accounts receivable adjustment, and revenue purchase price adjustment, and (iii) resolving the treatment of certain accounts receivable for products sold by EMCORE prior to the closing of the transaction.    The adjusted purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $17.0 million. 

The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. With this acquisition, the Company strengthens its narrow line width tunable laser product portfolio. 

In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million in total acquisition-related costs related to legal, accounting and other professional services. The acquisition costs were expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

The Company s preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on estimated fair values as of the close of the acquisition. The fair values assigned to intangible assets acquired are based on valuations using estimates and assumptions provided by management, with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. These estimates were determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. While the Company used best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, estimates and assumptions were subject to refinement, including the acquired property, plant and equipment, prepaid and other current assets and accounts payable, as the Company was in the process of obtaining further information. As a result, during the preliminary measurement period, which was completed in 2015, the Company recorded adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Subsequent to the initial allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company adjusted the acquired net accounts receivable, the acquired net inventories, the assumed sales tax accrual and the acquired prepaid expenses and other current assets by immaterial amounts, and decreased goodwill by a corresponding net amount. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, goodwill was $1.1 million, which represented the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate net estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.

compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the amounts are settled.  

In July 2016, the Company s China subsidiary   renewed its short-term line of credit facility with a banking institution that expired in June 2016. Under the agreement, the Company could borrow up to RMB 120.0 million ($18.0 million) for short-term loans, which bear interest at varying rates, or up to approximately RMB 171.4 million ($25.8 million) for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement). This short-term line of credit facility was renewed in August 2016 and will expire in July 2019. In September 2015, the Company s China subsidiary renewed its second short-term line of credit facility with a banking institution, under which the Company can borrow up to RMB 133.0 million ($19.9 million) for short-term loan, which bore interest at varying rates, or up to approximately RMB 190.0 million ($28.5 million) for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement). This line of credit facility expired on September 30, 2016 and was renewed in October 2016. Under the renewed credit line, which will expire in September 2017, the Company can borrow up to RMB 266.0 million (approximately $39.9 million) for short-term loans at varying interest rates or up to approximately RMB 380.0 million (approximately $57.0 million) for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement).   

In August 2016, the Company s China subsidiary entered into a third line of credit facility with a banking institution that expires in July 2019. Under this line of credit, the Company can borrow up to RMB 30.0 million ($4.5 million) for short-term loans, which bear interest at varying rates, or up to approximately RMB 42.9 million ($6.4 million) for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement).  

Under these line of credit facilities, the non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts issued in connection with the Company s notes payable to its suppliers in China, had an outstanding balance of $7.7 million and $8.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition to the outstanding notes payable, two letters of credit totaling $1.3 million to its suppliers were issued in August 2016 and September 2016 for future equipment purchases that are expected to be delivered by December 2016. These letters of credit require a 30% compensating balance requirement.  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, compensating balances relating to these bank acceptance drafts and letters of credit issued to suppliers and the Company s subsidiaries totaled $2.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Compensating balances are classified as restricted cash on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

Short-term borrowing 

In April 2015, the Company repaid the interest and principal of its $5.0 million short-term advance financing agreement, dated October 2014, under one of its China subsidiary s line of credit facilities. This financing agreement bore interest at 4.02% per annum. 

In May 2015, the Company repaid the interest and principal of its second   $5.0 million short-term advance financing agreement, dated November 2014, under one of its China subsidiary s line of credit facilities. This financing agreement bore interest at 2.33%   per annum and service fees at 1.00% per annum. 

In September 2015, the Company repaid the interest and principal of its $5.0 million advance financing agreement, dated April 2015, under one of its China subsidiary s line of credit facilities.   This financing agreement bore interest   at a six-month LIBOR plus 330 basis points, or approximately 3.71% per annum.

Acquisition-related  

In connection with the purchase consideration to acquire the tunable laser products of EMCORE in January 2015 (See Note 5), the Company issued the EMCORE Note, as amended, of $15.5 million, which had a maturity of two years from the closing of the transaction and an interest rate of 5% per annum for the first year and 13% per annum for the second year. The interest was payable semi-annually in cash. The EMCORE Note was   subordinated   to the Company s existing bank debt in the U.S. and was repaid in full     in April 2015. 

Bank borrowings  

The Company has a credit agreement with Comerica Bank as lead bank in the U.S.   (the  Comerica Bank Credit Facility ).   The   Comerica Bank Credit Facility requires the maintenance of a modified EBITDA and certain liquidity covenants.   The credit agreement also restricts the Company s ability to incur certain additional debt or to engage in specified transactions, restricts the payment of dividends and is secured by substantially all of the Company s U.S. assets, other than intellectual property assets.  

The Company amended the Comerica Bank Credit Facility in January 2015 to modify the EBITDA and liquidity covenants and eliminate the need to maintain compensating balances (restricted cash). In March 2015, the Company further amended the Comerica Bank Credit Facility to increase borrowing capacity to $30.0 million.   

In September 2016, the Company amended the Comerica Bank Credit Facility   to increase the limitation on the Company s capital expenditures to $62.0 million for fiscal year 2016 and to provide for an extension of the maturity date to January 31, 2017.   As of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility. 

Borrowings under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility bear interest at an interest rate option of a base rate as defined in the agreement plus 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75%. Base rate is based on the greater of (a) the effective prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds effective rate plus one percent, and (c) the daily adjusting LIBOR rate plus one percent.   Amounts borrowed, if any, are due on or before January 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, the rate on the LIBOR option was 3.28%. As of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was $23.8     million outstanding.    On February 25, 2015, the Company entered into certain loan agreements and related special agreements with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the  Mitsubishi Bank ) that provided for (i) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of   500 million JPY ($4.2 million) (the  Term Loan A ) and (ii) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of one billion JPY ($8.4 million)   (the  Term Loan B  and together with the Term Loan A, the  Mitsubishi Bank Loans ). The Mitsubishi Bank Loans are secured by a mortgage on certain real property and buildings owned by our Japanese subsidiary. The full amount of each of the Mitsubishi Bank Loans was drawn on the closing date of February 25, 2015. Interest on the Mitsubishi Bank Loans accrues and is paid monthly based upon the annual rate of the monthly Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate (TIBOR) plus 1.40%. The Term Loan A requires interest only payments until the maturity date of February 23, 2018, with a lump sum payment of the aggregate principal amount on the maturity date. The Term Loan B requires equal monthly payments of principal equal to 8,333,000 JPY until the maturity date of February 25, 2025, with a lump sum payment of the balance of 8,373,000 JPY on the maturity date. Interest on the Term Loan B is accrued based upon monthly TIBOR plus 1.40% and is secured by real estate collateral. In conjunction with the execution of the Bank Loans, the Company paid a loan structuring fee, including consumption tax, of 40,500,000 JPY ($0.3   million)  . 

The Mitsubishi Bank Loans contain customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company s Japanese subsidiary, including, among other things, restrictions on cessation in business, management, mergers or acquisitions. The Mitsubishi Bank Loans contain financial covenants relating to minimum net assets, maximum ordinary loss and a dividends covenant. The Mitsubishi Bank Loans also include customary events of default, including but not limited to the nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of

covenants, restraint on business, dissolution, bankruptcy, attachment and misrepresentations. In February 2015, the Company used a portion of the proceeds of the Mitsubishi Bank Loans to repay the then-outstanding loan related to the acquisition of NeoPhotonics Semiconductor, which had an outstanding principal and interest amount of approximately 710 million JPY ($6.0   million)   and the remaining proceeds will be used for general working capital. Outstanding principal balance under the Mitsubishi Bank Loans   was approximately 1.3 billion JPY (approximately $13.3 million), net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 23.7 million JPY (approximately $0.2 million), as of September 30, 2016 and 1.4 billion JPY (approximately $11.5 million), net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 30.1 million JPY (approximately $0.3 million) as of December 31, 2015. The Company was in compliance with the related covenants. 

At September 30, 2016, maturities of long-term debt were as follows (in thousands):  

Note 9. Japan pension plans  

In connection with its acquisition of NeoPhotonics Semiconductor on March 29, 2013 from LAPIS Semiconductor Co., Ltd. ( LAPIS ), the Company assumed responsibility for two defined benefit plans that provide retirement benefits to its NeoPhotonics Semiconductor employees in Japan: the Retirement Allowance Plan ( RAP ) and the Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan ( DBCPP ). The RAP is an unfunded plan administered by the Company.  Effective February 28, 2014, the DBCPP was converted to a defined contribution plan ( DCP ).  In May 2014, in accordance with the acquisition agreements, the seller transferred approximately $2.0 million into the newly formed DCP which is the allowable amount that can be transferred according to   the Japanese regulations. LAPIS also paid the Company approximately $0.3 million in connection with the conversion of the plan.   Additionally,   the Company transferred the net unfunded projected benefit obligation amount from the DBCPP to the RAP and froze the RAP benefit at the February 28, 2014 amount.  

The pension liability at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 was $5.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, of which $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities and the remainder in other noncurrent liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet.  

As the Company transitioned the DBCPP to the DCP effective February 2014, no further contributions to the DBCPP are required. 

Net periodic pension cost associated with these plans was immaterial in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Note 10. Commitments and contingencies 

Litigation  

From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for legal contingencies if the Company can estimate the potential liability and if the Company believes it is probable that the case will be ruled against it. If a legal claim for which the Company did not accrue is resolved against it, the Company would record the expense in the period in which the ruling was made. The Company believes that the likelihood of an ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (alone or combined) that will materially affect the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows is remote. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, however, and unfavorable outcomes could have a material negative impact on the Company s financial condition and operating results. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors.  

On January 5, 2010, Finisar Corporation, or Finisar, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, or the Court, against Source Photonics, Inc., MRV Communications, Inc., Oplink Communications, Inc. and the Company, or collectively, the co-defendants. In the complaint Finisar alleged infringement of certain of its U.S. patents. In 2010 the Company filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims, asserting two claims of patent infringement and additional claims. The Court dismissed without prejudice all co-defendants (including the Company) except Source Photonics, Inc., on grounds that such claims should have been asserted in four separate lawsuits, one against each defendant. This dismissal does not prevent Finisar from bringing a new similar lawsuit against the Company. In 2011 the Company and Finisar agreed to suspend their respective claims and in 2012 the Company and Finisar further agreed to toll their respective claims. While there has been no action on this matter since 2012, the Company is currently unable to predict the outcome of this dispute and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss.  

On January 2, 2013, the Company was served with a lawsuit, filed in Belgium by a distributor called Laser 2000 Beneluo SA ( Laser 2000 ) claiming unpaid commissions. The distributor agreement was formally terminated as of January 3, 2012. The Company paid $492,000 to Laser 2000 as partial settlement of claims and to avoid penalties from the Belgian Court and submitted a legal brief to court on September 16, 2013. Laser 2000 filed a response on December 16, 2013 and the Company filed the final rebuttal brief on January 30, 2014. On March 23, 2015, the Belgian Court issued a ruling awarding Laser 2000 approximately one million euros in damages (approximately $1,100,000 at current exchange rates). The Company was served with the judgment on September 28, 2015. The Company is appealing this verdict, but is unable to predict the duration or outcome of the appeal or the overall lawsuit at this time. The Company does not believe it will ultimately be liable for the full amount of damage; however, in light of developments in the case, the Company increased its accrual for estimated probable net litigation expense relating to this matter in March 2015. There has been no change in such accrual subsequent to March 2015. 

Indemnifications  

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnification. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. However, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

Leases 

The Company leases various facilities under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2027. As of September 30, 2016, future minimum payments under these operating leases totaled approximately $27.8 million and future minimum sublease receipts was approximately $1.1 million. Rent expense was $0.6 million and $1.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.5 million and $1.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company renewed one of its leases for its facility in Fremont, California.   In September 2016, the Company entered into an office lease for approximately 64,000 square feet of office and laboratory space located adjacent to the Company s current headquarters in San Jose (the  Lease ). 

The term of the Lease is scheduled to commence on January 1, 2017. Upon commencement, the Lease has an initial term of one hundred and twenty-nine (129) months, ending on September 30, 2027 (the  Initial Term ), with a monthly rental rate of $144,000, escalating annually to a maximum monthly rental rate of approximately $194,000 in the last year of the Initial Term. The Landlord has agreed to provide the office and laboratory space to the Company free of charge for the first nine months of the Initial Term through September 30, 2017. Upon termination of the Lease, the Company anticipates a restoration cost of approximately $2.8 million. 

Penalty Payment Derivative 

In connection with a private placement transaction with Joint Stock Company  Rusnano  (formerly   Open Joint Stock Company  RUSNANO  ), or Rusnano, or   in 2012, the Company agreed to certain performance obligations including establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia and making a $30.0 million investment commitment (the  Investment Commitment ) towards the Company s Russian operations, which could be partially satisfied by cash and/or non-cash investment inside or outside of Russia and/or by way of non-cash asset transfers.  

In March 2015, the Company extended the Investment Commitment deadline to June 30, 2015 and then further amended the Investment Commitment in July 2015. The latter amendment, or the Rights Agreement, became effective on June 30, 2015 and provides that the maximum amount of penalties, or the Penalty Payment, to be paid by the Company will not exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, the amendment also provides for an updated investment plan for the Company s Russian subsidiaries that includes non-cash transfer of licensing rights to intellectual property, non-cash transfers of existing equipment and commitments to complete the remaining investment milestones through fiscal year 2019. The Company fulfilled its investment commitment required by 2015 and had contributed over $15.4 million in cash and assets to its subsidiaries in Russia as of December 31, 2015.  Although the Company met its investment commitment for 2015, certain required equipment was delivered but not fully installed and operational as of the required date to fulfill certain manufacturing milestones under the Rights Agreement. The Company has remediated these issues and, in August 2016, entered into the second amendment to the Rights Agreement with Rusnano (the  Amended Rights Agreement ) to address this matter. The amendment extended the foregoing manufacturing deadlines to June 30, 2016 and confirmed that the Company had completed these milestones as of June 30, 2016. Therefore, the Company will not be held liable for the $5.0 million Penalty Payment as of each of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  

In the event the Company s cumulative investment and spending contributed to its subsidiaries in Russia is less than $18.8 million by December 31, 2016, the Company will be subject to a $1.5 million penalty within 30 days after the end of a 90-day cure period. If certain of the Investment Commitments are not achieved in the indicated time frames in 2016 and 2019, the Company also has the ability to cease the operations of its Russian subsidiaries by paying exit fees of $3.5 million or $2.0 million at the end of 2016 or 2019, respectively.   

In August 2016, the Company entered into a letter of agreement with Rusnano to agree to transfer a product line and incur expected costs of approximately $0.1 million by July 30, 2017. 

Rusnano has non-transferable veto rights over the Company s Russian subsidiaries  annual budget during the investment period and must approve non-cash asset transfers to be made in satisfaction of the Investment Commitment.

Spending and/or commitments to spend for general working capital and research and development do not require approval by Rusnano. There are no legal restrictions on the specific usage of the $39.8 million received in the private placement transaction or on withdrawal from the Company s bank accounts for use in general corporate purposes.  

The Company accounted for the Penalty Payment as an embedded derivative instrument, with the underlying being the performance or nonperformance of meeting the Investment Commitment   and initially classified $4.9 million of the $5.0 million as additional paid-in capital and the remaining $0.1 million, representing the estimated fair value of the Penalty Payment derivative, in other noncurrent liabilities.  

The fair value of the Penalty Payment derivative has been estimated at the date of the original common stock sale (April 27, 2012) and at each subsequent balance sheet date using a probability-weighted discounted future cash flow approach using unobservable inputs, which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The primary inputs for this approach include the probability of achieving the Investment Commitment and a discount rate that approximates the Company s incremental borrowing rate. After the initial measurement, changes in the fair value of this derivative were recorded in other expense, net. The estimated fair value of this derivative, after taking into consideration the non-compliance regarding the manufacturing milestone and the Amended Rights Agreement, was $0.4 million as of each of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and reported within accrued and other current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 4). 

Separately, in December 2014, the Company entered into a Commitment to File a Registration Statement and Related Waiver of Registration Rights, whereby Rusnano waived certain registration rights in connection with a potential offering by the Company of shares of the Company s common stock, and the Company committed to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a resale registration statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of all shares of the Company s common stock held by Rusnano, or the 2015 Registration Statement. The Company filed the 2015 Registration Statement in April 2015 (See Note 11).  Rusnano also waived its demand registration rights under the original rights agreement and agreed to enter into a lock up agreement with the Company whereby it would agree not to sell any shares of the Company s common stock, or engage in certain other transactions relating to the Company s securities, for a period of 60 days from the filing date of the 2015 Registration Statement. Rusnano signed such lock up agreement with the Company on April 2, 2015. In addition, in connection with the Company s public stock offering completed in the second quarter of 2015, or the 2015 Follow-On Offering, Rusnano entered into a separate lock up agreement with Needham   Company, LLC, the lead underwriter of the 2015 Follow-On Offering, whereby it agreed not to sell any shares of the Company s common stock, or engage in certain other transactions relating to the Company s securities, for a period of 180 days from May 21, 2015. Such lock up agreement expired in November 2015.

Follow-On Public Offering 

In the second quarter of 2015, the Company completed the 2015 Follow-On Offering, in which the Company sold 6,866,689 shares of its common stock, including 895,655 shares of common stock sold upon the exercise in full of the overallotment option by the underwriters, at a public offering price of $7.25 per share. The Company raised approximately $45.6 million, net of underwriting discounts of $3.0 million and other offering expenses of approximately $1.2 million. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 

The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related taxes, were as follows (in thousands): 

No material amounts were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income during the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015 for realized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities. 

Accumulated Deficit 

Approximately $7.9 million of the Company s retained earnings within its total accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 was subject to restriction due to the fact that the Company s subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year end to fund statutory common reserves as well as allocate a discretional portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus fund.

Note 12. Stock-based compensation 

The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Stock-based compensation expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included approximately $5.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, net of approximately $0.8 million capitalized in inventory, associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options covering approximately 1.1 million shares of the Company s common stock and stock appreciation units ( SAUs ) of approximately 0.2 million shares with a market-based vesting condition. In September 2016, the market-based condition of these stock options and SAUs was satisfied when the average closing price of the Company s common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days equal to or exceeded $15.00 per share and the recipients remained in the continuous service with the Company.  

Determining Fair Value  

The Company estimated the fair value of certain stock-based awards using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model or a binomial lattice model with the following assumptions:

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) 

The following table summarizes the Company s stock option and RSU activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Stock appreciation units  

SAUs are liability classified share-based awards. The Company did not grant any SAUs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 293,457 and 342,316 SAUs outstanding. Outstanding SAUs are re-measured each reporting period at fair value until settlement.  

Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP )  

As of September 30, 2016, there was $0.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for employee stock purchase rights that will be recognized over the remaining offering period through November 2016.  

Note 13. Income taxes  

The provision for income taxes in the periods presented is based upon the income (loss) before income taxes:  

The Company s income tax provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to income taxes of the Company s non-U.S. operations.  

The Company conducts its business globally and its operating income is subject to varying rates of tax in the U.S., China and Japan. Consequently, the Company s effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of its earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. Historically, the Company has experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, expects this trend to continue. One of the Company s subsidiaries in China historically qualified for a preferential 15% tax rate available for high technology enterprises as opposed to the statutory 25% tax rate. In June 2016, the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice to adjust the requirements for high technology enterprise status. As a result, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company s China subsidiary will not meet the requirements for the tax year 2016 as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, the Company has computed its China subsidiary s tax provision for 2016 based on a 25% regular corporate income tax rate and remeasured its deferred tax assets accordingly. The preferential tax rate is subject to renewal for periods after 2016.

Due to historic losses in the U.S., the Company has a full valuation allowance on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Management continues to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. If management's assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, the Company would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which management makes the determination. 

As of September 30, 2016, there were no material changes to either the nature or the amounts of the uncertain tax positions previously determined for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Note 14. Subsequent events 

Subsequent events, through the filing of this report, included the following: 

Repayment of Comerica Credit Facility 

In October 2016, the Company repaid the outstanding balance under its Comerica Bank Credit Facility, which was $23.8 million as of September 30, 2016. 

Shelf Registration 

In October 2016, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through which it may offer to sell $80.0 million of its common stock from time-to-time. In addition, the registration statement registered 8,261,882 shares of the Company s common stock held by certain stockholders. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sales of the Company s common stock held by its selling stockholders.

Business overview  

We develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks. We sell our products to the world s leading network equipment manufacturers, including Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., HiSilicon Technologies, Ltd., an affiliate of Huawei Technologies, Co., Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (collectively  Huawei ) and Nokia Corporation (formerly Alcatel-Lucent SA which was acquired by Nokia Corporation in January 2016). These companies are among our largest customers and a focus of our strategy due to their leading market positions.  

We have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China, Ottawa, Canada, and Moscow, Russia. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing. We believe we are one of the highest volume Photonic Integrated Circuit, or PIC, manufacturers in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs. 

Recognizing our focus on growth in our 100Gbps ( 100G ) and beyond products, we aligned our product group reporting to  High Speed Products  which includes products designed for 100G and beyond applications and  Network Products and Solutions  which comprises all products designed for applications below 100G and includes 40G products previously included in our  High Speed Products  group. Our High Speed Products primarily implement coherent technology and include those designed for 100G and beyond data rates for telecom and datacenter or content provider networks and applications.

Table of Contents     

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, High Speed Products represented approximately 67% and 66%, respectively, of total revenue and Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 33% and 34%, respectively, of total revenue.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, High Speed Products was 56% and 58%, respectively, of total revenue and Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 44% and 42%, respectively, of total revenue.  

Revenue grew 24% and 20%, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 2% and 10%, respectively, in the same periods in 2015. The revenue growth was driven primarily by demand for our High Speed Products, as carriers continued to accelerate deployment of high capacity optical transport networks particularly in China. Our gross profit was 26.6% and 28.5% of revenue, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 28.4% and 29.6% of revenue, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily attributable to pricing and a bankruptcy filing by one of our distributors, partially offset by cost savings, yields and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix.  

We are planning to reduce volume and end the production for certain low speed passive optical network, or PON, products that accounted for approximately $6.5 million and $25.9 million of total revenue, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and are expected to represent approximately $30 million of total revenue in 2016. These products are focused on passive optical network applications and are nearing their end-of-life with relatively low gross margins. The end-of-life process is expected to span approximately three fiscal quarters to complete and is part of our product evolution cycle to reduce legacy products that may no longer meet our requirements for gross margin and profitability.  

We expect continued volume growth for our High Speed Products, although quarter-to-quarter results may show considerable variability as is usual in a rapid initial ramp-up for a new technology.  Similar to revenue, our gross margins may fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors including average selling price changes, product mix, volume, manufacturing utilization and ongoing manufacturing process improvements. 

In October 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through which we may offer to sell $80.0 million of our common stock from time-to-time. In addition, the registration statement registered 8,261,882 shares of our outstanding common stock held by certain stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the sales of our common stock held by our selling stockholders. 

Critical accounting policies and estimates  

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from those disclosed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Results of operations  

Revenue  

We sell substantially all of our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer. We price our products based on market and competitive conditions and may periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced. Historically, our first quarter revenue is generally seasonally lower than the rest of the year primarily due to lower capacity utilization during the holidays in China and customer pricing schedules. However, this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. In 2016, this historical pattern shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter due to certain price reductions being delayed beyond the first quarter in part due to surging volumes in the first quarter supporting 100G build-outs, notably in China. Our sales transactions to customers are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, with some portions in Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ) or Japanese Yen ( JPY ).  

We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Customers accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue and revenue from our top ten customers in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

(1) 

Huawei s percentage of revenue included its affiliate, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd. ( HiSilicon ). Revenue from HiSilicon represented approximately 34% and 18% of total revenue, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and approximately 33% and 19% of total revenue, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     

We expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers. As a result, the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from any of our key customers would materially affect our revenue and results of operations. Similarly, our accounts receivable are from a limited number of customers. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, one customer accounted for 45% and 59%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenue increased $19.8 million, or 24%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in revenue from our High Speed Products driven by strong demand for 100G products.  The increase from High Speed Products revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our Network Products and Solutions group primarily due to a decline in revenue from low speed PON products and a $2.2 million revenue that cannot be recognized as a result of a distributor s bankruptcy reorganization. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, High Speed Products represented approximately 67% of total revenue, compared to 56% of total revenue in the same period in 2015 while Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 33% of total revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 44% of total revenue in the same period in 2015. Revenue from China, Americas, Japan and rest of the world was 61%, 19%, 1% and 19% of total

Table of Contents     

revenue, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 50%, 28%, 4% and 18% of total revenue, respectively, in the same period in 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenue increased $51.3 million, or 20%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in revenue from our High Speed Products driven by strong demand for 100G products, notably in China.  The increase from High Speed Products revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our Network Products and Solutions group partly attributable to a decline in revenue from low speed PON products and a $2.2 million revenue that cannot be recognized as a result of a distributor s bankruptcy reorganization. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, High Speed Products represented approximately 66% of total revenue, compared to 58% of total revenue in the same period in 2015 while Network Products and Solutions represented approximately 34% of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 42% of total revenue in the same period in 2015. Revenue from China, Americas, Japan and rest of the world was 61%, 14%, 4% and 21% of total revenue, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 49%, 29%, 4% and 18% of total revenue, respectively, in the same period in 2015.  

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit  

Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost to produce wafers and to manufacture and test our products. Additionally, our cost of goods sold generally includes stock-based compensation, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, depreciation, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, restructuring charges, warranty costs, royalty payments, logistics and allocated facilities costs.   

Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and is expected to continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the introduction of new products, production volume, production volume compared to sales over time, the mix of products sold, inventory changes, changes in the average selling prices of our products, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor costs, changes in overhead costs or requirements, stock-based compensation, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs. In addition, we periodically negotiate pricing with certain customers which can cause our gross margins to fluctuate, particularly in the quarters in which the negotiations occurred. Historically, our first quarter gross margins are generally seasonally lower than the fourth quarter of the prior year due to customer pricing schedules as well as lower capacity utilization during the holidays in China and the lower installment of outside plant equipment by customers in winter.  In 2016, this historical pattern shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter due to certain price reductions being delayed beyond the first quarter in part due to surging volumes in the first quarter supporting 100G build-outs, notably in China.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Gross profit increased $3.7 million, or 15%, to $27.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $23.8 million in the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume and continuous costs reduction efforts. Gross margin decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to pricing and a $1.4 million unfavorable cost of goods sold impact   

32 

Table of Contents     

as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors, partially offset by cost savings, yields and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix.   

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Gross profit increased $12.1 million, or 16%, to $86.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $74.0 million in the same period in 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume as well as an increase in sales toward our High Speed Products, driven by the strong 100G product demand and the associated strong manufacturing utilization. Gross margin decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to pricing and a $1.4 million unfavorable cost of goods sold impact as a result of the unrecoverable inventory associated with the bankruptcy reorganization by one of our distributors, partially offset by cost savings, yield and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix. 

Operating expenses  

Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of costs such as salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and, with regard to sales and marketing expense, other variable compensation. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $5.8 million was recorded in our operating expenses attributable to the accelerated vesting of our stock options and stock appreciation units ( SAUs ) with a market-based vesting condition as such condition was satisfied when the average closing price of our common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days exceeded $15.0 per share in September 2016. Stock-based compensation related to outstanding SAUs are subject to remeasurement until settlement dates. Our operating expenses are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, or USD, Chinese Renminbi, or RMB and Japanese Yen, or JPY.  

Research and development  

Research and development expense consists of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our research and development personnel, and product development costs, including engineering services, development software and hardware tools, depreciation of equipment and facility costs. We record all research and development expense as incurred.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Research and development expense increased by $6.7 million, or 62%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $2.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense largely driven by higher market price of the Company s common stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, a $2.4 million increase in development projects including prototype and materials, a $0.8 million net increase in payroll and related expenses and a $0.7 million increase in outside development services in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same 2015 period. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

33 

Table of Contents     

Research and development expense increased by $9.5 million, or 29%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense largely due to the higher market price of our common stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, a $2.6 million increase in development spending including prototype and materials, a $2.0 million increase in payroll and related costs, a $1.0 million increase in outsider services, a $0.4 million reduction in administrative reimbursements and a $0.3 million increase in net allocated costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same 2015 period. 

Sales and marketing  

Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and other variable compensation, costs related to sales and marketing programs and services and facility costs.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Sales and marketing expense increased by $2.1 million, or 57%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense largely due to the higher market price of our common stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards and a $0.3 million increase in payroll and related costs, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in the doubtful account provision.  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Sales and marketing expense increased by $2.2 million, or 20%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense largely due to the higher market price of our common stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, a $0.5 million increase in payroll and related costs and a $0.3 million increase in variable compensation, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in the doubtful account provision due to collections. 

General and administrative     

General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, for our finance,  human resources and information technology personnel and certain executive officers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services, depreciation and facility costs.  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

General and administrative expense increased by $2.4 million, or 33%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to a $2.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense largely due to the higher market price of our common stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, a $0.2 million increase in payroll and related costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction in variable compensation and $0.2 million decrease in accrued sales and export taxes.  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

General and administrative expense increased by $3.7 million, or 16%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to a $3.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense largely due to the higher market price of our common stock and the accelerated vesting of our market-based stock awards, a $0.7 million increase in payroll and related costs, a $0.6 million increase in accrued sales and export taxes and a $0.2 million increase in employee related expenses, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in facility charges, a $0.5 milion increase in governmental incentives and a $0.4 million decrease in variable compensation expense.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets  

Our intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.  Amortization expense relating to technology, patents and leasehold interests are included within cost of goods sold, while customer relationships and other agreements are recorded within operating expenses. Amortization of purchased intangibles included in operating expenses was relatively consistent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and included the amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of EMCORE s tunable laser products in January 2015.  

Acquisition-related transaction costs 

We incurred $0.1 million and $0.9 million in acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other professional services in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Acquisition related costs were $0.2 million and $0.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, related to legal, accounting and other professional services for our acquisition activities, including our acquisition of tunable laser products from EMCORE.  

Restructuring charges  

There were no restructuring charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Restructuring charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were immaterial and were related to our restructuring plan initiated in 2014 (the  2014 Restructuring Plan ) to refocus on our strategy execution, optimize our structure, and improve operational efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan consisted of workforce reductions primarily in the U.S and in China and was completed in October 2015.  

Interest and other income (expense), net  

Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as restricted cash and investments. Interest expense consists of amounts paid for interest on our bank and other borrowings. Other expense, net is primarily made up of government subsidies as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in China is the RMB and of our subsidiary in Japan is the JPY.  The foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our subsidiaries in China and Japan primarily result from their transactions in U.S. dollars.  

Total interest and other income (expense), net decreased by $1.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.8 million unfavorable change in other income (expense), net primarily attributable to a foreign exchange related loss as a result of stronger RMB against the U.S. dollar in the 2016 period. 

Total interest and other income (expense), net decreased by $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to a $3.2 million unfavorable change in other income (expense), net primarily driven by a foreign exchange related loss as a result of stronger JPY and RMB against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in interest expense primarily attributable to less borrowing activities in the U.S. and China in the 2016 period.

Income taxes  

We conduct our business globally and our operating income is subject to varying rates of tax in the U.S., China, Japan and other various foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. Historically, we have experienced net losses in the U.S. and in the short term, we expect this trend to continue. In China, one of our subsidiaries has historically qualified for a preferential 15% tax rate available for high technology enterprises as opposed to the statutory 25% tax rate. In June 2016, the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice to adjust the requirements for high technology enterprise status. As a result, we believe that it is more likely than not that our China subsidiary will not meet the requirements for the tax year 2016 as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, we have computed our China subsidiary s tax provision for 2016 based on a 25% regular corporate income tax rate and remeasured our deferred tax assets accordingly. The preferential tax rate is subject to renewal for periods after 2016. 

Our income tax provision in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to income taxes of our non-U.S. operations.  

Liquidity and capital resources  

At September 30, 2016, we had working capital of $136.8 million and total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $100.1 million. Approximately 37% of our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was held by our foreign entities, including approximately $24.8 million held in accounts by our subsidiaries in China and approximately $12.3 million held in accounts by our subsidiary in Japan. In addition, we had $2.8 million in restricted cash in accounts held by our subsidiaries in China as of September 30, 2016. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash held outside of the U.S. may be subject to taxes if repatriated and may not be immediately available for our working capital needs. 

Approximately $7.9 million of our retained earnings within our total accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 was subject to restrictions due to the fact that our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year end to fund statutory common reserves as well as allocate a discretionary portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus fund.  This restricted amount is not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. 

In the U.S., we have a bank credit agreement with Comerica Bank. Our credit agreement, as amended, with Comerica Bank, or the Comerica Bank Credit Facility, restricts our ability to incur certain additional debt or to engage in specified transactions, restricts the payment of dividends and is secured by substantially all of its U.S. assets, other than intellectual property assets, and requires us to maintain certain   financial covenants, including the maintenance of a modified EBITDA and certain liquidity covenants. As of   September 30, 2016, our borrowing capacity under our Comerica Bank Credit Facility was $30.0 million, subject to covenant requirements. Amounts borrowed under the Comerica Bank Credit Facility are due on or before January 31, 2017 and borrowings bear interest at an interest rate option of a base rate as defined in the agreement plus 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75%. As of September 30, 2016, the rate on the LIBOR option was 3.28% and the outstanding balance was $23.8 million, which was repaid in October 2016.  

We regularly issue notes payable to our suppliers in China in exchange for accounts payable. These notes are supported by non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts and are due three to six months after issuance. As a condition of the notes payable arrangements, we are required to keep a compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the amounts are settled.  

Our subsidiary in China has three short-term line of credit facilities with two banking institutions. Under the short-term line of credit facility agreement renewed in June 2015, up to RMB 120.0 million ($18.0 million) could be used for   

36 

Table of Contents     

short-term loans, which bore interest at varying rates, or up to approximately RMB 171.4 million ($25.8 million) could be used for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement). This line of credit facility expired in June 2016 and was renewed in August 2016 and will expire in July 2019. Under our China subsidiary s second short-term line of credit facility, up to RMB 133.0 million ($19.9 million) can be used for short-term loan or up to approximately RMB 190.0 million ($28.5 million) can be used for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement). This line of credit facility expired in September 2016 and, in October 2016, was renewed to extend the expiration date to September 2017 and to increase the credit limit to RMB 266.0 million (approximately $39.9 million) for short-term loans at varying interest rates or up to RMB 380.0 million (approximately $57.0 million) with a 30% compensating balance. In August 2016, our China subsidiary entered into a third line of credit facility with a banking institution that expires in July 2019. Under this line of credit, we can borrow up to RMB 30.0 million ($4.5 million) for short-term loans, which bear interest at varying rates, or up to approximately RMB 42.9 million ($6.4 million) for bank acceptance drafts (with a 30% compensating balance requirement).  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the non-interest bearing bank acceptance drafts issued in connection with our notes payable to our suppliers in China under these line of credit facilities had an outstanding balance of $7.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The compensating balance for these bank acceptance drafts totaled $2.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and was classified as restricted cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

On February 25, 2015,   our subsidiary in Japan   entered into certain loan agreements   and related special agreements with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (the  Mitsubishi Bank ) that provided for (i) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million JPY ($4.2 million) (the  Term Loan A ) and (ii) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of one billion JPY ($8.4 million) (the  Term Loan B  and together with the Term Loan A, the  Mitsubishi Bank Loans ). The Mitsubishi Bank Loans are secured by a mortgage on certain real property and buildings owned by our Japanese subsidiary in Japan. The full amount of each of the Mitsubishi Bank Loans was drawn on the closing date of February 25, 2015. Interest on the Mitsubishi Bank Loans accrues and is paid monthly based upon the annual rate of the monthly Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate (TIBOR) plus 1.40%. The Term Loan A requires interest only payments until the maturity date of February 23, 2018, with a lump sum payment of the aggregate principal amount on the maturity date. The Term Loan B requires equal monthly payments of principal equal to 8,333,000 JPY until the maturity date of February 25, 2025, with a lump sum payment of the balance of 8,373,000 JPY on the maturity date. Interest on the Term Loan B is accrued based upon monthly TIBOR plus 1.40% and is secured by real estate collateral. In conjunction with the execution of the Mitsubishi Bank Loans, we paid a loan structuring fee, including consumption tax, of 40,500,000 JPY ($0.3 million). 

The Mitsubishi Bank Loans contain customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, restrictions on cessation in business, management, mergers or acquisitions. The Mitsubishi Bank Loans also contain financial covenants relating to minimum net assets, maximum ordinary loss and a dividends covenant. The Mitsubishi Bank Loans also include customary events of default, including but not limited to the nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, restraint on business, dissolution, bankruptcy, attachment and misrepresentations. In February 2015, we used a portion of the proceeds of the Mitsubishi Bank Loans to repay the then-outstanding   outstanding principal and interest amount of approximately 710 million JPY ($6.0 million) under the   loan from the acquisition of   NeoPhotonics Semiconductor.   

Our total outstanding balance under the Mitsubishi Bank Loans was 1.3 billion JPY (approximately $13.3 million), net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 23.7 million JPY (approximately $0.2 million), as of September 30, 2016 and $1.4 billion JPY (approximately $11.5 million), net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 30.1 million JPY (approximately $0.3 million), as of December 31, 2015. 

On January 2, 2015, we closed an acquisition of the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE for approximately $17.5 million. Consideration for the transaction consisted of $1.5 million in cash and a promissory note of approximately $16.0 million, which was subject to certain adjustments for inventory, net accounts receivable and pre-closing revenues and was subsequently adjusted to $15.5 million and was fully repaid in April 2015.

From time to time we accept notes receivable in exchange for accounts receivable from certain of our customers in China. These notes receivable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within six months.  Historically, we have collected on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity.  

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months.  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the costs to increase our manufacturing capacity and our foreign operations, the continuing market acceptance of our products and acquisitions of businesses and technology. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.  

Private placement transaction  

In April 2012, we entered into a rights agreement with Rusnano, one of our principal stockholders. Under the rights agreement, we agreed to make a $30.0 million investment commitment, or the Investment Commitment, toward our Russian operations. The Investment Commitment can be partially satisfied by cash and/or non-cash investment inside or outside of Russia and/or by way of non-cash asset transfers. 

In July 2015,   we amended our rights agreement with Rusnano. The amendment to the rights agreement became effective on June 30, 2015 and provides for an updated investment plan for our Russian subsidiaries that includes a non-cash transfer of licensing rights to intellectual property, non-cash transfers of exiting equipment and commitments to complete the remaining milestones of approximately one-half of the overall investment through fiscal year 2019. It also provides that the maximum amount of penalties to be paid by us will not exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate, with the following penalties for failure to meet specified milestones and exit options at the end of the following years, subject to a 90-day cure period ( Cure Period ) following such years: 

By December 31, 2015, if the actual cumulative investment and spending to our Russian subsidiaries was less than $13.0 million, or if we had not sold any products manufactured by its Russian subsidiary, or if we had not completed agreed-upon manufacturing milestones, then we would be subject to a $5.0 million penalty within 30 days after the end of the applicable Cure Period; if the cumulative investments and spending to our Russian subsidiaries were less than $15.4 million but more than $13.0 million by December 31, 2015 and was not cured within the applicable Cure Period, we would be subject to a $1.5 million penalty within 30 days after the end of the applicable Cure Period. We fulfilled our investment commitment required by 2015 and had contributed over $15.4 million in cash and assets to our subsidiaries in Russia as of December 31, 2015. We also satisfied the requirement related to sale of products manufactured by our Russian subsidiary as of December 31, 2015. However, we were not in full compliance with the completion of agreed-upon manufacturing milestones as of December 31, 2015 (and as of the end of the Cure Period ended March 30, 2016) since certain required equipment was delivered but not fully installed and operational as of that date. We have remediated these issues and, in August 2016, entered into the second amendment to the Rights Agreement with Rusnano (the  Amended Rights Agreement ) to address this matter. The amendment extended the foregoing manufacturing deadlines to June 30, 2016 and confirmed that we had completed these milestones as of June 30, 2016. As a result, we will not be held liable for the $5.0 million penalty.     

By December 31, 2016, if the actual cumulative investment and spending to our subsidiaries in Russia is less than $18.8 million, we will be subject to a $1.5 million penalty within 30 days after the end of the applicable Cure Period.     

At the end of 2016, we will be subject to pay an exit fee of $3.5 million to Rusnano should we decide to cease the operations of our subsidiaries in Russia, provided that the cumulative investments and spending including the tangible asset transfers, other than intangible asset transfers which is limited to a maximum valuation of $5.7 million, exceed $10.0 million.

Table of Contents     

At the end of 2019, we will be subject to pay an exit fee of $2.0 million to Rusnano should we decide to cease the operations of our subsidiaries in Russia, if the cumulative investments and spending are less than $30.0 million.     

In August 2016, we entered into a letter of agreement with Rusnano to agree to transfer a product line and incur expected costs of approximately $0.1 million by July 30, 2017. 

Separately, on December 18, 2014, we entered into a Commitment to file   a Registration Statement and Related Waiver of Registration Rights, whereby Rusnano waived certain registration rights in connection with a potential offering by us of shares of our common stock, and we committed to file with the SEC a resale registration statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of all shares of our common stock held by Rusnano, or the 2015 Registration Statement. We filed the 2015 Registration Statement on April 6, 2015 to register 4,972,905 shares of our common stock held by Rusnano. Rusnano also waived its demand registration rights under the original rights agreement and agreed to enter into a lock up agreement with us whereby it would agree not to sell any shares of our common stock, or engage in certain other transactions relating to our securities, for a period of 60 days from the filing date of the 2015 Registration Statement. Rusnano signed such lock up agreement with us on April 2, 2015. In connection with our public stock offering completed in the second quarter of 2015, or the 2015 Follow-On Offering, Rusnano entered into a separate lock up agreement with Needham   Company, LLC, the lead underwriter of the offering, whereby it agreed not to sell any shares of our common stock, or engage in certain other transactions relating to our securities, for a period of 180 days from May 21, 2015. Such lock up agreement expired in November 2015. We do not receive any proceeds from any sales of our common stock held by Rusnano. 

Cash flow discussion 

The table below sets forth selected cash flow data for the periods presented:  

Operating activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $21.1 million provided by operating activities in the same 2015 period. The increase was primarily attributable to a $21.5 million increase in cash flows from inventories primarily due to increases in shipments driven by customer demand and a $14.3 million increase in cash flows related to accounts payable due to timing of payments, partially offset by a $20.2 million decrease in cash flows from accounts receivable primarily driven by timing of billings and collections in the 2016 period, a $5.4 million decrease in cash flows from prepaid and other assets primarily due to a reduction in prepaid taxes in the 2015 period that did not recur in 2016 and a $4.1 million decrease in cash flows related to accrued and other liabilities primarily due to variable compensation payments in the 2016 period. 

Investing activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $35.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16.1 million provided by investing activities in the same 2015 period. Cash used increased primarily attributable to a $40.6 million increase in marketable securities purchases, a $18.9 million increase in property, plant and equipment purchases to meet our product demand and a $10.0 million increase largely attributable to a reduction in restricted cash in the 2015 period as a result of the modification of our credit agreement with the Comerica Bank, partially offset by a   

39 

Table of Contents     

$36.0 million increase in proceeds from sales of marketable securities and a $14.4 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. 

We expect to invest approximately $50 million in property, plant and equipment purchases in 2016 as we expand our capacity to meet product demand. 

Financing activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $29.4 million provided by financing activities in the same 2015 period. The decrease was largely due to a $45.6 million net proceeds from our public stock offering completed in the 2015 period, a $3.9 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of notes payable and a $1.9 million increase in repayment of bank and acquisition-related loans, partially offset by a $14.9 million increase in proceeds from bank borrowings, a $6.0 million reduction in repayment of notes payable, a $3.9 million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan driven by higher stock price of our common stock and a $0.6 million increase in proceeds from government grants. 

Contractual obligations and commitments  

As of September 30, 2016, our principle commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases, purchase commitments, debt and other contractual obligations. Except for the new office lease in San Jose, California we executed in September 2016, there have been no significant changes to these obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the contractual obligations disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements except for two letters of credit, totaling $1.3 million, outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  

Recent accounting pronouncements  

See Note 1  Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies  in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements on this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes.  

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

Effective July 1, 2016, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily related to RMB and JPY, on our inter-company receivables and payables. Our exposures to other market risk have not changed materially since   December 31, 2015  . For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it   

40 

Table of Contents     

files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   

Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls  

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely.  Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances.  In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION    

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

From time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies engaged in our line of business, including commercial disputes and employment issues. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than as described below, we are not involved in any pending legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, as described below, a certain dispute involves a claim by a third party that our activities infringe their intellectual property rights. This and other types of intellectual property rights claims generally involve the demand by a third party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay substantial damages or royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property. Claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third-party intellectual property rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers) often involve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Moreover, from time to time, we may pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex intellectual property litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel which could adversely affect our business.  

For a discussion of our current legal proceedings, please refer to the information set forth under the  Litigation  section in Note 10,   Commitments and Contingencies  , in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 1A.      RISK FACTORS    

Except for those risk factors denoted by an asterisk (*), the risk factors facing our company have not changed materially from those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016, which risk factors are set forth below. 

Risks related to our business 

*We are dependent on Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., Ciena, Nokia and our other key customers for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from any of our key customers may reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations. 

Historically, we have generated   most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., together with its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. (collectively  Huawei ), and Ciena Corporation accounted for approximately 49% and 15% of our revenue, respectively, and our top ten customers represented 91% of our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Huawei and Ciena Corporation accounted for approximately 44% and 21% of our revenue, respectively, and our top ten customers represented 91% of our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2014, Huawei, Ciena Corporation, and Nokia Corporation accounted for 38%, 15% and 10% of our revenue, respectively, and our top ten customers represented 88% of our revenue.   As a result, the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from these major customers or any of our other key customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, the industry in which our customers operate is subject to a trend of consolidation. To the extent this trend continues, we may become dependent on even fewer customers to maintain and grow our revenue. Adverse events, including but not limited to any bankruptcy reorganization, affecting our customers could also adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 

Manufacturing problems could impact manufacturing yields or result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation. 

We may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, which could adversely impact manufacturing volumes, yields or delay product shipments. As a result, we could incur additional costs   

42 

Table of Contents     

that would adversely affect our gross margin, and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue, competitive position and reputation. 

Additionally, manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the stability and manufacturability of the product design, manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes, the quality and consistency of component parts and the nature and extent of customization requirements by customers. Capacity constraints, raw materials shortages, logistics issues, labor shortages, volatility in utilization of manufacturing operations, supporting utility services and other manufacturing supplies, the introduction of new product lines, rapid increases in production demands and changes in customer requirements, manufacturing facilities or processes, or those of some third party contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have historically caused, and may in the future cause, reduced manufacturing yields, negatively impacting the gross margin on, and our production capacity for, those products. Moreover, an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before, during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields, gross margin and production capacity. Our ability to maintain sufficient manufacturing yields is particularly challenging with respect to PICs due to the complexity and required precision of a large number of unique manufacturing process steps. Manufacturing yields for PICs can also suffer if contaminated materials or materials that do not meet highly precise composition requirements are inadvertently utilized. Because a large portion of our PIC manufacturing costs are fixed, PIC manufacturing yields have a substantial effect on our gross margin. Lower than expected manufacturing yields could also delay product shipments and decrease our revenue. It can be hard to cost-effectively increase our production output rapidly, and we can experience yield loss and excess material scrap, which can increase our cost of goods sold and harm our profitability. Also, if we do not have sufficient demand for our PIC-based products our cost of goods sold can increase as the fixed costs of our fabrication facilities are spread over lower production. 

We depend upon outside contract manufacturers for a portion of the manufacturing process for some of our products. Our operations and revenue related to these products could be adversely affected if we encounter problems with a contract manufacturer. 

The majority of our products are manufactured internally. However, we also rely upon contract manufacturers in Thailand, China, Japan and other Asia locations to provide back-end manufacturing and produce the finished portion of some of our products. Our reliance on contract manufacturers for these products makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over their supply chains, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, manufacturing quality/controls and costs. If one of our contract manufacturers is unable to meet all of our customer demand in a timely fashion, this could have a material adverse effect on the revenue from our products. If the contract manufacturer for one of our product were unable or unwilling to manufacture such product in required volumes and at high quality levels or to continue our existing supply arrangement, we would have to identify, qualify and select an acceptable alternative contract manufacturer or move these manufacturing operations to our internal manufacturing facilities. Any significant interruption in manufacturing our products would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers, which in turn would reduce our revenue, harm our relationships with the customers of these products and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities. 

We are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our gross margins. 

The communications networks industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time, resulting from increased competition, overcapacity and the introduction of new products. We have reduced the prices of many of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future, including from our major customers. When seeking to maintain or increase their market share, our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products. In addition, our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge, which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices. If we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume, reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products, our gross margin would be adversely affected.

*We are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our market growth plan in China. 

Fiber optics telecommunication growth in China is important to our success. Over the next two years, we expect to derive a significant portion of     our revenue growth from China infrastructure spending in wireline and wireless networks, notably from the three largest China telecom carriers, China Mobile Communications Corporation, China Telecommunications Corporation and China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd. In part, this infrastructure spending originates from the publicly announced China Broadband 2020 National Initiative. If the anticipated spending and related carrier large tender awards do not materialize as anticipated, or if there are unanticipated delays in the Chinese initiative, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected. 

*If the Metro and datacenter market sectors do not grow as rapidly as we expect, or if demand for our products in these sectors is lower than we expect, our growth may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer as a result. 

We expect that our future growth in the market for 100G and beyond coherent products to be driven in large part by the increased adoption of our high-speed products in the Metro market segment and in the high-performance datacenter market. Over the last sever  al years, 100G and beyond coherent technology has seen increasing adoption in the Long Haul market segment but has only recently begun to penetrate the much larger Metro sector of the market. Additionally, because the datacenter market has only recently emerged, may be more cost-sensitive and the requirements and relative scale may change rapidly and diverge from typical Metro networks. 

If we are unable to achieve or sustain a leadership position in the Long Haul telecom sector and use our position in that market to penetrate t  he Metro and datacenter segments, if these segments fail to grow as expected, or if demand for our products in the Metro and datacenter market segments fails to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would suffer. 

We face intense competition which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share. 

The communications networks industry is highly competitive. Our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in niche markets.  

Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, technical, financial, and marketing resources, and greater manufacturing capacity, as well as better-established relationships with customers, than we do. Some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire, and more experience in developing or acquiring, new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these products and technologies. Some of our competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than us and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or which provide more functionality than ours. In addition, some of our competitors have the financial resources on business strategy to offer competitive products at below-market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively and result in a loss of sales or market share or cause us to lower prices for our products. 

In particular we   have developed new technologies and products that we believe are key components in our customers  systems for 100Gbps and beyond   data transmission. The emergence of technologies and products from our competitors and their success in competing against our technologies and products for 100Gbps data transmission could render our existing products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. 

We also face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally, including Huawei. Due to the fact that such customers are not seeking to make a comparable profit directly from the manufacture of these products, they may have the ability to provide competitive products at a lower total cost than we would charge such customers. As a result, these customers may purchase less of our products and there would be additional pressure to lower our selling prices which, accordingly, would negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. 

Intense competition in our markets could result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including aggressively pricing their products or selling older inventory at a discount. If our current or future competitors utilize   

44 

Table of Contents     

aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our products could decline, we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders, or we could be required to reduce our sales prices. 

If we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer. 

Our success and ability to implement our business strategy depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and others, including senior management in foreign subsidiaries and our technical and operations employees in all locations. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management and others. The loss of services of members of our senior management team or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Competition for highly skilled technical and operations people where we operate is extremely intense, and we continue to face challenges identifying, hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business. If we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel, our business could suffer. 

If spending for communications networks does not continue to grow as expected, our business and financial results may suffer. 

Our future success as a provider of modules and subsystems to leading network equipment vendors depends on their continued capital spending on global communications networks. Network traffic has experienced rapid growth driven primarily by bandwidth-intensive content, including cloud services, mobile video and data services, wireless 4G/LTE and 5G services, social networking, video conferencing and other multimedia. This growth is intensified by the proliferation of fixed and wireless devices that are enabling consumers to access content at increasing data rates anytime and anywhere. Our future success depends on continued demand for high-bandwidth, high-speed communications networks and the ability of network equipment vendors and carrier datacenter operators to fulfill this demand. We cannot be certain that demand for bandwidth-intensive content will continue to grow in the future. If expectations for growth of communications networks and bandwidth consumption are not realized and investment in communications networks does not grow as anticipated, our business could be harmed. 

Customer demand is difficult to accurately forecast and, as a result, we may be unable to optimally match production with customer demand, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 

We make planning and spending decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers, and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products, reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate higher or more restrictive procurement commitments, increase our manufacturing yield loss and scrapping of excess materials, result in delayed shipments and/or reduce our gross margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, and we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing operations on a timely basis to meet increasing customer demand. Additionally, one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. Conversely, a downturn in the markets in which our customers compete can cause, and in the past have caused, our customers to significantly reduce or delay the amount of products ordered from us or to cancel existing orders, leading to lower utilization of our facilities. Because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, reduction in customer demand due to market downturns or other reasons would have a material adverse effect on our gross margin, operating income and cash flow.  

*The majority of our customer contracts do not commit customers to specified buying levels, and many of our customers may decrease, cancel or delay their buying levels at any time with little or no advance notice to us. 

Our products are typically sold pursuant to individual purchase orders or by use of a vendor-managed inventory, or VMI, model, which is a process by which we ship agreed quantities of products to a customer-designated location and   

45 

Table of Contents     

those products remain our inventory and we retain the title and risk of loss for those products until the customer takes possession of the products. While our customers generally provide us with their demand forecasts and may give us a promised market share award, they are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience wide fluctuations in demand from customers using VMI, particularly Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and their affiliate HiSilicon   Technologies Co., Ltd.  , even in instances where we have built and shipped products to the customer-designated locations as VMI. In recent periods, there has been an increase in the number of our customers utilizing VMI, which may increase our exposure to risks of wide fluctuations in demand from VMI customer locations. If any of our major customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, our business and results of operations would be harmed. Cancellation or delays of such orders, as well as fluctuations in VMI utilization by our customers, may cause us to incur an adverse effect on our revenues, as well as adversely affect our overall results of operations. 

*If we fail to adequately manage our growth and expansion, our business and financial results will suffer. 

In recent years, we have experienced significant growth through, among other things, internal manufacturing and related expansion programs, product development and acquisitions of other businesses and products. Our business has expanded to numerous locations, including foreign locations, and as a result has become more complex, more demanding of management s attention and subject to new laws and regulations. This growth has placed, and any future growth may place, a significant strain on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we fail to comply with new laws and regulations related to the expansion of our business, our business could suffer. 

We intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets, which could require us to expand our manufacturing operations, expend capital on manufacturing equipment, hire new personnel, lease or purchase additional facilities, developing the management infrastructure and developing our suppliers to manage any such expansion. Our current and planned operations, personnel, IT and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth   and may require us to make additional unanticipated investment in our infrastructure. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage these changes in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures. This could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increased costs, difficulties in introducing new offerings, or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely affect our business and reputation. 

Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and quickly respond to evolving technologies and customer requirements. 

The communications networks industry is characterized by substantial investment in new technology and the development of diverse and changing technologies and industry standards. For example, new technologies are required to satisfy the emerging standards for 100Gbps to 400 Gbps and beyond data transmission in communications networks. 

Our ability to anticipate and respond to evolving technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and technologies, will be critical factors in our ability to succeed. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to such changes in the future, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In addition, the introduction of new products by other companies embodying new technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards, could render our existing products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. 

We must continually achieve new design wins and enhance existing products or our business and future revenue may be harmed. 

The markets for our products are characterized by frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards, all with an underlying pressure to reduce cost and meet stringent reliability and qualification requirements. Our future performance will depend on our successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these challenges. The anticipated or   

46 

Table of Contents     

actual introduction of new and enhanced products by us and by our competitors may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or our competitors could result, and in the past, has resulted, in a slowdown in demand for our existing products and could result, and in the past, has resulted, in a write-down in the value of inventory. We have both recently and in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products and delays in new product development, and such delays may occur in the future. To the extent customers defer or cancel orders for our products for any reason or we fail to achieve new design wins, our competitive position would be adversely affected and our ability to grow revenue would be impaired. 

Furthermore, fast time-to-market with new products can be critical to success in our markets. It is difficult to displace an existing supplier for a particular type of product once a network equipment vendor has chosen a supplier, even if a later-to-market product provides superior performance or cost efficiency. If we are unable to make our new or enhanced products commercially available on a timely basis, we may lose existing and potential customers and our financial results would suffer. 

The development of new, technologically-advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring frequent innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development personnel and significant capital, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. Further, we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product introductions by competitors, technological changes or emerging industry standards. We also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, license these technologies from third parties, or remain competitive in our markets. 

*We may be exposed to costs or losses from product lines that we intend to end the production, including certain of our laser and PON products.  

In August 2016, we announced our intention to reduce the volume and end the production of certain of our lower-margin laser and PON products within a year of August 2016. These products have been declining in revenue and have lower gross margins than our other higher speed products. We may incur additional costs in connection with the sale or end-of-life of these products, or other products and/or facilities in the future, and our revenues and net income could be negatively affected, particularly in the short term, in connection with the end-of-life or sales of such products and/or facilities.  It is also possible that we could incur continued costs or liabilities after the end-of-life process is completed, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. 

We have had a history of losses which may recur in the future. 

We have had a history of losses and we may incur additional losses in future periods. As of September 30, 2016, our accumulated de  ficit was $300.7   million. We also expect to continue to make significant expenditures related to the ongoing operation and development of our business. These include expenditures related to the sales, marketing and development of our products and to maintain our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations. 

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the markets in which we compete and any future downturn may reduce demand for our products and revenue. 

The markets in which we compete are tied to the aggregate capital expenditures of telecommunications service providers as they build out and upgrade their network infrastructure. These markets are cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving standards and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. In the past, including recently to varying degrees in China, the U.S. and Europe, these markets have experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, the maturation of product cycles for both manufacturers  and their customers  products or in response to over or under purchasing of inventory by our customers relative to ultimate carrier demand, and with declining general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices.  To respond to a downturn, many service providers may slow their capital expenditures, cancel or delay new developments, reduce their workforces and inventories and take a cautious approach to acquiring   

47 

Table of Contents     

new equipment and technologies from original equipment manufacturers, which would have a negative impact on our business. 

Our historical results of operations have been subject to substantial fluctuations, and we may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future results of operations. Any future downturn in the markets in which we compete could significantly reduce the demand for our products and therefore may result in a significant reduction in revenue. Our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical changes in the markets utilizing our products. 

We face a variety of risks associated with international sales and operations, which if not adequately managed could adversely affect our business and financial results. 

We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from international sales in various markets. In addition, a major portion of our operations is based in Shenzhen and Dongguan, China as well as our having additional operations in Japan, Russia and Canada. Our international revenue and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including, but not limited to: 

difficulties in staffing, managing and supporting operations in more than one country;     

difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;     

fewer legal protections for intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;     

compliance with local regulations;     

foreign and U.S. taxation issues and international trade barriers;     

general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate;     

difficulties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain foreign jurisdictions;     

imposition of export restrictions on sales to any of our major foreign customers;     

fluctuations in foreign economies;     

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;     

trade and travel restrictions;     

outbreaks of contagious disease;     

domestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions; and     

difficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Negative developments in any of these areas in China, Japan, Russia or other countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business.     

In addition, although we maintain an anti-corruption compliance program throughout our company, violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.    

*Failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our planned expansion in the Russian Federation may affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 

In connection with our raising capital in an April 2012 private placement of common stock, we have established a wholly-owned subsidiary and company operations in the Russian Federation. The establishment of successful operations   

48 

Table of Contents     

in the Russian Federation requires capital expenditure over several years, and is in part dependent on the cooperation of Russian entities that could include the Russia government and other third parties. If there are delays in our efforts to establish operations in the Russian Federation, the anticipated benefits of our Russian expansion may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. The anticipated benefits of our Russian expansion could be materially reduced by a number of factors, including the following: 

the future revenue and gross margins of products produced in the Russian Federation may be materially different from those we originally anticipated;     

we could incur material unanticipated expenses; and     

we could have difficulty managing a business in the Russian Federation, where we did not previously have a material business presence.     

In addition, in connection with the private placement transaction, we entered into a rights agreement with Rusnano. Pursuant to the rights agreement, we have agreed to make a $30.0 million investment towards our Russian operations. We are currently required to satisfy this total investment commitment over a period from 2012 to 2019. Pursuant to the rights agreement, failure to perform our investment commitments for specific years within this time period may result in an obligation to pay damages to Rusnano, up to a maximum amount of penalties and exit fee of $3.5 million.   Although we met our investment commitment for 2015, certain required equipment was delivered but not fully installed and operational as of the required date to fulfill certain manufacturing milestones under the rights agreement. We remediated these issues and, in August 2016, entered into the second amendment to the rights agreement with Rusnano (the  Amended Rights Agreement ) to address this matter. The amendment extended the foregoing manufacturing deadlines to June 30, 2016 and confirmed that we had completed these milestones as of June 30, 2016. However, if we are unable to fulfill our remaining milestones for 2016-2019 as set forth in the Amended Rights Agreement and Rusnano seeks to enforce the penalty provision, it is possible that we could be forced to pay Rusnano penalty and/or exit fees of up to $3.5 million. In addition, we have entered into a letter of agreement with Rusnano to agree to transfer a product line and incur expected costs of approximately $0.1 million by July 30, 2017. 

Our business operations conducted in Russia are relatively small compared to our overall business  . A portion of our property, plant and equipment was located in Russia. We expect to make further investments in Russia in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are to a degree subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in Russia. In recent years the Russian Federation has undergone substantial political, economic and social change. The business, legal and regulatory infrastructure in the Russian Federation is less well-developed that would generally exist in a more mature free market economy. In addition, the tax, currency and customs legislation within the Russian Federation is subject to varying interpretations and changes, which can occur frequently. The future economic direction of the Russian Federation remains largely dependent upon the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the government, together with tax, legal, regulatory and political developments. Our failure to manage the risks associated with our planned Russian expansion could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations. 

We could be adversely affected by any actions taken by Russia in response to U.S. or international sanctions, including but not limited to actions such as restrictions placed by Russia on U.S. companies doing business in Russia. 

The occurrence of any or all of these events may have an adverse effect on our business, and results of operations and financial condition. 

Our revenues and costs will fluctuate over time, making it difficult to predict our future results of operations.   

Our revenue, gross margin and results of operations have varied significantly and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. For instance, changes in gross margin may result from various factors, such as changes in pricing, changes in our fixed costs, changes in the cost of labor, changes in the mix of our products sold, changes in the amount of product manufactured versus the amount of product sold over time, and charges for excess and obsolete inventory. In addition, our first quarter revenue is generally seasonally lower than the rest of the year primarily due to lower capacity utilization during the holidays in China and the   

49 

Table of Contents     

impact of typical price negotiations during the fourth quarter. It is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross margin and plan expenses accordingly and, therefore, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. 

Increasing costs may adversely impact our gross margins. 

We may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margins because of slow introductions of new products, pricing pressure from increased competition, failure to effectively reduce the cost of existing products, failure to improve our product mix, future macroeconomic or market volatility reducing sales volumes, changes in customer demand (including a change in product mix among different areas of our business) or other factors. Our gross margins can also be adversely affected for reasons including, but not limited to, fixed manufacturing costs that would not be expected to decrease in proportion to any decrease in revenues; unfavorable production yields or variances; increases in costs of input parts and materials; the timing of movements in our inventory balances; warranty costs and related returns; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; possible exposure to inventory valuation reserves; and other increases   in our costs and expenses, including as a result of rising labor costs in China  .    Such significant increases in costs without corresponding increases in revenue would materially and adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition and our gross margins.    

We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders. 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash flows from our operating activities and funds available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We operate in an industry, however, that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to continue operations or execute on our current or future business strategies, including to: 

invest in our research and development efforts, including by hiring additional technical and other personnel;     

maintain and expand our operating or manufacturing infrastructure;     

acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies; or     

otherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures.     

If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take   advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. In addition, a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. and we may not be able to repatriate off-shore cash to the U.S. without taxes that may     be substantial. Furthermore, in the event adequate capital is not available to us as required, or is not available on favorable terms, our   business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. 

If we incur additional indebtedness through arrangements such as credit agreements or term loans, such arrangements may impose restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to respond appropriately to market conditions, make capital investments or take advantage of business opportunities. In addition, any additional debt arrangements we may enter into would likely require us to make regular interest payments, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 

If our customers do not qualify our products for use, then our results of operations may suffer. 

50 

Table of Contents     

Prior to placing volume purchase orders with us, most of our customers require us to obtain their approval called qualification in our industry of our new and existing products, and our customers often audit our manufacturing facilities and perform other vendor evaluations during this process. The qualification process involves product sampling and reliability testing and collaboration with our product management and engineering teams in the design and manufacturing stages. If we are unable to qualify our products with customers, then our revenue would be lower than expected and we may not be able to recover the costs associated with the qualification process which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

In addition, due to evolving technological changes in our markets, a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we have qualified our product or begun volume manufacturing of a qualified product. It is unlikely that we would be able to recover the expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects. It is difficult to predict with any certainty whether our customers will delay or terminate product qualification or the frequency with which customers will cancel or modify their projects, but any such delay, cancellation or modification would have a negative effect on our results of operations. 

In particular, we have developed new technologies and products that we believe are key components in our customers  systems for 100Gbps and beyond data transmission. There are multiple modulation approaches for these systems and not all are likely to be equally successful. While we are shipping certain products for 100Gbps and beyond system designs today, many of our products for these systems are currently being qualified for use by our customers. Our ability to successfully qualify and scale capacity for these new technologies and products is important to our ability to grow our business and market presence. If we are unable to qualify and sell any of these products in volume on time, or at all, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 

We have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions. Acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and impair our financial results. 

As part of our business strategy, we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services or technologies that we believe could accelerate our ability to compete in our existing markets or allow us to enter new markets. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. For instance, in October 2011, we completed the acquisition of Santur Corporation, a designer and manufacturer of InP-based PIC products, and in March 2013 we completed the acquisition of the optical semiconductor business unit of LAPIS Semiconductor Co., Ltd., now known as NeoPhotonics Semiconductor. We purchased the tunable laser product lines of EMCORE in January 2015 and the power monitoring products business of EigenLight Corporation, or Eigenlight, in November 2015. If we fail to properly evaluate or integrate acquisitions, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. 

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including: 

difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting and personnel of the target company;     

difficulties in realizing our expectations for the financial performance of the target company;     

difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the target company;     

difficulties in managing and integrating different cultures with respect to our international acquisitions;     

dependence or reliance on subcontractors or suppliers to the acquired company that may not have been fully qualified or evaluated for their position in supplying the acquired company previously;     

diversion of management time and potential business disruption;     

the incurrence of debt to provide capital for any cash-based acquisitions;     

the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;     

51 

Table of Contents     

risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;     

potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the target company s business;     

assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the target company s products;     

exposure to environmental liabilities that have not yet been discovered associated with acquired businesses  facilities;     

expenses, distractions and actual or threatened claims or litigation resulting from acquisitions, whether or not they are completed;     

unexpected capital expenditure requirements;     

inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset increased expenses association with any acquisition;     

issues arising from weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting for acquired businesses that were not previously subject to internal control requirements of a U.S. public company;     

in the event of international acquisitions, risks associated with accounting and business practices that are different from applicable U.S. practices and requirements;     

dilutive effect on our stock as a result of any equity-based acquisitions;     

incurring potential write-offs, contingent liabilities and amortization expense; and     

opportunity costs of committing capital to such acquisitions.     

The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results. 

Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments which have occurred in the past and which, were they to occur in the future, could harm our financial results. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results. 

It could be discovered that our products contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention, result in a loss of customers and result in product liability claims. 

Our products are complex and undergo quality testing as well as formal qualification, both by our customers and by us. However, defects may occur from time to time. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. Any significant product failure could result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as customer relations problems, litigation and damage to our reputation. 

In addition, our products are typically embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, our customers  products, which incorporate a variety of components, modules and subsystems and may be expected to interoperate with modules produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately detectable and when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems or loss of customers, all of which would harm our business.

The occurrence of any defects in our products could give rise to liability for damages caused by such defects. They could, moreover, impair our customers  acceptance of our products. Both could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we carry product liability insurance which covers this risk, this insurance may not adequately cover our costs arising from defects in our products or otherwise. 

The communications networks industry has long product development cycles requiring us to incur product development costs without assurances of an acceptable investment return. 

The communications networks industry is highly capital-intensive. Large volumes of equipment and support structures are installed with considerable expenditures of funds and other resources, and long investment return period expectations. At the component supplier level, these cycles create considerable, typically multi-year, gaps between the commencement of new product development and volume purchases. Accordingly, we and our competitors often incur significant research and development and sales and marketing costs for products that, initially, will be purchased by our customers long after much of the cost is incurred and, in some cases, may never be purchased due to changes in industry or customer requirements in the interim. 

Due to changing industry and customer requirements, we are constantly developing new products, including seeking to further integrate functions on PICs and developing and using new technologies in our products. These development activities can and are expected to necessitate significant investment of capital. Our new products often require a long time to develop because of their complexity and rigorous testing and qualification requirements. Additionally, developing a manufacturing approach with an acceptable cost structure and yield for new products can be expensive and time-consuming. Due to the costs and length of research and development and manufacturing process cycles, we may not recognize revenue from new products until long after such expenditures are incurred, if at all, and our gross margin may decrease if our costs are higher than expected. 

While we rely on many suppliers, there are a few which, if they stopped, decreased or delayed shipments to us, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. 

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials we have qualified to use in the manufacture of certain of our products. Some of these suppliers could disrupt our business if they stop, decrease or delay shipments or if the components they ship have quality, consistency, or business continuity issues. Some of these components and materials are available only from a sole source, or have been qualified only from a single source. For example, we use various types of adhesives that are sourced from various manufacturers, which presently are sole sources for these particular adhesives. Furthermore, there are a limited number of entities from which we could obtain certain other components and materials. We may also face component shortages if we experience increased demand for components beyond what our qualified suppliers can deliver. We have experienced component shortages from certain key suppliers, which has resulted and, if this occurs in the future, may result in an inability to meet customer demand, higher purchasing costs, or both. Although we engage in various actions to mitigate the impact of these shortages, any inability on our part to obtain sufficient quantities of critical components at reasonable costs could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products, which could cause our revenue, results of operations, or both to suffer. 

Our customers generally restrict our ability to change the component parts in our modules without their approval. For more critical components, such as PICs, lasers and photo detectors, any changes may require repeating the entire qualification process. We typically have not entered into long-term or written agreements with our suppliers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products, and, therefore, our suppliers could stop supplying materials and equipment at any time or fail to supply adequate quantities of component parts on a timely basis. It is difficult, costly, time consuming and, on short notice, sometimes impossible for us to identify and qualify new component suppliers. The reliance on a sole supplier, single qualified vendor or limited number of suppliers could result in delivery and quality problems, reduced control over product pricing, reliability and performance and an inability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner. We have in the past had to change suppliers, which has, in some instances, resulted in delays in product development and manufacturing and loss of revenue. Any such delays in the future may limit our ability to respond to changes in customer and market demands. Any supply deficiencies relating to the quality, quantities or timeliness of delivery of components that we use to manufacture our products could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders and our results of operations.

We are subject to global governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability, impair our ability to compete in international markets, or restrict our sales to certain customers. 

We are subject to export and import control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products, especially laser-dependent products. In some cases, it is possible that export licenses would be required from the U.S. or other government agencies outside the U.S. such as, but not limited to, Japan, China or Russia for some of our products in accordance with various statutes. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export and import licenses. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products or to obtain any required licenses would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets, prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. For instance, if export restrictions or import restrictions were placed on any of our major customers, we could be restricted from selling our products to such customer(s), which could result in an immediate and material reduction in our sales to such customer(s) and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. In such event, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

If we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. 

Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations in the U.S. and in other foreign countries, some of which have been issued. We cannot guarantee that our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, our existing and future patents and trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or may be held invalid or unenforceable in court. A failure to obtain patents or trademark registrations or a successful challenge to our registrations in the U.S. or other foreign countries may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications and registrations intended to cover. 

Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections, and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. or Japan law. Particularly, our U.S. patents do not afford any intellectual property protection in China, Japan, Canada or other Asia locations where we have company operations, or in Russia, where we intend to expand operations. We seek to secure, to the extent possible, comparable intellectual property protections in China and other areas in which we operate. However, while we have issued patents and pending patent applications in China, portions of our intellectual property portfolio are not yet protected by patents in China. Moreover, the level of protection afforded by patent and other laws in countries such as China and Russia may not be comparable to that afforded in the U.S. or Japan. 

We attempt to protect our intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, through the use of trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants. We also use agreements containing confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions with other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions will not be breached, especially after our employees or those of our

third-party contract manufacturers end their employment or engagement, and that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products, otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property, or may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed or misappropriated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed. 

In the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel, which could significantly harm our business. In addition, we may not prevail in such proceedings. An adverse outcome of such proceedings may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business. 

We may be involved in intellectual property disputes in the future, which could divert management s attention, cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology. 

Participants in the markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous patents in these industries are held by others, including our competitors. In addition, from time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon intellectual property rights of other parties and/or meritorious defense would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, we cannot be certain that our products would not be found infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Intellectual property claims against us could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following: 

obtain from a third party claiming infringement a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms;     

stop manufacturing, selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property;     

pay substantial monetary damages; or     

expend significant resources to redesign the products that use the technology and to develop non-infringing technology.     

Any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time. 

In January 2010, Finisar Corporation, or Finisar, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and three other co-defendants. In the complaint, Finisar alleged infringement of certain of its U.S. patents arising from the co-defendants  respective manufacture, importation, use, sale of or offer to sell certain optical transceiver products in the U.S. In March 2010, we filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims, asserting two claims of patent infringement and additional claims asserting that Finisar has violated state and federal competition laws and violated its obligations to license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. In May 2010, the Court dismissed without prejudice all co-defendants (including us) except Source Photonics, Inc., on grounds that such claims should have been asserted in four separate lawsuits, one against each co-defendant. This dismissal without prejudice does not prevent Finisar from bringing a new similar lawsuit against us. In May 2012, we and Finisar agreed to toll our respective claims until the refiling of certain of the previously asserted claims from this dispute. As a result, Finisar is permitted to bring a new lawsuit against us if it chooses to do so, and we may bring new claims against Finisar upon seven days written notice prior to filing such claims. 

55 

Table of Contents     

If we are unsuccessful in our defense of the Finisar patent infringement claims, a license to use the allegedly infringing   technology may not be availa  ble on commercially reasonable terms and therefore may limit or preclude us from competing in the market for optical transceivers in the U.S., which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, and otherwise materially harm our business. 

Although we believe that we would have meritorious defenses to the infringement allegations and intend to defend any new similar lawsuit vigorously, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense. Even if we are successful, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs in defending the lawsuit. Further, a new lawsuit, if brought by either party, would be likely to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, which could harm our business. 

If we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual property rights of others which are necessary to operate our business, and to protect their intellectual property, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 

From time to time we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products. We cannot assure you that third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Generally, a license, if granted, would include payments of up-front fees, ongoing royalties or both. These payments or other terms could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. The inability to obtain a necessary third-party license required for our product offerings or to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or of greater cost, either of which could adversely affect our business. If we are not able to obtain licenses from third parties, if necessary, then we may also be subject to litigation to defend against infringement claims from these third parties. Our competitors may be able to obtain licenses or cross-license their technology on better terms than we can, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Also, we typically enter into confidentiality agreements with such third parties in which we agree to protect and maintain their proprietary and confidential information, including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information. There can be no assurance that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached by any of our employees or that such third parties will not make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed. 

*Participation in standards setting organizations may subject us to intellectual property licensing requirements or limitations that could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

In the course of our participation in the development of emerging standards for some of our present and future products, we have agreed to grant to all other participants a license to our patents that are essential to the practice of those standards on   reasonable and non-discriminatory, or RAND,   terms. As a result, in the future we may not always be able to limit to whom and, to a certain extent, on what terms we license our patents, and our control over and our ability to generate licensing revenue from some of our patents may be limited.  We have not received any requests for such licenses at this time. We may be required to license our patents or other intellectual property to others in the future.  We cannot guarantee that our essential patents will be an effective barrier to entry or that any patents and technology that we provide in such future licenses will not be used to compete against us. 

Any potential dispute involving our products, services or technology could also include our customers using our products, which could trigger our indemnification obligations to them and result in substantial expenses to us. 

In any potential dispute involving allegations that our products, services or technology infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our customers could also become the target of litigation. Because we often indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims made against them for products incorporating our technology, any claims against our customers could trigger indemnification obligations in some of our supply agreements, which could result in substantial expenses such as increased legal expenses, product recalls, damages for past infringement or royalties for future use. While we have not incurred any material indemnification expenses to date, any future indemnity claim could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and result in substantial costs to us. Our insurance does not cover intellectual property infringement.

Natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations and our financial results. 

Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For example, our corporate headquarters and wafer fabrication facility in Silicon Valley, California and our Tokyo, Japan facility are located near major earthquake fault lines, and our manufacturing facilities are located in Shenzhen and Dongguan, China, areas that are susceptible to typhoons. In the event that an earthquake, tsunami, typhoon, terrorist attack or other natural or man-made catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities, destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or the facilities or operations of our suppliers or customers for any extended period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. We are not insured against many natural disasters, including earthquakes. 

Similarly, our worldwide operations could be subject to secondary effects of natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. For instance, natural disasters and other business disruptions have created significant secondary effects in the past (such as the 2011 floods in Thailand and the 2011 earthquakes, tsunami and subsequent crisis relating to nuclear power facilities in Japan). Any of these types of events in the future could result in a slowdown of business or inability to manufacture products by our customers or others in the industry that are located in the affected areas; a disruption to the global supply chain for products manufactured in the affected areas that are included in the products either by us or by our customers; a disruption to manufacturing resulting from power shortages or other rationing of inputs to production; an increase in the cost of products that we purchase due to reduced supply; and other unforeseen impacts. These secondary effects could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Rapidly changing standards and regulations could make our products obsolete, which would cause our revenue and results of operations to suffer. 

We design our products to conform to regulations established by governments and to standards set by industry standards bodies worldwide, such as The American National Standards Institute, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the International Telecommunications Union and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Various industry organizations are currently considering whether and to what extent to create standards for elements used in 100Gbps and beyond systems. Because certain of our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards, if competing or new standards emerge that are preferred by our customers, we would have to make significant expenditures to develop new products. If our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible, or the industry groups adopt standards or governments issue regulations with which our products are not compatible, our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our revenue and results of operations would suffer. 

Failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our past and future acquisitions may affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 

In connection with our acquisitions of Santur, NeoPhotonics Semiconductor, EMCORE s tunable laser products and EigenLight s power monitor products, we have integrated the commercial operations and personnel into our existing infrastructure. If there are unexpected difficulties in our integration of these acquired businesses and/or the product lines we have acquired from EMCORE, the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. The anticipated benefits of these acquisitions could be materially reduced by a number of factors, including the following: 

the future revenue and gross margins of the acquired products may be materially different from those we originally anticipated;     

we could incur material unanticipated expenses;     

acquired products may not achieve the performance levels or specifications required by our customers;     

claims or lawsuits may arise from the acquisition transaction or from their previous business operations;     

57 

Table of Contents     

we may experience difficulties in managing inventory and other operational processes in facilities that we acquire or lease as a result of the acquisitions;     

we may experience difficulties in implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting as part of our integration actions, particularly since neither of these businesses were historically subject as a stand-alone entity to the internal control requirements of a U.S. public company;     

potential growth, expected financial results, perceived synergies and anticipated opportunities may not be realized through the ongoing integration actions;     

we may face competition from existing customers as well as new competitors;     

some existing customers of the acquired businesses may view our company as a competitor, and therefore may reduce or end their purchases of NeoPhotonics products for competitive reasons;     

a potential decline in revenues could occur from NeoPhotonics Semiconductor s legacy products for network applications that are declining within our customer base (such as NeoPhotonics Semiconductor s gallium arsenide integrated circuits for 10G network applications)     

we could have difficulty implementing and maintaining financial reporting requirements for the acquired business operations, which have not been previously audited nor subject to the internal compliance structure of a U.S. public company;     

we could incur additional costs associated with known and unknown environmental contamination of the real estate acquired from NeoPhotonics Semiconductor; and     

we could incur costs associated with new export or compliance issues associated with NeoPhotonics Semiconductor products or the product lines we recently acquired from EMCORE or EigenLight.     

The occurrence of any or all of these events may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Potential changes in our effective tax rate could negatively affect our future results. 

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., China, Japan and other various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including our ability to utilize our net operating losses. Increases in our effective tax rate could negatively affect our results of operations. 

*Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Japanese Yen (JPY) exchange rates. 

We are exposed to foreign exchange risks. Foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenue and our costs and expenses, and hence our results of operations. A substantial portion of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries based in China, whose functional currency is the RMB and Japan, whose functional currency is the JPY. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies and the value of the JPY against the U.S. dollar and other currencies fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. 

For example, the JPY appreciated by   16  % against the U.S. dollar in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, the People s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to manage fluctuations in RMB exchange rates and achieve policy goals. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Chinese government had allowed the RMB to devalue against the U.S. dollar by   approximately 6%.   It is difficult to predict how market forces or Chinese or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the Chinese government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. 

To the extent that transactions by our subsidiaries in China and Japan are denominated in currencies other than the   

58 

Table of Contents     

RMB and JPY, we bear the risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates of the RMB and JPY in relation to other currencies could decrease our revenue or increase our costs and expenses, therefore having an adverse effect on our future results of operations. 

While we generate a significant portion of our revenue in U.S dollars, a significant portion of our cost of goods sold are in RMB. Therefore appreciation in RMB against the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our cost of goods sold upon translation to U.S. dollars.  

We also transact in other currencies that have had historical volatility, including the Russian Rubles (RUB). Fluctuations in the exchange rates of these currencies may cause us to recognize additional transaction gains or losses which could impact our results of operations. While the RUB strengthened against the U.S. dollar by 14% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the related impact on our operating results has been immaterial. However, as we expect to expand our Russian operations, our risk associated with fluctuation of the RUB against the U.S. dollar could increase in the future. 

Effective July 1, 2016, we have entered into hedging transactions to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations. However, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure. In addition, our currency exchange variations may be magnified by Chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. 

If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. 

Preparing our consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and require significant management judgment. One or more of these elements may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. For instance, during 2013, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which resulted in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements for the first two quarters of 2013, which required us to file restatements of these financial statements. We subsequently remediated these material weaknesses, and our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of both 2014 and 2015. However, if material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.  

We may also experience difficulties in implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting as part of our integration of acquired businesses or products, particularly the product lines acquired from EMCORE or EigenLight. The product lines we acquired from EMCORE or EigenLight were not subject as a stand-alone entity to the internal control requirements of a U.S. public company. We could also experience unanticipated additional operating costs in implementing and managing effective internal controls over financial reporting or EMCORE or EigenLight operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 

If a material misstatement occurs in the future, we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations, we may need to restate our financial results and the price of our common stock may decline. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in the implementation, our business and operating results may be harmed and we may fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Any failure of our internal controls could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that is now applicable to us under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial   

59

reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly. 

We may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, cyber attacks, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner, customer and employee personal data. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Covenants in our credit facilities may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. 

We have lending arrangements with several financial institutions, including a revolving credit agreement with Comerica Bank in the U.S. Our U.S. revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants and limits our ability to take certain actions such as incurring some kinds of additional debt, paying dividends, or engaging in certain transactions like mergers and acquisitions, investments and asset sales without the lenders  consent.   

These restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities, competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions. In addition, our obligations under our U.S. revolving credit agreement with Comerica Bank are secured by substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property assets, which limit our ability to provide collateral for additional financing. A breach of any of these covenants, or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our indebtedness. 

We may be unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income taxes, which could adversely affect our future financial results. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes of $207.0 million and $69.2 million, respectively. As these net operating losses have not been utilized, a portion expired in 2015 and will continue to expire further in the current and future years. The utilization of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a substantial limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. We recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, for the NOL carryforwards currently available after considering the existing Section 382 limitation. If we incur an additional limitation under Section 382, then the NOL carryforwards, as   disclosed, could be reduced by the impact of any future limitation that would result in existing NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards expiring unutilized and increases in future tax liabilities. 

We are subject to government regulations that could adversely impact our business. 

The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over the entire U.S. telecommunications industry and, as a result, our products and our U.S. customers are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Current and future FCC regulations affecting communications services, our products or our customers  businesses could negatively affect our business. In addition, international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international customers in the future. Delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders. Further, we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may, in the future, be required to operate our business. Any failure to obtain such approvals could harm our business and results of operations.

Table of Contents     

We may utilize conflict minerals in our production or rely on suppliers who utilize conflict minerals in their production, and the use of such conflict minerals may negatively impact our results of operations. 

In August 2012, the SEC adopted its final rule to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding reporting obligations for the use of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, and beginning on January 1, 2013, we became subject to these reporting obligations and subsequently have   timely filed our conflict minerals reports with the SEC.   In connection with these requirements, we regularly communicate with customers and suppliers regarding the new conflict mineral rules and reporting obligations and continue to work with these customers and suppliers to implement any necessary or requested compliance programs. As a result of these new rules, our results in operations may suffer for a variety of reasons, including: 

difficulty in obtaining supplies that are conflict-free;     

shipping delays or the cancellation of orders for our products;     

costs associated with the implementation of the conflict minerals reporting obligations; and     

reputational damage in the event that we determine our products do incorporate conflict minerals or cannot be verified as not incorporating conflict minerals.     

In some instances, we rely on third-party sales representatives to assist in selling our products, and the failure of these representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue. 

Although we primarily sell our products through direct sales to systems vendors, we also sell our products to some of our customers through third-party sales representatives. Many of our third-party sales representatives also market and sell competing products from our competitors. Our third-party sales representatives may terminate their relationships with us at any time, or with short notice. Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional third-party sales representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If our current third-party sales representatives fail to perform as expected, our revenue and results of operations could be harmed. 

We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could subject us to liabilities, increase our costs, or restrict our business or operations in the future. 

Our manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. Our failure to comply with present and future environmental, health or safety requirements, or the identification of contamination, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, monetary fines, civil or criminal penalties, or curtailment of operations. In addition, the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations, or other unanticipated events could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, require us to install costly pollution control equipment or incur other additional expenses, or require us to modify our manufacturing processes or the contents of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

With our acquisition of NeoPhotonics Semiconductor, we own and operate a semiconductor facility in Japan which is subject to local environmental laws and regulations, including the Japanese Environmental Quality Standards ( JEQS ) and the Water Pollution Control Law ( Water Law ), which includes provisions for periodic monitoring of groundwater quality. The JEQS provides guidelines for specified substances in groundwater, primarily including metals and volatile organic compounds, include some that are either used in our operations or have been used in our facilities in prior years. In addition, the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Law includes regulatory standards for many of the same substances regulated under the Water Law, some that are either used in our operations or have been used in our facilities in prior years. Should any of these regulated materials be detected in local water or soil, we could be subject to local law remedies, which could affect our ability to operate or could negatively affect our results of operations. 

Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHG, may also impact us. Additional climate change or GHG control requirements are under consideration at the federal level in the U.S. and in China.   

61 

Table of Contents     

Additional restrictions, limits, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions could increase our operating costs and, while it is not possible to estimate the specific impact any final GHG regulations will have on our operations, there can be no assurance that these measures will not have significant additional impact on us. 

Adoption of international labor standards may increase our direct labor costs. 

International standards of corporate social responsibility include strict requirements on labor work practices and overtime. As global service providers and their network equipment vendors adopt these standards, we have in the past incurred and may be required in the future to incur additional direct labor costs associated with our compliance with these standards.   

Risks related to our operations in China. 

Our business operations conducted in China are critical to our success. A significant portion of     our revenue in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was recognized from customers for whom we shipped products to a location in China. Additionally, a substantial portion of our net property, plant and equipment, approximately   32%   as of September 30, 2016, was located in China. We expect to make further investments in China in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are to a significant degree subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in China. 

Adverse changes in economic and political policies in China, or Chinese laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on business conditions and the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business. 

The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Despite reforms, the government continues to exercise significant control over China s economic growth by way of the allocation of resources, control over foreign currency-denominated obligations and monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Moreover, the laws, regulations and legal requirements in China, including the laws that apply to foreign-invested enterprises are relatively new and are subject to frequent changes. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws is uncertain. Any adverse changes to these laws, regulations and legal requirements, including tax laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, or the creation of new laws or regulations relating to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the Chinese government s recent crackdown on alleged antitrust violations and bribery of local officials by multinational companies could signal a broad trend toward elevated scrutiny of foreign corporations operating in the country. 

Furthermore, while China s economy has experienced rapid growth in the past 20 years, its rate of growth has slowed over the past several quarters. Any continuing or worsening slowdown could significantly reduce domestic commerce in China. An economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, a further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in China could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

Our cost advantage from having our manufacturing and part of our research and development in China may diminish over time due to increasing labor costs, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. 

The labor market in China, particularly in the manufacturing-heavy Southeast region of China where our manufacturing facilities are located, has experienced higher costs due to increased wages. We were required to pay additional employee benefits taxes beginning in late 2010 and were subject to increases in the minimum wage in each year from 2011   to 2016  . We expect that we will be subject to further increases in personnel costs and taxes in the future due to market conditions and/or government mandates. If labor costs in China continue to increase, our gross margins and profit margins and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, our competitive advantage against competitors with manufacturing in traditionally higher cost countries would be diminished.

*The termination, expiration or unavailability of our preferential income tax treatment in China may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 

Effective January 1, 2008, the China Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT law, imposes a single uniform income tax rate of 25% on all Chinese enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises, and eliminates or modifies most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatment available under the previous tax laws and regulations. As a result, our subsidiaries in China may be subject to the uniform income tax rate of 25% unless we are able to qualify for preferential status. Historically, we have qualified for a preferential 15% tax rate that is available for new and high technology enterprises. The preferential tax rate applied to 2015, 2014 and 2013. We realized benefits from this 10% reduction in tax rate of $  0.9     million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In order to retain the preferential tax rate, we must meet certain operating conditions, satisfy certain product requirements, meet certain headcount requirements and maintain certain levels of research expenditures. The preferential tax rate that we enjoyed could be modified or discontinued altogether at any time, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In June 2016, the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice to adjust the requirements for high technology enterprise status. As a result, as of September 30, 2016 we believe that it is more likely than not that our China subsidiary will not meet the requirements for the tax year 2016 and will be subject to a 25% regular income tax rate. 

Our subsidiaries in China may be subject to restrictions on dividend payments, on making other payments to us or any other affiliated company, and on borrowing or allocating tax losses among our subsidiaries. 

Current Chinese regulations permit our subsidiaries in China to pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations, which are different than U.S. accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund their statutory common reserves until such reserves have reached at least 50% of their respective registered capital, as well as to allocate a discretional portion of their after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus fund. As of   December 31, 2015, our   Chinese subsidiaries  common reserves had not reached this threshold and, accordingly, these entities are required to continue funding such reserves with accumulated net profits. The statutory common reserves are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. In addition, current Chinese regulations prohibit inter-company borrowings or allocation of tax losses among subsidiaries in China. Further, if our subsidiaries in China incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Accordingly, we may not be able to move our capital easily, which could harm our business. 

Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenue and cash effectively. 

Because a substantial portion of our revenue is denominated in RMB, any restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any business activities we may have outside China or to make dividend payments in U.S. dollars. Under relevant Chinese rules and regulations, the RMB is currently convertible under the  current account,  which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the  capital account,  which includes foreign direct investment and loans, without the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. Currently, our subsidiaries in China may purchase foreign exchange for settlement of  current account transactions,  including the payment of dividends to us, without the approval of SAFE. Although Chinese government regulations now allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions remain. For example, foreign exchange transactions under our primary Chinese subsidiary s capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain subject to significant foreign exchange controls and the approval of SAFE. These limitations could affect the ability of our subsidiaries in China to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures through debt or equity financing, including by means of loans or capital contributions from us. We cannot be certain that Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions. If such restrictions are imposed, our ability to adjust our capital structure or engage in foreign exchange transactions may be limited. 

In August 2008, SAFE promulgated the   Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement   

63 

Table of Contents     

of the Administration of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises  , or Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by foreign-invested enterprises or FIE of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires that RMB converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within China unless specifically provided for otherwise. Although Circular 142 was superseded by a more recent SAFE notice issued in March 2015 (known as the   Notice on Reforming the Methods on Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises  , or Notice 19), the aforementioned restriction under Circular 142 has been preserved in Notice 19. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of RMB funds converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE. The use of such RMB may not be changed without approval from SAFE. Violations of Notice 19 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. As a result of Notice 19 (as supplemented and adjusted by other regulations and notices issued by SAFE from time to time), our subsidiaries in China may not be able to convert our capital contributions to them into RMB for equity investments or acquisitions in China. 

The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. 

The M A Rules establish procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise. We may seek to expand our business in part by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the M A Rules to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. 

Uncertainties with respect to China s legal system could adversely affect the legal protection available to us. 

Our operations in China are governed by Chinese laws and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. China s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a legal system where decided legal cases have limited value as precedents. Since 1979, Chinese legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully-integrated legal system, and recently-enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties, including regional variations within China. For example, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection under contracts or law. However, since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contract terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we would receive compared to more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into with our distributors, business partners, customers and suppliers. In addition, protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions with more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the legal system in China is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. All the uncertainties described above could limit the legal protections available to us and could materially and adversely affect our business and operations. 

Chinese regulations relating to offshore investment activities by Chinese residents and employee stock options granted by overseas-listed companies may increase our administrative burden, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activity or otherwise adversely affect the implementation of our acquisition strategy. If our stockholders   

64 

Table of Contents     

who are Chinese residents, or our Chinese employees who are granted or exercise stock options, fail to make any required registrations or filings under such regulations, we may be unable to distribute profits and may become subject to liability under Chinese laws. 

Chinese foreign exchange regulations require Chinese residents and corporate entities to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. These regulations apply to our stockholders who are Chinese residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future. Pursuant to these foreign exchange regulations, Chinese residents who make, or have previously made, direct or indirect investments in offshore companies, will be required to register those investments. In addition, any Chinese resident who is a direct or indirect stockholder of an offshore company is required to file or update the registration with the local branch of SAFE, with respect to that offshore company, including any material change involving its round-trip investment, capital variation, such as an increase or decrease in capital, transfer or swap of shares, merger, division, long-term equity or debt investment or creation of any security interest. If any Chinese stockholder fails to make the required SAFE registration or file or update the registration, subsidiaries in China of that offshore parent company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation, to their offshore parent company, and the offshore parent company may also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into their subsidiaries in China. Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability under Chinese laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. We cannot provide any assurances that all of our stockholders who are Chinese residents have made or obtained, or will make or obtain, any applicable registrations or approvals required by these foreign exchange regulations. The failure or inability of our stockholders in China to comply with the required registration procedures may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, or limit our Chinese subsidiaries  ability to distribute dividends or obtain foreign-exchange-dominated loans. Moreover, because of the uncertainties in the interpretation and implementation of these foreign exchange regulations, we cannot predict how they will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we decide to acquire a domestic company in China, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by these foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

On March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the   Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Company  , or the Stock Option Rule. Under the Stock Option Rule, Chinese residents who are granted stock options by an overseas publicly-listed company are required, through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures. We and our Chinese employees who have been granted stock options are subject to the Stock Option Rule. We have completed the process of registering our stock option and appreciation plans with SAFE. On February 20, 2012, SAFE issued the Circular on Relevant Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Individuals in PRC Participating in Equity Incentive Plan of Overseas-Listed Companies, or Circular 7, which provides detailed procedures for conducting foreign exchange matters related to domestic individuals  participation in the equity incentive plans of overseas listed companies and supersedes the Stock Option Rule in its entirety. If we or our optionees in China fail to comply with the applicable regulations, we or our optionees in China may be subject to fines and legal sanctions. Several of our employees in China have exercised their stock options prior to our becoming an overseas publicly-listed company. Since there is not yet a clear regulation on how and whether Chinese employees can exercise their stock options granted by overseas private companies, it is unclear whether such exercises were permitted by Chinese laws and it is uncertain how SAFE or other government authorities will interpret or administer such regulations. Therefore, we cannot predict how such exercises will affect our business or operations. For example, we may be subject to more stringent review and approval processes with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

We may be obligated to withhold and pay individual income tax in China on behalf of our employees who are subject to individual income tax in China arising from the exercise of stock options. If we fail to withhold or pay such   

65 

Table of Contents     

individual income tax in accordance with applicable Chinese regulations, we may be subject to certain sanctions and other penalties and may become subject to liability under Chinese laws. 

The State Administration of Taxation has issued several circulars concerning employee stock options. Under these circulars, our Chinese employees (which could include both employees in China and expatriate employees subject to individual income tax in China) who exercise stock options will be subject to individual income tax in China. Our subsidiaries in China have obligations to file documents related to employee stock options with relevant tax authorities and withhold and pay individual income taxes for those employees who exercise their stock options. However, since there was not yet a clear regulation on how and whether Chinese employees could exercise stock options granted by overseas private companies and how Chinese employers shall withhold and pay individual taxes, the relevant tax authority verbally advised us that due to the difficulty in determining the fair market value of our shares as a private company, we did not need to withhold and pay the individual income tax for the exercises until after we completed our initial public offering in February 2011. Thus, we have not withheld or paid the individual income tax for the option exercises through the date of our initial public offering. However, we cannot be assured that the Chinese tax authorities will not act otherwise and request us to pay the individual income tax immediately and impose sanctions on us. 

If the Chinese government determines that we failed to obtain approvals of, or registrations with, the requisite Chinese regulatory authority with respect to our current and past import and export of technologies, or failed to obtain the necessary licenses to file patent applications outside China for inventions made in China, we could be subject to sanctions, which could adversely affect our business. 

China imposes controls on technology import and export. The term  technology import and export  is broadly defined to include, without limitation, the transfer or license of patents, software and know-how, and the provision of services in relation to technology. Depending on the nature of the relevant technology, the import and export of technology to or from China requires either approval by, or registration with, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities. Additionally, the Chinese government requires the patent application for any invention made at least in part in China to be filed first in China, which application then undergoes a government secrecy review, and then the Chinese government requires a license to be obtained before such application is filed in other countries. 

If we are found to be, or to have been, in violation of Chinese laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning, levying fines, restricting us from benefiting from these technologies inside or outside of China, confiscating our earnings generated from the import or export of such technology or even restricting our future export and import of any technology. If the Chinese government determines that our past import and export of technology were inconsistent with, or insufficient for, the proper operation of our business, we could be subject to similar sanctions. In addition, if the Chinese government determines that we failed to follow required procedures and obtain the appropriate license before filing a patent application outside China for an invention made at least in part in China, our China patents on such products may be invalidated. Any of these or similar sanctions could cause significant disruption to our business operations or render us unable to conduct a substantial portion of our business operations and may adversely affect our business and result of operations. 

China regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to China entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we received from our initial public offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our China subsidiaries. 

From time to time, we may make loans or additional capital contributions to our China subsidiaries. Any loans to our China subsidiaries are subject to China regulations and approvals. For example, any loans to our China subsidiaries to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits, must be registered with SAFE, or its local counterpart, and must be approved by the relevant government authorities. Any capital contributions to our China subsidiaries must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce of China or its local counterpart. In addition, under Circular 142, our China subsidiaries, as FIEs, may not be able to convert our capital contributions to them into RMB for equity investments or acquisitions in China. 

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our future loans or capital contributions to our China subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such   

66 

Table of Contents     

registrations or approvals, our ability to capitalize our China subsidiaries may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business. 

Dividends paid to us by our Chinese subsidiaries may be subject to Chinese withholding tax. 

The EIT Law and the implementation regulations provide that a 10% withholding tax may apply to dividends payable to investors that are  non-resident enterprises,  to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within China and in the absence of any tax treaty that may reduce such withholding tax rate. The comprehensive Double Taxation Arrangement between China and Hong Kong generally reduces the withholding tax on dividends paid from a Chinese company to a Hong Kong company to 5%. Dividends paid to us by our Chinese subsidiaries will be subject to Chinese withholding tax if, as expected, we are considered a  non-resident enterprise  under the EIT Law. If dividends from our Chinese subsidiaries are subject to Chinese withholding tax, our financial condition may be adversely impacted to the extent of such tax. 

Our worldwide income may be subject to Chinese tax under the EIT Law. 

The EIT Law provides that enterprises established outside of China whose  de facto management bodies  are located in China are considered  resident enterprises  and are generally subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax on their worldwide income. Under the implementation regulations for the EIT Law issued by the State Council, a  de facto management body  is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and treasury, and acquisition and disposition of properties and other assets of an enterprise. If we are deemed to be a resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes, we will be subject to Chinese tax on our worldwide income at the 25% uniform tax rate, which could have an impact on our effective tax rate and an adverse effect on our net income, however, dividends paid to us by our Chinese subsidiaries may not be subject to withholding if we are deemed to be a resident enterprise. 

Dividends payable by us to our investors and gains on the sale of our common stock by our foreign investors may be subject to tax under Chinese law. 

Under the EIT Law and implementation regulations issued by the State Council, a 10% withholding tax is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are  non-resident enterprises.  Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of common stock by such investors is also subject to a 10% withholding tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China. If we are determined to be a  resident enterprise,  dividends and other income we pay on our common stock, or the gain you may realize from the transfer of our common stock, would be treated as income derived from sources within China. If we are required under the EIT Law to withhold tax from dividends payable to investors that are  non-resident enterprises,  or if a gain realized on the transfer of our common stock is subject to withholding, the value of your investment in our common stock may be materially and adversely affected. 

Our contractual arrangements with our subsidiaries in China may be subject to audit or challenge by the Chinese tax authorities, and a finding that our subsidiaries in China owe additional taxes could substantially reduce our net income and the value of our stockholders  investment. 

Under the applicable laws and regulations in China, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the Chinese tax authorities. We would be subject to adverse tax consequences if the Chinese tax authorities were to determine that the contracts with or between our subsidiaries were not executed on an arm s length basis, and as a result the Chinese tax authorities could require that our Chinese subsidiaries adjust their taxable income upward for Chinese tax purposes. Such an adjustment could adversely affect us by increasing our tax expenses. 

Because a substantial portion of our business is located in China, we may have difficulty maintaining adequate management, legal and financial controls, which we are required to do in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and securities laws, and which could cause a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, the trading price of our common stock and our business.

Table of Contents     

Chinese companies have historically not adopted a western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. Most of our middle management staff and some of our top management staff in China are not educated and trained in the western system, and we may have difficulty hiring new employees in China with experience and expertise relating to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and U.S. public-company reporting requirements. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in maintaining management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet U.S. public-company reporting requirements. We may, in turn, experience difficulties in maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may result in material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any such material weaknesses or lack of compliance with SEC rules and regulations could result in restatements of our historical consolidated financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock, adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and our ability to recruit personnel, lead to the delisting of our securities from the stock exchange on which they are traded. This could lead to litigation claims, thereby diverting management s attention and resources, and which may lead to the payment of damages to the extent such claims are not resolved in our favor, lead to regulatory proceedings, which may result in sanctions, monetary or otherwise, and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. 

See also the risk factor  If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.  

Our consolidated affiliated entities in China are audited by auditors who are not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection. 

Publicly traded companies in the United States are audited by independent registered public accounting firms registered with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, and are required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Because the auditors of our consolidated affiliated entities in China are located in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, such auditors are not currently inspected by the PCAOB. On May 24, 2013, the PCAOB announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding on enforcement cooperation with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of China that establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations in the United States and China. However, direct PCAOB inspections of independent registered accounting firms in China are still not permitted by Chinese authorities. 

Inspections of auditing firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms  audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our Chinese auditor s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. 

The turnover of direct labor in manufacturing industries in China is high, which could adversely affect our production, shipments, and results of operations. 

Employee turnover of direct labor in the manufacturing sector in China is typically high and retention of such personnel is a challenge to companies located in or with operations in China. Although direct labor cost does not represent a high proportion of our overall manufacturing costs, direct labor is required for the manufacture of our products. If our direct labor turnover rates are higher than we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately manage our direct labor turnover rates, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Our subsidiaries in China are subject to Chinese labor laws and regulations. Changes to Chinese labor laws and regulations may increase our operating costs in China, which could adversely affect our financial results.

China Labor Contract Law, effective January 1, 2008, together with its implementing rules, effective September 18, 2008 and its amendments, effective July 1, 2013, provides certain protections to Chinese employees. Under the current rules, the probation period varies depending on contract terms and the employment contract can only be terminated during the probation period for cause upon three days  notice. Additionally, an employer may not be able to terminate a contract during the probation period on the grounds of a material change of circumstances or a mass layoff. The current law also has specific provisions on conditions when an employer has to sign an employment contract with open-ended terms. If an employer fails to enter into an open-ended contract in certain circumstances, the employer must pay the employee twice their monthly wage beginning from the time the employer should have executed an open-ended contract. Additionally an employer must pay severance for nearly all terminations, including when an employer decides not to renew a fixed-term contract. 

On January 1, 2008, the Regulations on Paid Annual Leaves of Staff and Workers also took effect, followed by its implementing measures effective September 18, 2008. These regulations provide that employees who have worked consecutively for one year or more are entitled to paid annual leave. An employer must guarantee that employees receive the same wage income during the annual leave period as that for the normal working period. Where an employer cannot arrange annual leave for an employee due to production needs, upon agreement with the employee, the employer must pay daily wages equal to 300% of the employee s daily salary for each day of annual leave forfeited by such employee. 

The Shenzhen municipal government, effective December 2010, issued a measure to require all government agencies, public institutions, and enterprises in Shenzhen to pay a monthly housing fund. The housing fund is designed to enhance the welfare and increase the funds available to Shenzhen employees when buying, building, renovating, or overhauling owner-occupied houses. Employee and employers are required to make equal contributions to the housing fund, which generally can range between 5% and 20% of the employees  average salary of the most recent year and we commenced making these contributions in the fourth quarter of 2010. 

From time to time, the Chinese government has implemented requirements to increase the minimum wage for employees in China. These requirements have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in higher employee costs for our personnel in China. Minimum wage rates generally vary by city and province within China and have historically increased as much as 20% on an annual basis. We were required to increase wages to comply with these requirements and it may be necessary for us to increase wages more than the minimum wage adjustment requires due to market conditions or additional government mandates. If labor costs in China continue to increase, our gross margins, profit margins and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, our competitive advantage against competitors with personnel costs or manufacturing in traditionally higher cost countries may be diminished. Future changes to labor laws and regulations may materially increase the costs of our operations in China. 

If any of our subsidiaries in China becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or liquidation procedures, we may lose or diminish the ability to use its assets. 

Because a substantial portion of our business and revenue are derived from China, if any of our subsidiaries in China goes bankrupt and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our operations in China. Any delay, interruption or cessation of all or a part of our operations in China would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and otherwise adversely affect our business. 

We may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and we make significant sales in China. China also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to discourage these practices by our employees, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may

engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. 

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in our stock price. 

Our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors, including: 

fluctuations in demand for our products;     

the timing, size and product mix of sales of our products;     

changes in our pricing and sales policies, particularly in the first quarter of the year, or changes in the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;     

our ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner and that meet customer requirements;     

quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations;     

our ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the components used in our products;     

length and variability of the sales cycles of our products;     

unanticipated increases in costs or expenses; and     

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.     

The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations in the future. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our internal manufacturing, research and development, sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. Moreover, our results of operations may not meet our announced financial outlook or the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks. 

Our stock price may be volatile. 

The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us. 

The stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, sovereign debt or liquidity issues, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.

Table of Contents     

If research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. 

The concentration of our capital stock ownership with our principal stockholders, executive officers and directors and their affiliates may limit other stockholders  ability to influence corporate matters. 

As of August 31, 2016, our executive officers and directors, and entities that are affiliated with them or that have a right to designate a director, beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 28% of our   outstanding common stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, as a result, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders. 

We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates. 

We currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our U.S. revolving credit agreement with Comerica Bank restrict our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you pay. 

Our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: 

providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;     

not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;     

authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock;     

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;     

limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and     

requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.     

In addition, we have been governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law since the completion of our initial public offering. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time. 

These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be   

71 

Table of Contents     

willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. 

Failure to comply with conditions required for our common stock to be listed on the NYSE could result in delisting of our common stock from the NYSE and have a significant negative effect on the value and liquidity of our securities as well as other matters. 

We are required to comply with the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a condition for our common stock to continue to be listed on the NYSE. If we are unable to comply with such conditions such as non-timely filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, then our shares of common stock are subject to delisting from the NYSE. 

If our common stock is delisted from the NYSE, such securities may be traded over-the-counter on the  pink sheets.  The alternative market, however, is generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, the NYSE. Accordingly, delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could have a significant negative effect on the value and liquidity of our securities. In addition, the delisting of such stock could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, delisting of our common stock may preclude us from using exemptions from certain state and federal securities regulations.

Retention Agreements with Certain Named Executive Officers  .   

We entered into retention agreements, with an effective date of August 5, 2016, providing for updated severance and change in control benefits with all five of our named executive officers: Timothy S. Jenks, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Clyde R. Wallin, our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President; Benjamin L. Sitler, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales; Dr. Chi Yue ( Raymond ) Cheung, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dr. Wupen Yuen, our Senior Vice President and General Manager.   

We entered into these arrangements after a review of existing arrangements by the compensation committee of our board of directors, with the committee taking into account market assessment data prepared by the committee s independent compensation consultant.  Each retention agreement amends and supersedes the prior severance rights agreement with each such named executive officer.   

The descriptions of the retention agreements provided below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual agreements, which are filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

72 

Table of Contents     

Involuntary termination generally  .  The retention agreements with each of our named executive officers provide for the following severance benefits on a termination without  cause  (excluding death or disability) or a voluntary resignation for  good reason  (each as defined in the retention agreement and as summarized below, and collectively referred to below as an  involuntary termination ):  

a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of:     

o 

a percentage of his base salary, which is 200% in the case of Mr. Jenks, Dr. Cheung and Dr. Yuen, and 100% in the case of Mr. Wallin and Mr. Sitler;     

o 

in the case of Mr. Jenks, 100% of his target annual bonus; and      

o 

a cash payment equal to $144,000 in the case of Mr. Jenks, Dr. Cheung and Dr. Yuen, and $72,000 in the case of Mr. Wallin and Mr. Sitler, which is intended to assist in the payment of (but not required for be used for) continued health insurance; and     

18 month s worth of any then-unvested accelerated vesting of compensatory equity awards providing for time-based vesting (but no waiver of any performance-based criteria, except for Mr. Jenks).      

Involuntary termination on or following a change in control  . The retention agreements also provide that upon an involuntary termination on or within 12 months following a  change in control  as described below, the named executive officers would receive the following severance benefits:  

a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of:     

o 

a percentage of his base salary, which is 200% in the case of Mr. Jenks, Dr. Cheung and Dr. Yuen, and 150% in the case of Mr. Wallin and Mr. Sitler;      

o 

a percentage of his target annual bonus, which is 200% in the case of Mr. Jenks, Dr. Cheung and Dr. Yuen, and 100% in the case of Mr. Wallin and Mr. Sitler; and      

o 

a cash payment equal to $144,000 in the case of Mr. Jenks, Dr. Cheung and Dr. Yuen, and $72,000 in the case of Mr. Wallin and Mr. Sitler, which is intended to assist in the payment of (but not required for be used for) continued health insurance; and     

100% accelerated vesting of then-unvested compensatory equity awards providing for time-based vesting (but no waiver of any performance-based criteria, except for Mr. Jenks).      

The retention agreement with Mr. Jenks also provides that if he is involuntarily terminated prior to a change in control and he can reasonably demonstrate to our board s satisfaction that such termination was at the request of a third party who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a change in control, then he will be entitled to the greater amount of severance benefits payable on an involuntary termination following a change in control. 

Accelerated vesting if no assumption of equity awards in a change in control  .  The retention agreements also provide that in the event of a change in control in which the acquirer does not assume outstanding and unvested equity awards, then the vesting of all then-unvested equity awards held by the named executive officer will accelerate as to the number of shares that would have vested in the ordinary course of business subject to continued service with us over the 18 month period following the closing of the change in control transaction.  This acceleration is in lieu of any automatic accelerated vesting provision triggered solely on the closing of a change in control transaction contained in our equity incentive plans. 

Certain death benefits  .  The retention agreements also provide for a supplemental cash payment, in addition to any death benefits payable under our life insurance policies, in the event that such named executive officer s employment   

73 

Table of Contents     

terminates due to his death while he is outside of his country of residence (for any reason), if necessary, so that the named executive officer s estate or beneficiaries receive total death benefits equal to 200% of his then-current annual base salary.  

Conditions to payment  .  A named executive officer is required to execute a general waiver and release of all employment related obligations and claims against us as a condition to receiving any benefits under his retention agreement.  The retention agreements do not obligate a named executive officer to mitigate losses by seeking other employment or otherwise, and the benefits under these agreements will not be reduced by compensation earned through employment by another employer.  In addition, Dr. Cheung s retention agreement clarifies that if he is entitled to receive severance benefits under applicable law, any cash severance benefits otherwise payable under his retention agreement will be reduced by the amounts legally required to be paid to him under applicable law.  Any benefits that are otherwise payable under the retention agreements that are deemed to be so-called  parachute payments  subject to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code are also subject to potential cutback in the manner provided in our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan if the named executive officer would be better off on an after tax basis following such cutback.   

Definitions  .  For purposes of the retention agreements entered into with our named executive officers, the following definitions apply:  

We will be deemed to have  cause  to terminate a named executive officer upon any of the following events: (i) any act of personal dishonesty taken by the named executive officer in connection with his responsibilities as an employee and intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of the named executive officer; (ii) the conviction of a felony; (iii) a willful act by the named executive officer that constitutes gross misconduct and which materially injures us; and (iv) following delivery to the named executive officer of a written demand for performance from us, which describes the basis for our belief that the named executive officer has not substantially performed his duties, continued violations by him of his obligations to us that are demonstrably willful and deliberate on the named executive officer s part. 

A  change in control  will be deemed to occur under these retention agreements in the event of any of the following events: (i) any person becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of our securities representing 50% or more of the total voting power represented by our then-outstanding voting securities, excluding sales of stock by the Company or in connection with certain financing transactions; (ii) the consummation of the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets; (iii) the consummation of a merger or consolidation with any other entity, other than a merger, consolidation or similar transaction that would result in our stockholders immediately prior thereto continuing to own voting securities representing at least 60% of the total voting power of such surviving entity (or its parent) outstanding immediately after such transaction; or (iv) certain changes affecting the majority of the directors of our board of directors.  

A termination by us will be deemed to be due to  disability  if the named executive officer has been unable to perform his duties as the result of his incapacity due to physical or mental illness, and such inability, at least 26 weeks after its commencement, is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by us or our insurers and acceptable to the named executive officer or his legal representative.  

A named executive officer will have  good reason  to resign following the occurrence (without the named executive officer s written consent) of any of the following events: (i) a material reduction or other material adverse change in the named executive officer s job duties, responsibilities, authority or requirements, including the removal of such job duties, responsibilities, authority or requirements; (ii) a material reduction of the named executive officer s annual base compensation (or target annual bonus in the case of Mr. Jenks); (iii) our requiring the named executive officer to move his primary work location to a location that increases his one-way commute by more than 50 miles (25 miles in the case of Mr. Jenks); or (iv) our failure to obtain the assumption, in all material respects, of the retention agreement by any of our successors; provided that the named executive officer must provide written notice to us of the existence of one of these conditions within 60 days after its initial existence, we fail to reasonably correct such event within 30 days, and he voluntarily resigns from all positions he holds within 30 days following the end of our 30-day cure period.  The retention agreement with Mr. Jenks also provides that he will have good reason to resign following any change which requires him to report to anyone other than our board, the board of directors of any successor company, or the board of directors of any parent company if we become a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company following a change in control.

Exhibit 10.10 

NINTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT 

This   Ninth Amendment to Credit Agreement   (this  Amendment ) is made as of September 30, 2016, by and among NeoPhotonics Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( Borrower ), Lenders (as defined below) and Comerica Bank, as administrative agent for Lenders (in such capacity,  Agent ). 

RECITALS 

A.    Borrower entered into that certain   Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of March 21, 2013 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the  Credit Agreement ), with certain financial institutions from time to time parties thereto (collectively,  Lenders ), Comerica Bank, as lead arranger, and Agent. 

B.  Borrower has requested that Agent and Lenders make certain amendments to the Credit Agreement and Agent and Lenders are willing to do so, but only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment. 

NOW, THEREFORE  , in consideration of the foregoing recitals and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Borrower, Agent and Lenders hereby agree as follows: 

1. 
			 The definition of  Revolving Credit Maturity Date  set forth in Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:     

Revolving Credit Maturity Date  shall mean the earlier of (i) January 31, 2017 and (ii) the date on which the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment shall terminate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  

2. 
			 This Amendment shall become effective (according to the terms hereof) on the date (the  Ninth Amendment Effective Date ) that the following conditions have been fully satisfied by Borrower:     

(a) 

Agent shall have received counterpart signature pages to this Amendment, duly executed and delivered by each of Agent, Borrower and Lenders;

Borrower shall have paid to Agent all reasonable costs and expenses, if any, that are due and owing to Agent and Lenders as of the date hereof;     

(c)  Agent and Lenders shall have received such other documents and completion of matters as Agent or Lenders may deem necessary or appropriate.  

3. 
			 Borrower hereby represents and warrants that, after giving effect to this Amendment, (a) the execution and delivery of this Amendment are within such party s corporate

The Site Plan depicts the office complex (the    Complex   ), of which the Building forms a part, located on the land (the    Land   ) that is legally described on   Exhibit A-2   attached hereto.  The parties hereby acknowledge that the purpose of   Exhibit A-1   is to show the approximate location of the Premises in the Complex (as defined below) and such Exhibit is not meant to constitute an agreement, representation or warranty as to the construction of the Premises, the precise area thereof or the specific location of the Common Areas (as that term is defined in   Paragraph 6  ), or the elements thereof or of the access ways to the Premises or the Complex.  As used in this Lease, the term    Complex    or the    Property    means the Premises, a second building comprising 116,000 square feet of space (the    Other Building    and, together with the Building, the    Buildings   ), surface parking areas (collectively, the "  Parking Area  " or    Parking Areas   ), and certain other improvements on the Land that are or may be reasonably designated from time to time by Landlord as Common Areas appurtenant to or servicing the Buildings, and all other improvements, fixtures and equipment now or hereafter situated on the Land.  This Lease is made upon and subject to the terms, covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, and Tenant covenants as a material part of the consideration for this Lease to perform and observe each and all of such terms, covenants and conditions.

Tenant shall comply with all recorded covenants, conditions, and restrictions currently affecting the Complex.  Additionally, Tenant acknowledges that the Complex may be subject to any future covenants, conditions, and restrictions (the "  CC Rs  ") which Landlord, in Landlord s reasonable discretion, deems necessary or desirable, and Tenant agrees that this Lease shall be subject and subordinate to such CC  provided, however, that from and after the Effective Date Landlord will not attempt to make the Premises or Complex subject to any new CC Rs or modifications of existing CC Rs which would unreasonably impair Tenant s ability to use or have access to the Premises or the      

1 

associated parking areas or which would unreasonably diminish Tenant s rights hereunder (other than in a de minimus manner) or materially increase Tenant s costs hereunder without the prior written consent of Tenant.  Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to execute (or make good faith and reasonable corrective comments to) and acknowledge, within fifteen (15) business days of a request by Landlord, an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant agreeing to and acknowledging the CC Rs.  Tenant shall not do or permit to be done in or about the Premises or the Complex nor bring or keep or permit to be brought or kept in or about the Premises or the Complex anything that is prohibited by or will in any way increase the existing rate of (or otherwise adversely affect) any fire insurance or other insurance covering the Complex or any part thereof, or any of its contents, or will cause a cancellation of any insurance covering the Complex or any part thereof, or any of its contents.  Tenant shall not do or permit to be done anything in, on or about the Premises or the Complex that will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Complex or injure them, or use or allow the Premises to be used for any unlawful purpose, nor shall Tenant cause, maintain or permit any nuisance in, on or about the Premises or the Complex.  No sale by auction shall be permitted on the Premises.

Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold Landlord and its Mortgagees, officers, partners, members, shareholders, trustees, parent companies, directors, employees, representatives, successors and assigns (each, an    Indemnified Party    and collectively, the    Indemnified Parties   ) harmless from and against all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses, disbursements, demands and claims, including attorneys  fees and costs incurred as a result of such claims or in enforcing this indemnification provision (collectively,    Claims   ), arising out of any failure of Tenant or any person controlled by Tenant to comply with any applicable Law relating to the Premises or Tenant s use thereof or for which Tenant is otherwise obligated to comply under the terms of this Lease.  The provisions of this   Paragraph 2   are for the benefit of Landlord and the other Indemnified Parties only and shall not be construed to be for the benefit of any other tenant or occupant of the Complex other than Tenant.  Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that the Premises has not undergone inspection by a Certified Access Specialist (CASp).        

3. 
			       TERM  . As used herein, (i) the term    Delivery Date    will be the date that the Premises are delivered by Landlord to Tenant, free and clear of the current tenant s occupancy (such delivery being referred to as    Delivery   ), (ii) the term    Construction Period    shall mean the three (3) month period after the Delivery Date, and (iii) the    Commencement Date    shall be the later of (a) January 1, 2017 (the    Anticipated Delivery Date   ) or (b) seven (7) days after the Delivery Date.  For purposes of this   Paragraph 3   and   Paragraph 5  ,    Delivery    shall be deemed to have occurred if Landlord offers to tender possession of the Premises to Tenant in the condition required by the preceding clause (i) but Tenant fails to provide the evidence of insurance and insurance endorsements required by the terms of this Lease.  The term of this Lease (the    Term   ) shall commence as of the Commencement Date and shall end on the last day of the month falling one hundred twenty nine (129) full months after the Commencement Date (the    Expiration Date   ).  By way of example, if the Delivery Date (and hence the Commencement Date)      

2 

occurs on the Anticipated Delivery Date, then the Expiration Date will be September 30, 2027, and if the Delivery Date occurs on January 10, 2017 (i.e., after the Anticipated Delivery Date), then the Expiration Date shall be October 31, 2027.  During the Construction Period, Tenant and Tenant s representatives, vendors, employees and contractors shall have the right to enter the Premises for the purposes of installing and constructing the Tenant Improvements pursuant to the provisions of the Tenant Work Letter and of installing Tenant s personal property and equipment, furniture, fixtures, voice and data cabling, as well as occupying the Premises for the conduct of Tenant s business operations prior to the Commencement Date, all subject to the terms, conditions and requirements of this Lease other than the obligation to pay Base Rent (hereinafter defined) or the Direct Expenses (hereinafter defined).  Tenant agrees that if for any reason Landlord is unable to achieve Delivery on or before the Anticipated Delivery Date, Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease and Landlord shall not be liable for any damage resulting from such inability, but except to the extent such delay is the result of the acts or omissions of Tenant, the Commencement Date, the Rent Commencement Date (as defined in   Paragraph 5(a)  ) and the Additional Rent Commencement Date (as defined in   Paragraph 5(h)  ) shall be delayed beyond the Target Rent Commencement Date and the Target Additional Rent Commencement Date (each as hereafter defined) on a day-for-day basis for each day of such delay in Delivery.  At any time after the Commencement Date, Landlord shall have the right to submit to Tenant an amendment to this Lease in the form of   Exhibit B   to this Lease (the    Amendment   ) confirming the Commencement Date, the Expiration Date, the Rent Commencement Date, the Base Rent Schedule and such other terms as may reasonably be provided in such amendment, and Tenant shall execute (or make good faith and reasonable corrective comments to) and deliver the Amendment to Landlord within ten (10) business days after Tenant s receipt thereof.  If Tenant fails to execute (or make good faith and reasonable corrective comments to) and return the Amendment within such ten (10) business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved and confirmed the dates set forth therein, provided that such deemed approval shall not relieve Tenant of its obligation to execute and return the Amendment.      

4. 
			      SECURITY DEPOSIT  .  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Lease, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord a security deposit in an amount equal to two (2) months of the Base Rent payable during the last month of the Term (i.e., Three Hundred Eighty-Seven Thousand Forty-Seven and 92/100 Dollars ($387,047.92)) (the    Security Deposit   ).  Landlord shall hold the Security Deposit as security for the faithful performance by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by Tenant during the Term hereof.  If Tenant defaults with respect to any provision of this Lease, including, but not limited to, the provisions relating to the payment of Rent and any of the monetary sums due herewith, Landlord may (but shall not be required to) use, apply or retain all or any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of any other amount which Landlord may spend by reason of Tenant s default or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant s default.  If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used or applied, within ten (10) business days after Landlord s written demand therefor, Tenant shall deposit cash with Landlord in the amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount.  Tenant s failure to do so shall be a material breach of this Lease.  Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds, and Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on the Security Deposit.  If Tenant fully and faithfully performs every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, the Security Deposit or any balance thereof shall be returned to Tenant (or at Landlord s option, to the last assignee of tenant s interest hereunder) within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Term and after Tenant has vacated the Premises and has satisfied all conditions to the return of such funds, including without limitation the performance of Tenant s surrender and other obligations under this Lease.  In the event of termination of Landlord s interest in this Lease, Landlord shall transfer the Security Deposit to Landlord s successor in interest, whereupon Tenant shall be deemed to have released Landlord from all liability for the return of such Deposit or the accounting therefor.  Nothing in this   Paragraph 4   shall be construed to limit the amount of damages recoverable by Landlord or any other remedy to the amount of the Security Deposit.  Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code, and all      

3 

other provisions of any Laws, now or hereinafter in force, to the extent the same restricts the amount or types of claim that a landlord may make upon a security deposit or imposes upon a landlord (or its successors) any obligation with respect to the handling or return of security deposits.  Landlord and Tenant agree that Landlord may, in addition, claim those sums reasonably necessary to compensate Landlord for any foreseeable or unforeseeable loss or damage caused by the act or omission of Tenant.  Tenant may not assign or encumber the Security Deposit, and any attempt to do so shall be void and, in all events, not binding upon Landlord.      

(a) 
			 Base Rent  .  From and after the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay, without notice or demand, to Landlord, or at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing at least ten (10) business days before the effective date of the change in the Rent payment address, in cash or other immediately available good funds, base rent (   Base Rent   ), payable in monthly installments as set forth in the Base Rent Schedule set forth below, in advance on or before the first (1  st  ) day of each and every month during the Term, without any setoff or deduction whatsoever except as expressly set forth herein.  As used in this Lease, the term    Rent Commencement Date    means the date that is nine (9) months after the Commencement Date.  The Rent Commencement Date is anticipated to be October 1, 2017 (the    Target Rent Commencement Date   ), provided that if the Delivery Date occurs after the Anticipated Delivery Date, then for each day after the Anticipated Delivery Date that elapses until the actual Delivery Date occurs, the Rent Commencement Date shall be extended by the same number of days.  The period of time elapsing between the Commencement Date and the Rent Commencement Date is referred to as the    Base     Rent Abatement Period  .   Base Rent shall increase by three (3%) on the first day of the first full calendar month that is twelve (12) months after the Commencement Date (the    First Adjustment Date   ) and on each subsequent anniversary of the First Adjustment Date (each, an    Adjustment Date   ), as set forth in the Base Rent Schedule set forth below.  The First Adjustment Date is anticipated to occur on January 1, 2018.

BASE RENT SCHEDULE 

*The abatement of Base Rent during the Base Rent Abatement Period is subject to   Paragraph 5(h)   below. 

(b) 
			 Additional Rent and Rent Defined  .  As used herein, the term    Additional Rent    means Operating Expenses (as defined below), Management Fees (as defined in   Paragraph 5(f)  ), and   all other amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to the terms of this Lease other than Base Rent.       Rent    or    rent    means Base Rent and Additional Rent.  In the event of nonpayment by Tenant of Operating Expenses or other Additional Rent, Landlord shall have all the rights and remedies with respect thereto as Landlord has for nonpayment of Base Rent.  During the Construction Period, in addition to not being obligated to pay Base Rent, Tenant shall not be obligated to pay Operating Expenses, Real Property      

5 

Taxes or the Management Fee (the    Additional Rent Abatement   ); the Additional Rent Abatement will expire as of the expiration of the Construction Period.  The date on which Tenant is required to commence paying Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes and the Management Fee (i.e., the day following the date of expiration of the Construction Period) is referred to as the    Additional Rent Commencement Date  .   The Additional Rent Commencement Date is anticipated to be April 1, 2017 (the    Target Additional Rent Commencement Date   ), provided that if the Delivery Date occurs after the Anticipated Delivery Date, then for each day after the Anticipated Delivery Date that elapses until the actual Delivery Date occurs, the Additional Rent Commencement Date shall be extended by the same number of days.     

(c) 
			 Time for Payment  .  Starting on the first day of the first month after the Additional Rent Commencement Date and/or the Rent Commencement Date, as applicable, monthly Rent (which will not include Base Rent until the Rent Commencement Date) shall be due in advance on the first day of each such calendar month.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence to the contrary, the full monthly payment of Base Rent and estimated Operating Expenses for the first full month of the Term after the Base Rent Abatement Period (the    Prepaid     Rent   ) shall be due and payable concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Lease.  Accordingly, concurrently with the full execution and delivery of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Prepaid Rent the sum of One Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty-Five and 20/100 Dollars ($168,755.20).  The Rent for any fractional month shall be a proportionate amount of a full calendar month s Rent based on the proportion that the number of days in such fractional month bears to the number of days in the calendar month during which such fractional month occurs.  All other payments or adjustments required to be made under the terms of this Lease that require proration on a time basis shall be prorated on the same basis.     

(d) 
			 Late Charge  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, i  f any installment of Rent or any other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or Landlord's designee by the due date therefor, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount due plus any reasonable attorneys  fees incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's failure to pay Rent and/or other charges when due hereunder; notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled to a notice of non-payment and a five (5) day cure period prior to the imposition of such late charge on the first (1st) occasion during the first five (5) years of the Term or any subsequent five (5) year period of the Term or any extension thereof in which any installment of Rent is not timely paid.  The late charge shall be deemed Additional Rent and the right to require it shall be in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies hereunder, at law and/or in equity, and shall not be construed as liquidated damages or as limiting Landlord's remedies in any manner.  In addition to the late charge described above, any Rent or other amounts owing hereunder which are not paid by the date that they are due shall thereafter bear interest until paid at a rate (the "  Interest Rate  ") equal to the lesser of (i) the "Prime Rate" or "Reference Rate" announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. (or such reasonable comparable national banking institution as selected by Landlord in the event Bank of America, N.A. ceases to exist or publish a Prime Rate or Reference Rate), plus four percent (4%), or (ii) the highest rate permitted by applicable Law.     

(e) 
			 Operating Expenses  .  This Lease is a triple net lease, and Base Rent shall be paid to Landlord absolutely net of all costs and expenses relating to the Building and Tenant s Proportionate Share (defined below) of the Complex, except as specifically provided to the contrary in this Lease.  As used in this Lease, Tenant s    Proportionate Share    of Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes and other Direct Expenses (as defined below in this   Paragraph 5(e)  ) or other amounts payable by Tenant shall be deemed to be thirty-six percent (36%), provided that with respect to any Operating Expenses that are allocable solely to the Building (and not to the Other Building) Tenant s Proportionate Share shall be one hundred percent (100%).  Similarly, with respect to Operating Expenses that are allocable solely to the Other Building (or any collection of buildings now or hereafter located at the Complex but not the      

6 

Building), Tenant s Proportionate Share will be zero percent (0%).  The parties hereby agree that the Premises contain 64,000 rentable square feet, there shall be no adjustment in the Base Rent or other amounts set forth in this Lease that are determined based upon rentable or usable square feet of the Premises, and Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease or receive any adjustment or rebate of any Base Rent or Additional Rent payable hereunder if the square footage of the Complex or the Premises is incorrect.  However, if the rentable area of the Complex is changed by the construction of new rentable area on the Land (other than with regard to increases to the rentable area of the Building as the result of the Lobby Changes, if any, made by Tenant pursuant to   Section 5.7   of the Tenant Work Letter), Tenant s Proportionate Share shall be adjusted accordingly.  Beginning on the first (1st) day immediately following the expiration of the Additional Rent Abatement Period, Tenant shall pay to Landlord or to Landlord s designated agent, in addition to the Base Rent and as Additional Rent, the following (collectively,    Direct Expenses   ):     

(i) 
			 Tenant s Proportionate Share of all Real Property Taxes for the Complex as set forth in   Paragraph 14  , and     

(ii) 
			 Tenant s Proportionate Share of insurance premiums and deductibles relating to the Complex and Premises, as set forth in   Paragraph 18  , and     

(iii) 
			 Tenant s Proportionate Share of other Operating Expenses required to be paid under   Paragraph 8,   and     

(iv) 
			 All charges, costs and expenses that Tenant is required to pay hereunder other than Base Rent, together with all interest and penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and legal expenses), that may accrue thereto in the event of Tenant s failure to pay such amounts, and all damages, reasonable costs and expenses that Landlord may incur by reason of default of Tenant or failure on Tenant s part to comply with the terms of this Lease.     

Tenant shall pay to Landlord monthly, in advance, Tenant s Proportionate Share of the amount estimated by Landlord (as described below) to be Landlord s approximate average monthly expenditure for such Direct Expenses.    Landlord shall endeavor to give Tenant, on or before July 1 each year during the Term, a yearly expense estimate statement (the    Estimate Statement   ), which shall set forth Landlord's reasonable estimate (the    Estimate   ) of what the total amount of the Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes and Management Fee charges allocated to the Building shall be and the estimated amount of Tenant's Proportionate Share of such amounts (the    Estimated   Expense Payments   ) for the upcoming fiscal year.    Landlord's Estimate Statement for any fiscal year shall be set forth in reasonable detail, and shall contain a line-item breakdown of component costs and the method of calculation of any categories of Direct Expenses which represents an equitable proration by Landlord between the Building and the Other Building (or any other building subsequently constructed in the Complex) as set forth below.    As used in this Lease, the term    fiscal year    shall mean July 1 to June 30 of each year during the Term of the Lease.    Landlord shall have the right to update the Estimate Statement and Estimated Expense Payments from time to time, in which event Tenant thereafter shall pay the revised Estimated Expense Payments set forth in such updated Estimate Statement commencing as of the first (1st) day and the first (1st) calendar month which occurs at least thirty (30) days after Landlord s delivery to Tenant of notice of such revision.  The failure of Landlord to timely furnish an Estimate Statement for any fiscal year shall not preclude Landlord from enforcing its rights to collect any Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes or other amounts payable by Tenant hereunder.  Upon delivery of the Estimate Statement, Tenant shall pay, with its next installment of Base Rent due at least thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the Estimate Statement, a fraction of the Estimated   Expense Payments   for the then-current fiscal year (reduced by any amounts paid pursuant to the last sentence of this paragraph).  Such fraction shall have as its numerator the number of months which have elapsed in such current fiscal year to the   

7 

month of such payment, both months inclusive, and shall have twelve (12) as its denominator.  Until a new Estimate Statement is furnished, Tenant shall pay monthly, with the monthly Base Rent installments, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the total Estimated   Expense Payments   set forth in the previous Estimate Statement delivered by Landlord to Tenant. 

Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently if Landlord elects to do so, at Landlord s sole and absolute discretion, the Estimate Expense Payments shall be reconciled with Landlord s actual expenditure for such Additional Rent items and set forth in a reasonably detailed statement (the    Statement   ). 

Landlord has provided Tenant with an example of, and Tenant has approved, the form of Estimate Statement/ Statement currently used by Landlord, a copy of which is attached to this Lease as   Exhibit J-1   (the    Sample Statement   ).  Tenant acknowledges that the amounts specified in the Sample Statement are estimates only and do not constitute a representation or warranty by Landlord of what actual Direct Expenses are or will be during the Term.  If Landlord hereafter makes any material changes to the form of the Sample Statement, any future Estimate Statement and Statement shall contain, to the extent applicable, the following: 

(A)  a line-item breakdown showing at least the following major categories of costs: 

(i) 
			 maintenance and repairs (including landscape maintenance, parking lot sweeping, fountain cleaning, and parking lot lighting maintenance);     

(i) 
			 utilities (electricity, water, sewer, and backflow prevention, maintenance and repairs);     

(i) 
			 insurance;     

(i) 
			 salaries (engineering and administrative);     

(i) 
			 general and administrative (Management Fees; professional services; office supplies; and other); and     

(i) 
			 Real Property Taxes;     

(B)  the anticipated savings to be realized in the subject calendar year by any Permitted Capital Item (defined below), the cost of which is included as a portion of Operating Expenses because such Capital Item was intended to reduce other Operating Expenses; 

(C)  to the extent that the Direct Expenses include wages, salaries and payroll burdens that are not included in the Management Fee, the method of prorating the wages, salaries and payroll burden of employees engaged primarily, but not solely, in the management, operation or maintenance of the Building or portions of the Complex benefitting the Building versus taxes which primarily or solely benefit the Other Building or any other building(s) now or hereafter located on the Complex; and 

(D)  an explanation in reasonable detail of any other proportionate cost attributable to the Building which represents a proration of costs shared by one or more buildings. 

Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the applicable Statement, the amount of actual Direct Expenses expended by Landlord in excess of the Estimated Expense Payments, or if the Estimated Expense Payments actually paid by Tenant exceeds Tenant s Proportionate Share of the   

8 

actual amounts of Direct Expenses paid by Landlord, Landlord shall reimburse or credit to Tenant (provided Tenant is not in Default) any amount of Estimated Expense Payments made by Tenant in excess of Tenant s Proportionate Share of Landlord s actual expenditures for such Additional Rent items. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at Landlord s Option, Landlord shall have the right to separately charge and collect in a lump sum from Tenant any Real Property Taxes and insurance premiums by delivering to Tenant an invoice setting forth the applicable Real Property Taxes and insurance premiums that are due.  In such event, Tenant shall pay Landlord Tenant s Proportionate Share of such expenses within thirty (30) days (or, in the case of insurance premiums, within fifteen (15) days) after Landlord s delivery of the applicable invoice to Tenant.  Tenant acknowledges that to the extent Landlord has prepaid any Operating Expenses (such as insurance premiums) or Real Property Taxes for the Premises or the Complex prior to the Additional Rent Commencement Date that relate to Operating Expenses that are payable by Tenant following the Additional Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for its Proportionate Share of such expenses as set forth in this   Paragraph 5(e)  . 

(f) 
			 Fixed Management Fee  .  Beginning on the Additional Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in addition to the Base Rent and as part of the Additional Rent, a fixed monthly management fee (   Management Fee   ) equal to three percent (3%) per month of all Base Rent and Direct Expenses.     

(g) 
			 Place of Payment of Rent  .  All Rent hereunder shall be paid to Landlord at the office of Landlord at: SP Zanker Property, LLC, c/o Sahadi Properties, L.P. 800 Pollard Road, C-36, Los Gatos, California 95032, or to such other person or to such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the address change.     

(h) 
			 Abated Rent  .  Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that Tenant shall not be obligated to pay Base Rent attributable to the Premises during the Base Rent Abatement Period (the "  Base Rent Abatement  ") and that the aggregate amount of the Base Rent Abatement equals One Million Two Hundred Ninety-Six Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($1,296,000.00).  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that during the Base Rent Abatement Period, such abatement of Base Rent for the Premises shall have no effect on the calculation of any future increases in Base Rent or Operating Expenses payable by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, which increases shall be calculated without regard to such Base Rent Abatement.  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing Base Rent Abatement has been granted to Tenant as additional consideration for entering into this Lease, and for agreeing to pay the Rent and perform the terms and conditions otherwise required under this Lease.  If Tenant shall be in Default hereunder, and if Landlord terminates this Lease as a consequence of such Default, then Landlord may include in its calculation of termination damages the then (as of the date of the Default) unamortized portion of the Base Rent Abatement, assuming amortization of the Abated Rent (without interest) on a straight line basis over the Term.     

(i) 
			 Landlord s Records  .  Landlord shall maintain during the Term complete and accurate books of account and records in accordance with sound real estate management and accounting practices as are reasonably necessary to properly audit Direct Expenses.  Upon Tenant s written request given not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after Tenant s receipt of a Statement for a particular fiscal year, and provided that Tenant is not then in Default, specifically including, but not limited to, the timely payment of Additional Rent (whether or not a component thereof is the subject of the audit contemplated herein), Landlord shall furnish Tenant with such reasonable supporting documentation pertaining to the calculation of the Direct Expenses payable by Tenant as set forth in the Statement as Tenant may reasonably request.  Landlord shall provide said documentation pertaining to the relevant      

9 

Direct Expenses to Tenant within sixty (60) days after Tenant s written request therefor.  Within sixty (60) days after Landlord s delivery of all of such supporting documentation (the "  Audit Period  "), if Tenant disputes the amount of the Direct Expenses payable by Tenant set forth in the Statement, after reasonable notice to Landlord and at reasonable times, Tenant may retain an independent certified public accountant to conduct an audit at Landlord s office of Landlord s records with respect to the Direct Expenses payable by Tenant set forth in the Statement, provided that (i) Tenant is not then in Default, (ii) Tenant has paid all amounts required to be paid under the applicable Estimate Statement and Statement, and (iii) a copy of the audit agreement between Tenant and its particular certified public accounting firm has been delivered to Landlord prior to the commencement of the audit.  Any such accountant shall (A) be a member of a nationally or regionally recognized certified public accounting firm which has previous experience in auditing financial operating records of landlords of office buildings, (B) not already be providing primary accounting and/or lease administration services to Tenant and shall not have provided primary accounting and/or lease administration services to Tenant in the past three (3) years, (C) not be working on a contingency fee basis [i.e., Tenant must be billed based on the actual time and materials that are incurred by the certified public accounting firm in the performance of the audit], and (D) not currently be providing accounting and/or lease administration services to another tenant of the Complex in connection with a review or audit by such other tenant of similar expense records).  In connection with such audit, Tenant and Tenant s certified public accounting firm must execute a commercially reasonable confidentiality agreement regarding such audit.  Any audit report prepared by Tenant s certified public accounting firm shall be delivered concurrently to Landlord and Tenant within the Audit Period.  Tenant s failure to audit the amount of the Direct Expenses payable by Tenant set forth in any Statement within the Audit Period shall be deemed to be Tenant s approval of such Statement and Tenant, thereafter, waives the right or ability to audit the amounts set forth in such Statement.  If after such audit, Tenant still disputes the Direct Expenses payable by Tenant, an audit to determine the proper amount shall be made, at Tenant s expense, by an independent certified public accountant (the "  Accountant  ") selected by Landlord and subject to Tenant s reasonable approval.  Tenant hereby acknowledges that Tenant s sole right to audit Landlord s records and to contest the amount of Direct Expenses payable by Tenant shall be as set forth in this   Paragraph 5(i)  , and Tenant hereby waives any and all other rights pursuant to applicable law to audit such records and/or to contest the amount of Direct Expenses payable by Tenant.  If Landlord's Statement is ultimately determined to be in error, within thirty (30) days after such determination, Landlord will reimburse to Tenant, or Tenant will pay to Landlord, any amount which may be determined to have been due as a result of the Accountant s audit; additionally, if Landlord is determined to have overcharged Tenant for Direct Expenses by five percent (5%) or more, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant within thirty (30) days following such determination for the reasonable cost of the Accountant (which cost may not be included as a Direct Expense).     

(j)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant will not be responsible for any Direct Expenses attributable to any fiscal year which is first billed to Tenant more than thirty (30) months after the date of expiration of the expiration of the fiscal year to which such Direct Expenses apply, provided that Tenant shall nonetheless be responsible for any such sums for any fiscal year if the same are first levied by any governmental authority or by any public utility companies following the date that is thirty (30) months following the expiration of such fiscal year.

It shall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any Alteration which affects the Building Structure or Systems and Equipment or is visible from the exterior of the Building.  The   construction of the Tenant Improvements shall be governed by the terms of the Tenant Work Letter and not the terms of this   Paragraph 11  .

Landlord s response shall be in writing and, if Landlord withholds its consent, Landlord shall specify in reasonable detail in Landlord s notice of disapproval, the basis for such disapproval, and the changes to Tenant s plans which would be required in order to obtain Landlord s approval.  If Landlord fails to notify Tenant of Landlord s approval or disapproval within such ten (10) business day period, Tenant shall have the right to provide Landlord with a second written request for approval (a    Second Request   ) that contains the following statement in bold and capital letters:     THIS IS A SECOND REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF PLANS PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPHS 11(a) AND 11(b) OF THE LEASE.  IF LANDLORD FAILS TO RESPOND WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THIS NOTICE, THEN LANDLORD SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE APPROVED THE ALTERATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN  .   If Landlord fails to respond to such Second Request within five (5) business days after receipt by Landlord, the Alterations in question shall be deemed approved by Landlord.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the time period for Landlord s response would fall between December 20 and January 2 (the    Blackout Period   ), then for each such day falling during the Blackout Period, the time period for Landlord to respond to any request for Alteration shall be extended on a day-for-day basis.    If Landlord timely delivers to Tenant notice of Landlord s disapproval of any plans, Tenant may revise Tenant s plans to incorporate the changes suggested by Landlord in Landlord s notice of disapproval, and resubmit such plans to Landlord; in such event, the scope of Landlord s review of such plans shall be limited to Tenant s correction of the items in which Landlord had previously objected in writing.  Landlord s review and approval (or deemed approval) of such revised plans shall be governed by the provisions set forth above in this   Paragraph 11(a)  ).

Landlord may impose, as a condition of its consent to any and all Alterations or material repairs of the Premises which involve the Building Structure or material work on the Systems and Equipment or that affect the exterior appearance of the Building (a    Major Alteration   ), such requirements as Landlord in its reasonable discretion, commensurate with the provisions of owners of Comparable Buildings (as defined in   Section 31(d)  ), may deem desirable, including, but not limited to, the requirement that Tenant utilize for such purposes only contractors, subcontractors, materials, mechanics and materialmen selected by Tenant and approved by Landlord (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), and the requirement that upon Landlord's request delivered concurrently with Landlord s consent to any Specialty Alterations that Tenant, at Tenant's expense, remove such Specialty Alterations upon the expiration or any early termination of the Term.  As      

18 

used herein, a    Specialty Alteration    shall mean any Alteration that is not a normal and customary general office improvement or that materially deviates from the Surrender Plans, including, but not limited to improvements which (i) perforate, penetrate or require reinforcement of a floor slab (including, without limitation, interior stairwells or high-density filing or racking systems), (ii) consist of the installation of a raised flooring system, (iii) consist of the installation of a vault or other similar device or system intended to secure the Premises or a portion thereof in a manner that exceeds the level of security necessary for ordinary office space, (iv) involve material plumbing connections (such as, for example but not by way of limitation, kitchens, saunas, showers, and executive bathrooms outside of the Building core and/or special fire safety systems), (v) consist of the dedication of any material portion of the Premises to non-office usage (such as laboratories, classrooms, bicycle storage rooms, or  cooking  kitchens), (vi) can be seen from outside the Premises, or (vii) are required to be removed under   Paragraph 9(b)   or the Surrender Plans (or the Detailed Surrender Plans, as applicable).  As a condition to Landlord s obligation to consider any request for consent to any Alterations, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord within thirty (30) days after Tenant s receipt of invoices and reasonable supporting documentation for the reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses of consultants, engineers, architects and others for reasonable review of plans and specifications for the construction of the proposed Alterations.  Tenant shall construct such Alterations and perform such repairs in conformance with any and all applicable rules and regulations of any federal, state, county or municipal code or ordinance and pursuant to a valid building permit, issued by the City, and in conformance with Landlord s construction rules and regulations; provided, however, that prior to commencing to construct any Alteration, Tenant shall meet with Landlord to discuss Landlord's design parameters and code compliance issues.  In performing the work of any such Alterations, Tenant shall have the work performed in such manner so as not to obstruct access to the Complex or any portion thereof, by any other tenant of the Complex, and so as not to obstruct the business of Landlord or other tenants in the Complex.  Tenant shall not use (and upon notice from Landlord shall cease using) contractors, services, workmen, labor, materials or equipment that, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, would disturb labor harmony with the workforce or trades engaged in performing other work, labor or services in or about the Complex.  In addition to Tenant's obligations under   Paragraph 22   of this Lease, upon completion of any Alterations, Tenant agrees to cause a Notice of Completion to be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which the Building is located in accordance with Section 8182 of the Civil Code of the State of California or any successor statute, and Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a reproducible copy of the "as built" drawings of the Alterations as well as all permits, approvals and other documents issued by any governmental agency in connection with the Alterations.  At the conclusion of construction, Tenant shall (i) cause its architect to update the drawings as necessary to reflect all changes made to the Alterations Constructions Drawings during the course of construction, and (ii) deliver to Landlord two (2) sets of sepias of such as-built drawings as well as CAD and pdf copies of same, and (ii) deliver to Landlord a copy of all warranties, guaranties, and operating manuals and information relating to the improvements, equipment, and systems relating to such Alterations.     

(c) 
			 Payment for Alterations  .  Tenant shall obtain final lien releases and waivers in a form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord in connection with Tenant's payment for work to contractors, subcontractors and materialmen.  Tenant shall pay for all overhead, general conditions, fees and other costs and expenses of the Alterations, and shall pay to Landlord a Landlord supervision fee of three percent (3%) of the cost of the Alterations.     

(d) 
			 Construction Insurance  .  In addition to the requirements of   Paragraph 17   of this Lease, in the event that Tenant makes any Alterations, prior to the commencement of such Alterations, Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence that Tenant or Tenant s general contractor carries "builder's all risk" or  course of construction  insurance in an amount reasonably approved by Landlord covering the construction of such Alterations, and that Tenant and the general contractor carry general liability, worker s compensation, and such other insurance as Landlord may reasonably require, it being      

19 

understood and agreed that all of such Alterations shall be insured by Tenant pursuant to   Paragraph 17   of this Lease immediately upon completion thereof.  In addition, if the estimated costs of the Alterations exceeds One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) Landlord may, in its discretion, require Tenant to obtain at Landlord s option a lien and completion bond or some alternate form of security reasonably satisfactory to Landlord in an amount sufficient to ensure the lien-free completion of such Alterations.     

(e) 
			 Removal of Alterations; Landlord's Property  .  All Alterations that may be installed in the Premises, from time to time, shall be made at the sole cost of Tenant.  During the final six (6) month of the Term, Landlord and Tenant will endeavor to meet and confer to determine which, if any, of the Specialty Alterations previously made by Tenant which Landlord continues to desire that Tenant surrender with the Premises upon expiration of the Term.  If Landlord agrees in writing that any such Specialty Alterations may remain at and be surrendered with the Premises upon expiration of the Term or upon prior termination of this Lease, the same shall become a part of the Premises and the property of Landlord upon expiration of the Term or upon prior termination of this Lease.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the parties fails to meet prior to the expiration of the Term, or if Landlord does not agree to permit any Specialty Alterations to remain and be surrendered with the Premises, Tenant s obligations with respect to such Specialty Alterations shall be governed by   Paragraph 9(b)  .  If Tenant fails to complete such removal and/or to repair any damage caused by the removal of any Specialty Alterations and return the affected portion of the Premises to the condition required hereunder, (i) Landlord may do so and may charge the cost thereof to Tenant, or (ii) Tenant shall be obligated to do so and will be deemed to be holding over until such time as the removal and restoration is completed (and, accordingly, the terms of   Paragraph 32   of this Lease shall be applicable during such period).  Tenant hereby protects, defends, indemnifies and holds Landlord harmless from all liens and other Claims in any manner relating to the installation, placement, removal, or financing of any such Alterations, improvements, fixtures and/or equipment in, on or about the Premises except to the extent the same arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord s agents, employees or contractors, which obligations of Tenant shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.     

(a) 
			 At its sole cost and expense, Tenant shall keep and maintain and repair the Premises (including appurtenances) and every part thereof in a high standard of maintenance and repair, or replacement, and in good and sanitary condition.  Tenant s maintenance and repair responsibilities herein referred to include, but are not limited to, providing janitorial service, cleaning, repair and replacement, as necessary, of all windows (interior and exterior), window frames, plate glass and glazing (destroyed by accident or act of third parties), truck doors, plumbing systems (such as water and drain lines, sinks, toilets, faucets, drains, showers and water fountains), electrical systems (such as panels, conduits, outlets, lighting fixtures, lamps, bulbs, tubes and ballasts), HVAC systems and components thereof (such as compressors, fans, air handlers, VAV boxes, ducts, mixing boxes, thermostats, time clocks, boilers, heaters, supply and return grills), and other Systems and Equipment (as defined below), electrical wiring and conduits, gas lines, water pipes, sprinkler, alarm and other life safety systems, and plumbing and sewage fixtures and pipes (both within the Building and outside the Building up to the point where any such pipe connects to the sewer main), foundations, slabs, structural elements and exterior surfaces of the Premises, roofs, downspouts, all interior improvements within the Premises including but not limited to wall coverings, window coverings, carpet, floor coverings, partitioning, ceilings, doors (both interior and exterior), including closing mechanisms, latches, locks, any exterior ramps and railings at the entrances of the Building, skylights (if any), automatic fire extinguishing systems, security systems, alarm systems, and elevators and all other interior improvements of any nature whatsoever.  As used herein, the term    Systems and Equipment    means any   plant, machinery, transformers, duct work, cable, wires, and other equipment, facilities, and systems designed to supply      

20 

heat, ventilation, air conditioning and humidity or any other services or utilities, or comprising or serving as any component or portion of the electrical, gas, steam, plumbing, sprinkler, communications, alarm, security, or fire/life safety systems or equipment, or any other mechanical, electrical, electronic, computer or other systems or equipment which serve the Building and/or any other building in the Complex in whole or in part.     

Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, if any Systems or Equipment (or major component thereof) or major component of the Building Structure requires replacement during the Term, including any replacement required by Law (and provided such replacement is not necessitated by (w) casualty or condemnation, (x) Tenant s failure to perform reasonable periodic maintenance and customary and reasonable repairs of such item, (y) Tenant s misuse of such item, or (z) the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or any Tenant Party, it being agreed that Tenant shall be solely responsible for any repairs or replacements necessitated by the preceding clauses (x), (y), and (z)), Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate in good faith to determine the best suitable replacement for such item (or component); in connection therewith, the parties will attempt to identify a substantially similar replacement item, and neither party shall have the right to require that the capacity, quality or size of such item be upgraded as a part of such replacement, unless the party requiring such upgrade agrees to bear any increased cost associated with the acquisition of an upgraded item compared to the acquisition of a reasonably similar substitute item (however, if applicable law requires an upgrade, the parties will share the cost of such upgrade as described herein).  Upon determining a mutually agreeable replacement item, the parties shall share the cost of such replacement (other than any increased cost associated with an upgrade, as described above), as follows:  (i) Tenant shall bear the first One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) of the cost of the replacement, (ii) Landlord shall initially bear the cost of such replacement in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) but, from and after the date of such replacement, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as and when Base Rent is payable hereunder, an amount equal to 1/120 of the applicable replacement cost which was so initially borne by Landlord (it being the intention of the parties hereto that any such item or unit will be assumed to have a useful life of approximately ten (10) years, and that the foregoing formula allocates to Tenant a proportionate share of the cost of such replacement equal to the relationship between the then-remaining Term and the useful life of the unit (or component) in question).  The amortized cost of such expenditure may include interest at the rate paid by Landlord on any funds borrowed (or, if Landlord elects to fund such expenditure using its own funds, at the market rate of interest, as reasonably determined by Landlord that Landlord reasonably would have paid had Landlord elected to finance such expenditure) from an unaffiliated third-party financial institution, but in no event greater than the Interest Rate. 

(b) 
			 Without limiting the foregoing, at its sole cost and expense Tenant shall enter into a contract or contracts (each a    Service Contract   ) in form and substance reasonably approved by Landlord with qualified, experienced professional third party service companies reasonably approved by Landlord to perform its maintenance, repair and replacement of these portions of the Systems and Equipment which require regularly scheduled periodic maintenance, including the HVAC systems (which shall provide for and include, without limitation, replacement of filters, oiling and lubricating of machinery, parts replacement, adjustment of drive belts, oil changes and other preventive maintenance, including annual maintenance of duct work, interior unit drains and caulking of sheet metal, and recaulking of jacks and vents on an annual basis), elevators, the roof, the building fire/life-safety systems, and the electrical and plumbing systems.  On an annual basis, Landlord shall have the right to review and approve each contractor or vendor retained by Tenant to perform scheduled maintenance and repairs and, if Landlord reasonably determines that such contractor or vendor is not performing adequate maintenance or repair, Landlord may require that Tenant replace such contractor or vendor with a contractor or vendor reasonably approved by Landlord.  The HVAC Service Contract shall provide for the HVAC service provider to maintain, repair and replace when necessary all HVAC equipment which serves the Premises and to keep the same in good condition through regular inspection and servicing at least once every sixty      

21 

(60) days.  Tenant also shall maintain continuously throughout the Term a Service Contract for the washing of all windows in the Premises (both interior and exterior surfaces) with a contractor approved by Landlord, which provides for the periodic washing of all such windows at least once every ninety (90) days and Service Contracts for the inspection, testing and servicing of the life-safety and elevator systems in the Premises, with a contractor reasonably approved by Landlord.  Upon Tenant s request, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with copies of all such Service Contracts.     

(c) 
			 All repairs and replacements required of Tenant shall be promptly made with new materials and equipment of like kind and quality, subject to the commercial availability of like kind materials.  If any maintenance, repairs, replacements or other work to be performed pursuant to this   Paragraph 12   affects the Building Structure or exterior of the Premises or if any non-scheduled material repair or replacement work relates to the Systems and Equipment, or if the estimated cost of any item of repair or replacement to the Building Structure or Systems and Equipment exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), then Tenant shall first obtain Landlord s written approval of the scope of work, plans therefor, materials to be used, and the contractor that will perform the work, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and to be governed by the provisions of   Paragraph 11(a)   above.  Tenant agrees to provide carpet shields under all rolling chairs.    Tenant shall employ only qualified, reputable and licensed contractors and vendors to perform maintenance  ,  repairs and   other services at the Premises.     

(d) 
			 Tenant shall regularly, in accordance with commercially reasonable standards, generate and maintain preventive maintenance records relating to the Systems and Equipment, including copies of all Service Contracts (   Books and Records   ).  In addition, within thirty (30) days following Landlord s written request, Tenant shall make available for Landlord s review (or at Tenant s option, deliver to Landlord copies of) the Books and Records.  Within thirty (30) days following Tenant s receipt of written request from Landlord, Tenant shall make available for Landlord s review (or at Tenant s option, deliver to Landlord copies of) any maintenance and repair reports, documents and back-up materials related to the maintenance, repair and other work required to be performed by Tenant, to the extent the same are regularly and customarily generated and maintained by, and in the possession of, Tenant or its management team (collectively, the    M R Reports   ).  Tenant s obligation to deliver Books and Records and M R Reports shall survive the Expiration Date and the prior termination of this Lease for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.     

(e) 
			 In the event any of the above maintenance responsibilities apply to any other tenant(s) of Landlord where there is common usage with other tenant(s), such maintenance responsibilities and charges shall be allocated to the Premises by square footage or other equitable basis as calculated and determined by Landlord.     

(a) 
			 Upon commencement of the Term, Tenant shall have all utilities servicing the Premises transferred into Tenant s name; Landlord will reasonably cooperate with Tenant s efforts to do so.  Tenant shall pay promptly, as the same become due, all charges for water, gas, electricity, telephone, broad band, internet, and other electronic communication service, sewer service, waste pick-up and any other utilities, materials or services furnished directly to or used by Tenant on or about the Premises during the Term, including, without limitation, any temporary or permanent utility surcharge or other exactions whether or not hereinafter imposed.  In the event the above charges apply to any other tenant(s) of Landlord where there is common usage with other tenant(s), such charges shall be allocated to the Premises by square footage or other equitable basis as calculated and determined by Landlord.     

22 

(b) 
			 In the event any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Land or the Building promulgates or revises any Law or building, fire or other code or imposes mandatory controls or guidelines on Landlord or the Land or the Building relating to the use or conservation of energy or utilities or the reduction of automobile or other emissions (collectively,    Controls   ) or in the event Landlord is required to make alterations to the Land or the Building in order to comply with such mandatory Controls, Landlord may, in its sole discretion, comply with such Controls or make such alterations to the Land or the Building related thereto but will us commercially reasonable efforts to carry out any such work in a manner calculated to minimize disturbance to Tenant s business operations therein as described in   Paragraph 25   below.  Such compliance and the making of such alterations shall not constitute an eviction of Tenant, constructive or otherwise, or impose upon Landlord any liability whatsoever, including, but not limited to, liability for consequential damages or loss of business by Tenant.  Costs incurred by Landlord in connection with implementation of mandatory Controls shall be included in Operating Expenses, and will be amortized as if such costs are Permitted Capital Items.     

(c) 
			 Landlord shall not be liable for and Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of Rent by reason of any interruption or failure of utility services to the Premises, including without limitation any interruption or failure that is caused by accident, breakage, repair, strikes, lockouts, or other labor disturbances or labor disputes of any nature, or by any other cause, similar or dissimilar, beyond the reasonable control of Landlord.     

(a) 
			 Real Property Taxes  .  As Additional Rent and in accordance with   Paragraph 5(e)   of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, monthly in advance pursuant to an Estimate or as they become due pursuant to statements submitted by Landlord, Tenant s Proportionate Share (which shall be allocated to the Premises by square footage or other equitable basis, as calculated by Landlord) of all Real Property Taxes relating to the Complex accruing during the Term of this Lease.  The term    Real Property Taxes    shall also include supplemental taxes related to the period of the Term whenever levied, including such taxes that may be levied after the Term has expired.  The term    Real Property Taxes   , as used herein, shall mean (i) all taxes, assessments, levies and other charges of any kind or nature whatsoever, general and special, foreseen and unforeseen (including all installments of principal and interest required to pay any general or special assessments for public improvements and any increases in taxes resulting from reassessments caused by any change in ownership of the Premises) now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority or special district having the direct or indirect power to tax or levy assessments, which are levied or assessed against, or with respect to the value, occupancy or use of, all or any portion of the Complex (as now constructed or as may at any time hereafter be constructed, altered, or otherwise changed) or Landlord s interest therein; any improvements located within the Complex (regardless of ownership); the fixtures, equipment and other property of Landlord, real or personal, that are an integral part of and located in the Complex; or Parking Areas, public utilities, or energy within the Complex; (ii) all charges, levies or fees imposed by reason of environmental regulation or other governmental control of the Complex; (iii) assessments, taxes, fees, levies and charges may be imposed by governmental agencies for services such as fire protection, street, sidewalk and road maintenance, refuse removal and for other governmental services; (iv) governmental or private assessments or the Complex s contribution towards a governmental or private cost-sharing agreement for the purpose of augmenting or improving the quality of services and amenities normally provided by governmental agencies; (v) any assessment, tax, fee, levy, or charge allocable to or measured by the area of the Premises or the Rent payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any business or gross income tax or excise tax with respect to the receipt of such rent, or upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operating, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises, or any portion thereof; (vi) any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge, upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party, creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the      

23 

Premises; (vii) any increases in taxes arising under Proposition 13 adopted by the voters of the State of California in the June 1978 election; and (viii) all costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by Landlord in reasonably contesting any Real Property Tax and in negotiating with public authorities as to any Real Property Tax.  Any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees) incurred in attempting to protest, reduce or minimize Real Property Taxes shall be included in Real Property Taxes in the fiscal year such expenses are incurred.  Tax refunds shall be credited against Real Property Taxes and refunded to Tenant regardless of when received, based on the fiscal year to which the refund is applicable, provided that in no event shall the amount to be refunded to Tenant for any such fiscal year exceed the total amount paid by Tenant for such fiscal year.  If Real Property Taxes for any period during the Term or any extension thereof are increased after payment thereof for any reason, including, without limitation, error or reassessment by applicable governmental or municipal authorities, Tenant shall pay Landlord upon demand Tenant's proportionate of any such increased Real Property Taxes.  If any Real Property Tax can be paid by Landlord in installments, then, for the purpose of calculating Tenant's obligation to pay Real Property Taxes, any such Real Property Tax shall be deemed to be paid by Landlord in the maximum allocable number of installments, regardless of the manner in which Landlord actually pays such Real Property Taxes.     

(b) 
			 Alternative Real Property Taxes  .  If at any time during the Term of this Lease the taxation or assessment of the Complex prevailing as of the Commencement Date of this Lease shall be altered so that in lieu of or in addition to any Real Property Tax described above there shall be levied, assessed or imposed (whether by reason of a change in the method of taxation or assessment, creation of a new tax or charge, or any other cause) an alternate or additional tax or charge (i) on the value, use or occupancy of the Complex or Landlord s interest therein or (ii) on or measured by the gross receipts, income or rentals from the Complex, on Landlord s business of leasing the Complex, or computed in any manner with respect to the operation of the Complex, then any such tax or charge, however designated, shall be included within the meaning of the term    Real Property Taxes    for purposes of this Lease.  If any Real Property Tax is based upon property or rents unrelated to the Complex, then only that part of such Real Property Tax that is fairly allocable to the Complex shall be included within the meaning of the term    Real Property Taxes  .      

(c)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term    Real Property Taxes    shall not include (i) estate, inheritance, gift or franchise taxes of Landlord or the federal or state net income tax imposed on Landlord s income from all sources, (ii) penalties incurred as a result of Landlord's negligence, inability or unwillingness to make payments of, and/or to file any tax or informational returns with respect to, any Real Property Taxes, when due, or (iii) any taxes directly payable by Tenant or any other tenant in the Complex under the applicable provisions in their respective leases.     

(d) 
			 Pursuit of Claim for Reduction of Real Property Taxes  .

In the event that Landlord does not elect either item (i) or (ii), above, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Tax Notice, Tenant shall thereafter have the right to pursue such claims under item (iii), above.  If Landlord either agrees to pursue such claims or concurs in the decision to pursue such claims but elects to have them pursued by Tenant, the cost of such proceedings shall be paid by Landlord and included in Real Property Taxes in the year such expenses are paid.  If Tenant pursues such claims without obtaining Landlord's concurrence and such contest is successful, then the cost of such proceedings, but in no event more than the cumulative tax savings to Landlord achieved, shall be deducted from Operating Expenses payable by Tenant in the fiscal year such expenses are paid.       

24 

Tenant may deliver a Tax Notice prior to the issuance of the actual tax bill by the taxing authority or receipt by Tenant of a billing from Landlord.     

(e) 
			 Taxes on Tenant s Property  .     

(i) 
			 Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay ten (10) days before delinquency, taxes levied against any personal property or trade fixtures placed by Tenant in or about the Premises.  If any such taxes on Tenant s personal property or trade fixtures are levied against Landlord or Landlord s property or if the assessed value of the Premises is increased by the inclusion therein of a value placed upon such personal property or trade fixtures of Tenant and if Landlord, after written notice to Tenant, pays the taxes based on such increased assessment, which Landlord shall have the right to do regardless of the validity thereof, but only under proper protest if requested by Tenant, Tenant shall within thirty (30) days following demand, as the case may be, repay to Landlord the taxes so levied against Landlord, or the proportion of such taxes resulting from such increase in the assessment; provided that in any such event Tenant shall have the right, in the name of Landlord and with Landlord s full cooperation, to bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of such taxes so paid under protest, and any amount so recovered shall belong to Tenant.     

(ii) 
			 If any improvements in the Premises, whether installed, and/or paid for by Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, are assessed for real property tax purposes at a valuation materially higher than the valuation at which standard office improvements in other space in the Complex are assessed, then the real property taxes and assessments levied against the Landlord or the Complex by reason of such excess assessed valuation shall be deemed to be taxes levied against personal property of the Tenant and shall be governed by the provisions of   Paragraph 14(d)(i)   above.  If the records of the County Assessor are available and sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for determining whether such Tenant improvements are assessed at a higher valuation than standard office space improvements in other space in the Complex, such records shall be binding on both the Landlord and the Tenant.  If the records of the County Assessor are not available or sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for making such determination, the actual cost of construction shall be used.     

15. 
			     CABLING AND LINES  . Tenant may install, maintain, replace, remove or use any communications or computer wires and cables (collectively, the "  Lines  ") at the Complex in or serving the Premises, provided that (i) Tenant shall obtain Landlord s prior written consent, use Landlord s designated contractor for provision of cabling and riser management services (or, if Landlord does not have a designated contractor, then an experienced and qualified contractor reasonably approved in writing by Landlord), and comply with all of the other provisions of   Paragraph 11   of this Lease, (ii) an acceptable number of spare Lines and space for additional Lines shall be maintained for existing and future occupants of the Complex, as determined in Landlord s reasonable opinion, (iii) the Lines therefor (including riser cables) shall be (x) appropriately insulated to prevent excessive electromagnetic fields or radiation, (y) surrounded by a protective conduit reasonably acceptable to Landlord, and (z) identified in accordance with the "Identification Requirements," as that term is defined below, (iv) any new or existing Lines servicing the Premises shall comply with all applicable Laws, (v) as a condition to permitting the installation of new Lines, Tenant shall remove the existing Lines located in or serving the Premises which are being replaced by the new Lines and repair any damage in connection with such removal, and (vi) Tenant shall pay all costs in connection therewith.  All Lines shall be clearly marked with adhesive plastic labels (or plastic tags attached to such Lines with wire) to show Tenant s name, suite number, telephone number and the name of the person to contact in the case of an emergency (A) every four feet (4 ) outside the Premises (specifically including, but not limited to, the electrical room risers and other Common Areas), and (B) at the Lines  termination point(s) (collectively, the "  Identification Requirements  ").  Upon the expiration of the Term, or immediately following any earlier termination of      

25 

this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant s sole cost and expense, remove all Lines installed by Tenant, and repair any damage caused by such removal.  In the event that Tenant fails to complete such removal and/or fails to repair any damage caused by the removal of any Lines, Landlord may do so and may charge the cost thereof to Tenant.  Landlord reserves the right to require that Tenant remove any Lines located in or serving the Premises which are installed in violation of these provisions, or which are at any time (1) are in violation of any Applicable Laws, (2) are inconsistent with then-existing industry standards (such as the standards promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association (e.g., such organization s "2002 National Electrical Code")), or (3) otherwise represent a dangerous or potentially dangerous condition.      

(a) 
			 Generally  .  The obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall be separate and independent covenants.  All covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under any of the terms of this Lease shall be performed by Tenant at Tenant s sole cost and expense and without any abatement of Rent, except as expressly set forth herein.  If Tenant shall fail to pay any sum of money, other than Base Rent, required to be paid by Tenant hereunder or shall fail to perform any other act on Tenant s part to be performed hereunder, including Tenant s obligations under   Paragraph 12   hereof, and such failure shall continue for fifteen (15) days after notice thereof by Landlord, in addition to the other rights and remedies of Landlord, Landlord may make any such payment and perform any such act on Tenant s part.  In the case of an emergency, no prior notification by Landlord shall be required.  Landlord may take such actions without any obligation and without releasing Tenant from any of Tenant s obligations.  All sums so paid by Landlord and all incidental costs incurred by Landlord and interest thereon at the Interest Rate, from the date of payment by Landlord, shall be paid to Landlord on demand as Additional Rent.  Tenant hereby waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Laws, any rights that it may now or in the future have to quit or surrender the Premises, to terminate this Lease, or to any abatement, except as expressly set forth herein, diminution, offset, reduction or suspension of Rent on account of any event or circumstance, including, without limitation, any rights it might otherwise have under the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1932 and 1933, or any amended, similar or successor laws.     

(b) 
			 Abatement Events  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of   Paragraph 16(a)   above, in the event that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or any portion thereof, as a result of (i) any repair, maintenance or alteration performed by Landlord, or which Landlord failed to perform, which substantially interferes with Tenant s use of or ingress to or egress from the Complex, Building or Premises, (ii) any interruption of services to all or any portion of the Premises if such failure is attributable to the sole active negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord (or Landlord s agents, employees or contractors) or to Landlord s failure to perform its maintenance obligations set forth herein, or (iii) the presence of Hazardous Materials that reasonably could be expected to pose a risk to health or human safety and that are caused by the acts of Landlord or Landlord s agents, employees or contractors, then Tenant shall have the right to give Landlord notice (the    Initial Notice   ), specifying such failure to perform by Landlord (the    Abatement Event   ).

If Landlord has not cured such Abatement Event within five (5) business days after the receipt of the Initial Notice, Tenant may deliver an additional notice to Landlord (the "  Additional Notice  "), specifying such Abatement Event and Tenant s intention to abate the payment of Rent under this Lease.  The Additional Notice shall identify this Lease and state in bold conspicuous font the following:     IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED.        THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL NOTICE UNDER SECTION 16(b) OF THE LEASE.  YOUR FAILURE TO CURE THE ABATEMENT

At Tenant's expense, Tenant shall comply as to the Premises with all insurance company requirements pertaining to the use of the Premises promulgated by Landlord s insurer of which Tenant has received written notice.  If Tenant's conduct or use of the Premises causes any increase in the premium for such insurance policies, then Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any such increase.

If Tenant receives notice from the insurer of any cancellation or material change in coverage, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice thereof promptly after receipt, in which event Landlord may require that Tenant procure replacement insurance from another carrier.  If Tenant shall fail to procure or to maintain any insurance required by this   Paragraph 17  , or to deliver such policies or certificate, within such time periods, Landlord may, at its option, in addition to all of its other rights and remedies under this Lease, and without regard to any notice and cure periods set forth in this Lease, procure such policies for the account of Tenant, and the cost thereof shall be paid to Landlord as Additional Rent within thirty (30) days after delivery of bills therefor.     

(c) 
			 Further Insurance Obligations  .  Tenant shall carry and maintain during the entire Term, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, increased amounts of the insurance required to be carried by Tenant pursuant to this   Paragraph 17  , and such other reasonable types of insurance coverage and in such reasonable amounts covering the Premises and Tenant's operations therein, as may be reasonably required by Landlord s Mortgagee or reasonably requested by Landlord, provided, however, (i) that such increased or other types of insurance are reasonably commensurate with the levels and types of coverage reasonably required by Landlord, including as the result of Tenant s particular use of the Premises and (ii) in no event shall Tenant be required to adjust its insurance coverage pursuant to the provisions of this   Paragraph 17(c)   more often than once in any twenty four (24) month period unless such adjustment is the result of Tenant s particular use of the Premises.

All such insurance shall (a) name Landlord as an additional insured under such party s liability policies as required by   Paragraphs 17(b)(vi)   and   17(b)(vii)   above and this   Paragraph 17(e)  , (b) provide a waiver of subrogation in favor of Landlord under such Third Party Contractor s commercial general liability insurance, (c) be primary and any insurance carried by Landlord or such Third Party Contractor shall be excess and non-contributing, and (d) comply with Landlord s reasonably minimum insurance requirements.     

(f) 
			 Self-Insurance of Certain Risks  .  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this   Paragraph 17   to the contrary,  so long as (i) the originally named Tenant or an Affiliate is the tenant-in-possession, and (ii) the Tenant meets the conditions set forth in this   Paragraph 17(f)  , Tenant may elect, on written notice to Landlord, to self-insure the risks covered by the insurance required by   clause (c)   of   Paragraph 17(b)(ii)   (i.e., earthquake insurance) and   clause (d) of Paragraph 17(b)(ii)   (i.e., terrorism insurance) that it is otherwise obligated to maintain under the terms of this Lease, subject to the following requirements:     

(i) 
			 "  Self-insure  " shall mean that Tenant is itself acting as though it were the insurance company providing the insurance required under the provisions hereof rather than placing insurance with a third-party insurer and shall pay any amounts due in lieu of insurance proceeds which would have been payable if the insurance policies had been carried, which amounts shall be treated as insurance proceeds for all purposes under this Lease.     

(ii) 
			 All amounts which are paid or are required to be paid and all loss or damages resulting from risks for which Tenant has elected to self-insure shall be subject to the waiver of subrogation provisions of   Paragraph 19   and shall not limit Tenant's indemnification obligations set forth in   Paragraph 20  .     

(iii) 
			 Tenant's right to self-insure and to continue to self-insure is conditioned upon and Tenant maintaining appropriate loss reserves.     

(iv) 
			 If an event or claim occurs for which coverage would have been available from the insurance company, Tenant shall use its own funds to pay any claim or replace any property or otherwise provide the funding which would have been available from insurance proceeds but for such election by Tenant to self-insure.     

18. 
			     PROPERTY AND LANDLORD S LIABILITY INSURANCE  . Landlord shall purchase and keep in force a policy of policies of insurance covering loss or damage to the Premises and the Complex (excluding routine maintenance and repairs and incidental damage or destruction caused by accidents or vandalism for which Tenant is responsible under   Paragraph 12  ), providing protection against those perils included within the classification of  special form  or  all risk  insurance and containing such endorsements as Landlord s Mortgagee may require, including coverage for boiler and machinery insurance.  Landlord will also obtain, if commercially available,  ordinance or law coverage  or  enforcement  endorsements, and a policy of rental loss insurance in the amount of one hundred (100%) percent of eighteen (18) months Base Rent (or such longer period of time after such eighteen-month period as may be required by Landlord s Mortgagee or as Landlord reasonably may require), plus sums paid as Additional Rent and any deductibles related thereto, and may elect to obtain flood (including both primary and excess flood), earthquake and/or terrorism insurance.  If the cost of any such insurance is increased solely due to Tenant s unique use of the Premises or the Complex, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord the full cost of such increase; similarly, if another Complex occupant s unique use causes the      

30 

cost of Landlord s insurance to be increased solely due to such use, Operating Expenses will not include the cost of any such increase, which will instead be borne by such occupant.  Tenant shall have no interest in nor any right to the proceeds of any insurance procured by Landlord for the Complex.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord (or Landlord s agent if so directed by Landlord) Tenant s Proportionate Share of the costs of all premiums and all deductibles on insurance claims, subject to the provisions of   Paragraph 8   above.  In addition to the above, during the Term, Landlord shall have the right to maintain a policy or policies of worker s compensation and employer s liability, employee dishonesty, automobile, and commercial general liability insurance insuring Landlord and the Indemnified Parties against liability for personal injury, bodily injury, death, and damage to property occurring or resulting from an occurrence in, on or about the Common Areas, with such limits as Landlord may determine to be reasonable or as are required to be maintained by Landlord s Mortgagee.  Any liability coverage required hereunder may be satisfied through a combination of primary and blanket or umbrella policies.  All costs and expenses of procuring the insurance described in this   Paragraph 18   shall constitute Operating Expenses under   Paragraph 5(e)  .       

19. 
			     WAIVER OF CERTAIN CLAIMS  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord and Tenant each hereby waives any and all rights of recovery, claim, action, or cause of action against the other, its agents, employees, licensees, or invitees for any loss or damage to or at the Premises or the Complex or any personal property of such party therein or thereon by reason of fire, the elements, or any other cause which would be insured against under the terms of (i) special causes of loss form property insurance or (ii) the liability insurance referred to in   Paragraph 17(b)(i)   and   Paragraph 18  , to the extent of such insurance, regardless of cause or origin, including omission of the other party hereto, its agents, employees, licensees, or invitees.  Landlord and Tenant covenant that no insurer under any such policy shall hold any right of subrogation against either of such parties with respect thereto.  This waiver shall be ineffective against any insurer of Landlord or Tenant to the extent that such waiver is prohibited by the laws and insurance regulations of the State of California.  The parties hereto agree that any and all such insurance policies required to be carried by either shall be endorsed with a subrogation clause, substantially as follows:  "This insurance shall not be invalidated should the insured waive, in writing prior to a loss, any and all right of recovery against any party for loss occurring to the property described therein, " and shall provide that such party's insurer waives any right of recovery against the other party in connection with any such loss or damage.        Landlord and Tenant hereby represent and warrant that their respective "all risk" property insurance policies include a waiver of (i) subrogation by the insurers, and (ii) all rights based upon an assignment from its insured, against Landlord and/or any of the Landlord Parties or Tenant and/or any of the Tenant Parties (as the case may be) in connection with any property loss risk thereby insured against.  Tenant will cause all subtenants and licensees of the Premises claiming by, under, or through Tenant to execute and deliver to Landlord a waiver of claims similar to the waiver in this   Paragraph 19   and to obtain such waiver of subrogation rights endorsements and Landlord will similarly extend the provisions of this   Paragraph 19   to any such subtenants or licensees who so comply.  If either party hereto fails to maintain the waivers set forth in items (i) and (ii) above, the party not maintaining the requisite waivers shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless the other party for, from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, damages, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys  fees) arising out of, resulting from, or relating to, such failure.      

20. 
			     INDEMNIFICATION  . Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant, and Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord, for any injury to or death of any person or damage to or destruction of property in or about the Premises or the Complex by or from any cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, gas, fire, oil, electricity or leakage of any character from the roof, walls, basement or other portion of the Premises or the Complex, a slip and fall or other accident, any criminal or terrorist activities, and/or the passive negligence of Landlord and any Indemnified Parties but excluding, however, the willful misconduct and sole active negligence of Landlord, its agents, servants, employees, invitees and/or contractors.  Except as to injury to persons or damage to property to the extent arising from the      

31 

willful misconduct or the sole active negligence of Landlord, its agents, employees or contractors, and subject to the provisions of   Paragraph 19   above, Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Landlord and the other Indemnified Parties against any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees, in connection therewith, arising out of any injury to or death of any person or damage to or destruction of property occurring in, on or about the Premises, or any part thereof, from any cause whatsoever, accruing and/or occurring during the Term of this Lease.  Should Landlord be named as a defendant in any suit brought against Tenant in connection with or arising out of Tenant's occupancy of the Premises or use of the Common Areas, Tenant shall pay to Landlord its costs and expenses incurred in such suit, including without limitation, its actual professional fees such as reasonable appraisers', accountants' and attorneys' fees.  Subject to the provisions of   Paragraph 19   above, Landlord shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Tenant against any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees, in connection therewith, arising out of any injury to or death of any person or damage to or destruction of property occurring in, on or about the Premises or Complex, or any part thereof, to the extent the same arises from the willful misconduct or the sole active negligence of Landlord, its agents, servants, employees, invitees, or contractors.      

21. 
			     COMPLIANCE  . At its sole cost and expense, Tenant promptly shall comply with all Laws (including without limitation the ADA, all  path of travel  requirements, the Toxic Mold Protection Act of 2001 and all fire, life safety, seismic and building code requirements,) now or hereafter in effect; with the requirements of any board of fire underwriters or other similar body now or hereafter constituted; and with any direction or occupancy certificate issued pursuant to any applicable Law by any public officer with respect to the Premises or any portion of the Complex that Tenant is required to maintain or repair pursuant to this Lease; provided, however, that no such failure shall be deemed a breach of the provisions if Tenant, immediately upon notification, commences to remedy or rectify such failure.  However, Tenant, at Tenant's expense, may contest by appropriate proceedings in good faith the legality or applicability of any Law affecting the Premises, provided that (i) the Building or any part thereof will not be subject to being condemned or vacated by reason of non-compliance or otherwise by reason of such contest, (ii) no unsafe or hazardous condition remains unremedied as a result of such contest, (iii) such non-compliance or contest is not prohibited under any then-applicable Mortgage, (iv) such non compliance or contest shall not prevent Landlord from obtaining any and all permits and licenses then required by applicable Laws in connection with the operation of the Complex, and (v) such non compliance or contest shall not invalidate, violate or give rise to an insurance carrier s right to cancel any insurance policy carried by Landlord or Tenant.  Tenant shall not do anything or suffer anything to be done in or about the Premises or the Complex which will in any way conflict with any Law now in force or which may hereafter be enacted or promulgated, including, without limitation, any such governmental regulations related to disabled access.  During the Term, should the Premises or any part thereof, whether structural or non-structural in nature, require modifications, renovations or Alterations to become compliant with any applicable Laws (including without limitation ADA compliance), the cost of any such modifications, repairs or Alterations shall be at Tenant s sole cost and without reimbursement by Landlord.  The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any action against Tenant, whether Landlord be a party thereto or not, that Tenant has violated any such Law shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant.  At its sole cost and expense, Tenant shall comply with any and all requirements pertaining to the Premises, of any insurance organization or company, necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and public liability insurance covering requirements pertaining to the Premises.      

22. 
			     LIENS  .  Tenant has no authority or power to cause or permit any lien or encumbrance of any kind whatsoever, whether created by act of Tenant, operation of law or otherwise, to attach to or be placed upon the Premises or the Complex, and any and all liens and encumbrances created by Tenant shall attach to Tenant s interest only.  Landlord shall have the right at all times to post and keep posted on the Premises any notice which it deems necessary for protection from such liens.  Tenant shall keep the      

32 

Premises free from any liens arising out of any work performed, materials furnished or obligation incurred by Tenant.  Within ten (10) business days following notice to Tenant of the imposition of any such lien, Tenant at its sole cost shall cause the same to be released of record, either by bonding (pursuant to a bond acceptable to First American Title Company or such other title company as may have insured title or agreed to insure the Complex from mechanics  lien claims), payment or otherwise by having such lien released of record).  If Tenant shall not, within ten (10) business days after notice to Tenant of the imposition of such lien, cause the same to be released of record, Landlord shall have, in addition to all other remedies provided herein and by law, the right, without any duty to investigate the validity thereof, to cause the same to be released by such means as it shall deem proper, including payment of the claim giving rise to such lien.  All sums paid by Landlord for such purpose, and all expenses incurred by it in connection therewith, shall be payable to Landlord by Tenant on demand with interest from the date expanded by Landlord at the Interest Rate.  To the extent, if at all, that Landlord has agreed to reimburse Tenant for any sums of money pursuant to this Lease, Landlord s obligation to reimburse Tenant shall be conditioned upon the full payment of all amounts owing to any mechanics  lien claimants (including any and all general contractors, subcontractors, and material providers), receipt of unconditional final lien releases from such claimants, and the lapse of all applicable lien periods of such claimants.  Without limiting the foregoing, if required by the title insurance company insuring title to the Land in connection with a prospective sale or financing of the Land, Tenant shall execute and deliver to the title insurance company a mechanics  lien indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Tenant and the Title Company with respect to any mechanics  or suppliers  liens created as the result of work or materials furnished to the Premises contracted by or through Tenant.      

23. 
			      SUBLEASING, ASSIGNMENT AND OTHER TRANSFERS  .     

(a) 
			 Landlord s Consent Required  .  Tenant shall not assign this Lease or any interest therein, or sublet or license or permit the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof by or for the benefit of anyone other than Tenant, or in any other manner transfer all or any part of Tenant s interest under this Lease (each and all a    Transfer   ), without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent (subject to the other provisions of this   Paragraph 23  ) shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  The term Transfer, as used herein, includes the following:  (i) the transfer, voluntary or involuntary, either by a single transaction or in a series of transactions, of a controlling interest in Tenant (or, if Tenant is a trust, in the trustee of such trust) which will not include the normal transfer of shares of Tenant on a nationally recognized securities exchange, (ii) any dissolution, merger, consolidation or other reorganization of Tenant, and (iii) the sale, by a single transaction or series of transactions, within any one (1) year period of assets equaling or exceeding fifty percent (50%) (or, if Tenant is a trust, exceeding fifty percent (50%)) of the total value of Tenant s assets.  As used herein, the term    controlling interest    means (a) in the case of a partnership, limited liability company or other business entity, the ownership of partnership interests, membership interests or other indicia of ownership constituting more than fifty percent (50%) of the ownership interests in Tenant (provided that in the case of a limited partnership or manager controlled limited liability company, it also means the ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the ownership interests in the general partner or manager of Tenant), and (b) in the case of a corporation, the ownership and/or the right to vote stock constituting more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock of Tenant.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber this Lease or all or any part of Tenant s interest under this Lease.     

(b) 
			 Reasonable Consent  .  Prior to any proposed Transfer, Tenant shall submit in writing to Landlord, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the Transfer, (i) the name and legal composition of the proposed assignee, subtenant, user or other transferee (each a    Proposed Transferee   ); (ii) the nature of the business proposed to be carried on in the Premises; (iii) a current balance sheet, income statements for the last two years and such other reasonable financial and

other information concerning the Proposed Transferee as Landlord may within ten (10) business days after Tenant s delivery of such balance sheet and income statements request; and (iv) a copy of the proposed assignment, sublease or other agreement(s) governing the proposed Transfer (   Transfer Documents   ).  Within twenty (20) days after Landlord receives all such information satisfying the requirements above, it shall notify Tenant whether it approves or disapproves such Transfer or if it elects to proceed under   Paragraph 23(g)  , provided that if the Mortgagee s consent is required for the proposed Transfer and the Mortgagee has not responded to Landlord s request for such consent within such time period, such time period shall be extended for three (3) business days after the Mortgagee s response.  If Landlord fails to timely deliver to Tenant notice of Landlord s consent, or the withholding of consent, to a proposed Transfer, Tenant may send a second (2nd) notice to Landlord, which notice must contain the following inscription, in bold faced lettering:    SECOND NOTICE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 23 OF LEASE - - FAILURE TO TIMELY RESPOND WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS SHALL RESULT IN DEEMED APPROVAL OF AN ASSIGNMENT, SUBLEASE OR OTHER TRANSFER BY TENANT.     If Landlord fails to deliver notice of Landlord s consent to, or the withholding of Landlord s consent, to the proposed assignment, sublease or other Transfer within such five (5) business day period, then unless the Mortgagee s consent to the Transfer was required and not granted or deemed granted under the terms of the applicable loan documents, Landlord shall be deemed to have approved the Transfer in question.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the time period for Landlord s response would fall during the Blackout Period, then for each such day falling during the Blackout Period, the time period for Landlord to respond to any request for consent to a Transfer shall be extended on a day-for-day basis.  If Landlord at any time timely delivers notice to Tenant or Landlord s withholding of consent to a proposed assignment or sublease, Landlord shall specify in reasonable detail in such notice, the basis for such withholding of consent.  Tenant acknowledges and agrees that, among other circumstances for which Landlord could reasonably withhold consent to a proposed Transfer, it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold consent where (i) the Proposed Transferee does not intend itself to occupy the entire portion of the Premises assigned or sublet, (ii) Landlord reasonably disapproves of the Proposed Transferee s business operating ability or history, reputation or creditworthiness or the character of the business to be conducted by the Proposed Transferee at the Premises, (iii) at the time Tenant requests Landlord s consent Tenant is in Default or an uncured notice of Default has been issued to Tenant, (iv) the Mortgagee s consent to the Transfer is required and the Mortgagee will not consent to the Transfer, or (v) the Transfer would result in a violation of the terms and conditions of this Lease or any loan document securing or evidencing a loan secured by the Complex.  In no event may Tenant place any signs in or about the Premises or Building to market the Premises for assignment or sublease.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, if Tenant or any proposed Transferee claims that Landlord has unreasonably withheld or delayed its consent under this   Paragraph 23   or otherwise has breached or acted unreasonably under this   Paragraph 23  , their sole remedies shall be a declaratory judgment and an injunction for the relief sought without any monetary damages, and Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1995.310 of the California Civil Code, or any successor statute, and all other remedies, including, without limitation, any right at law or equity to terminate this Lease, on its own behalf and, to the extent permitted under all applicable laws, on behalf of the proposed Transferee.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord from any and all liability, losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and proceedings involving any third party or parties (including without limitation Tenant s proposed subtenant or assignee) who claim they were damaged by Landlord s wrongful withholding or conditioning of Landlord s consent.     

(c) 
			 Excess Consideration  .  If Landlord consents to the Transfer, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, as and when received by Tenant, fifty percent (50%) of any Bonus Rent (as hereinafter defined) paid by or on behalf of any transferee (the    Transferee   ) for or in connection with the Transfer.  The term    Bonus Rent  ,  as used herein, means any and all rent and other consideration, whether denominated rent or otherwise, payable by or on behalf of the Transferee under the terms of the Transfer or any collateral agreement in excess of the Base Rent and Additional Rent payable hereunder,      

34 

less the reasonable cost of any improvements installed by the Tenant, at its expense, in the Premises pursuant to the Transfer for the specific subtenant or assignee (and approved by Landlord) and reasonable leasing commissions and reasonable attorneys  fees actually paid by the Tenant in connection with the Transfer, without deduction for carrying costs due to vacancy or otherwise.  At Landlord s option, upon written notice to the Transferee, Landlord may require the Transferee to pay Landlord s portion of such Bonus Rent directly to Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord s acceptance or collection of the Bonus Rent will not be deemed to be a consent to any Transfer or a cure of any Default under this   Paragraph 23   or any other provisions of this Lease.  In the case of a sublease, the Bonus Rent shall be determined by comparing the rent and/or other consideration payable under the sublease to the portion of the Base Rent and Additional Rent allocable to the subleased portion of the Premises (and the portion of the Base Rent and Additional Rent allocable to the subleased portion of the Premises shall be determined by multiplying the Base Rent and Additional Rent by a fraction, the numerator of which is the rentable area of the subleased portion of the Premises and the denominator of which is the rentable area of the Premises).     

(d) 
			 No Release of Tenant  .  No Transfer shall relieve Tenant of any obligation to be performed by Tenant under this Lease, whether accruing before or after such Transfer.  The consent by Landlord to any Transfer shall not relieve Tenant or any Transferee from the obligation to obtain Landlord s express prior written consent to any subsequent Transfer by Tenant or any Transferee.  The acceptance of rent by Landlord from any other person (whether or not such person is an occupant of the Premises) shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease or to be Landlord s consent to any Transfer.     

(e) 
			 Expenses and Attorneys  Fees  .  Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by Landlord in connection with reviewing and responding to any proposed Transfer (including any request for consent to, or any waiver of Landlord s rights in connection with, any security interest in any of Tenant s property at the Premises).  Such expenses also shall include reasonable costs incurred by Landlord in considering any improvements or Alterations proposed to be made in connection with the Transfer.     

(f) 
			 Effectiveness of Transfer  .  Prior to the date on which any Transfer becomes effective, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a counterpart of the fully executed Transfer document and the final form of Consent to Assignment or Consent to Sublease executed by Tenant and the Transferee in which each of Tenant and the Transferee confirms its obligations pursuant to this Lease.  Failure or refusal of a Transferee to execute any such instrument shall not release or discharge the Transferee from any liability.  The voluntary, involuntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, or a mutual cancellation by Landlord and Tenant, shall not work a merger, and any such surrender or cancellation shall, at the option of Landlord, either terminate all or any existing subleases or operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or all of such subleases.     

(g) 
			 Landlord s Right to Recapture Space  .  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this   Paragraph 23   to the contrary, if Tenant notifies Landlord that it desires to enter into a Transfer of (x) all of the Premises (including without limitation an assignment of the Lease or a sublease of all of the Premises), (y) of any portion of the Premises consisting of more than twenty five percent (25%) of the Premises for a term which is all, or essentially all, of the then-remaining Term, or (z) more than one entire floor of the Premises for a term expiring on after the date that is twelve (12) months prior to the Expiration Date, except, in each case, with respect to a Permitted Transfer, Landlord shall have the right to recapture the entire portion of the Premises proposed to be Transferred, by giving Tenant written notice that Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, effective on the date specified in Landlord s notice, as to such portion of the Premises.  Landlord may lease the portion of the Premises so recaptured (the "  Recaptured Space  ") to any party, including Tenant s Proposed Transferee, on such terms as Landlord,      

35 

in its discretion, determines.  In the event of a partial termination of this Lease, Base Rent and Tenant s Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses and other Additional Rent shall be reduced proportionately to the reduction in the area of the Premises.     

(h) 
			 Assignment of Sublease Rents  .  Tenant hereby absolutely and irrevocably assigns to Landlord any and all rights to receive rent and other consideration from any sublease and agrees that Landlord, as assignee or as attorney-in-fact for Tenant for purposes hereof, or a receiver for Tenant appointed on Landlord s application may (but shall not be obligated to) collect such rents and other consideration and apply the same toward Tenant s obligations to Landlord under this Lease; provided, however, that Landlord grants to Tenant at all times prior to occurrence of any Default by Tenant a license to collect such rents (which license shall automatically and without notice be and be deemed to have been revoked and terminated immediately upon any Default).     

(i) 
			 Additional Requirements  .  Any Transfer shall be null and void unless it complies with this Lease and:  (i) in the case of an assignment, provides that the assignee assumes all of Tenant s obligations under this Lease and agrees to be bound by all of the terms of this Lease; and (ii) in the case of a sublease, provides that (a) it is subject and subordinate to this Lease, (b) if there is any conflict or inconsistency between the sublease and this Lease, as between the subtenant and Landlord or Tenant and Landlord, this Lease will prevail, (c)   [OMITTED]  , (d) the sublease may not be modified (but may be terminated) without Landlord s prior written consent and that any modification without such consent shall be null and void, (e) if this Lease is terminated or Landlord reenters or repossesses the Premises, Landlord may, at its option, take over all of Tenant s right, title and interest as sublessor and, at Landlord s option, the subtenant shall attorn to Landlord, but Landlord shall not be (x) liable for any previous act or omission of Tenant under the sublease, (y) subject to any existing defense or offset against Tenant, or (z) bound by any previous modification of the sublease made without Landlord s prior written consent or by any prepayment of more than one (1) month s rent.    Any and all sublease agreement(s) between Tenant and any and all subtenant(s) (which agreements must be consented to by Landlord pursuant to the requirements of this Lease) shall contain the following provision:   If Landlord and Tenant jointly and voluntarily elect, for any reason whatsoever, to terminate the Master Lease prior to the scheduled Master Lease termination date, then this Sublease (if then still in effect) shall terminate concurrently with the termination of the Master Lease.  Subtenant expressly acknowledges and agrees that (1) the voluntary termination of the Master Lease by Landlord and Tenant and the resulting termination of this Sublease shall not give Subtenant any right or power to make any legal or equitable claim against Landlord, including without limitation any claim for interference with contract or interference with prospective economic advantage, and (2) Subtenant hereby waives any and all rights it may have under law or at equity against Landlord to challenge such an early termination of the Sublease, and unconditionally releases and relieves Landlord, and its officers, directors, employees and agents, from any and all claims, demands, and/or causes of action whatsoever.      

(j) 
			 Administration and Enforcement  .  If a Transfer occurs, then subject to Landlord s rights set forth elsewhere in this   Paragraph 23  , Tenant shall (a) cause the assignee, subtenant, user or other transferee (the    Transferee   ) promptly and faithfully to   make all payments and perform all other acts required to be made or performed by the Transferee under the Transfer Documents and to   conform to and comply with the terms and conditions of the Transfer Documents required to be performed by the Transferee,   (b) not consent to any further assignment, sublease or transfer of the Transferee s rights and/or obligations under the Transfer Documents without the prior written consent of Landlord; (d) not   grant, permit or suffer to exist any lien, security interest or other encumbrance on the interest of Tenant or the Transferee in the Transfer Documents, or agree to do so, except in favor of Landlord; (c) not amend or modify the Transfer Documents without Landlord s prior written consent; (d) deliver to Landlord copies of all notices given by the Transferee or Tenant under the Transfer Documents;      

36 

and (e) promptly notify Landlord in writing of the occurrence of any default (i.e., beyond notice and the passage of any grace period) Tenant or the Transferee under the Transfer Documents.     

(k) 
			 Permitted Transfers  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Paragraph 23  , if Tenant is not in Default, Tenant may assign this Lease or sublet any portion of the Premises (hereinafter collectively referred to as a    Permitted Transfer   ) to (a) an    Affiliate    of Tenant (defined as an entity which is Controlled by, Controls, or is under common Control with, Tenant), (b) any successor entity to Tenant by way of merger, consolidation or other non-bankruptcy corporate reorganization, or (c) an entity which acquires all or substantially all of Tenant s assets (collectively,    Permitted Transferees   , and, individually, a    Permitted Transferee   ); provided that (i) at least ten (10) days before the Transfer, Tenant notifies Landlord of such Transfer, and supplies Landlord with any documents or information reasonably requested by Landlord regarding such Transfer or Permitted Transferee, including, but not limited to, copies of the sublease or instrument of assignment and copies of documents establishing to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord that the transaction in question is one permitted under this   Paragraph 23(k)   (however, if the delivery of such notice is precluded by applicable Law or confidentiality agreement, Tenant will be required to provide such notice as soon as the provision of such notice is permissible), (ii) not less than ten (10) business days after the Transfer, Tenant furnishes Landlord with a written document executed by the Permitted Transferee in which such entity assumes all of Tenant s obligations under this Lease (in the case of a sublease, to the extent applicable), and (iii) any such proposed Transfer is made for a good faith operating business purpose and not, whether in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, be entered into as a subterfuge to evade the obligations and restrictions relating to Transfers set forth in this   Paragraph 23  .  For purposes of this   Paragraph 23(k)  ,    Control    shall mean the ownership, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, affairs and policies of anyone, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.  For the purpose of this   Paragraph 23  , if Tenant is a corporation or other entity whose capital stock is traded on a public exchange, the sale of Tenant's capital stock through any such public exchange shall not be deemed an assignment, subletting, or any other Transfer of the Lease or the Premises.  In addition,   Paragraph 23(c)   and   Paragraph 23(g)   shall not apply to a Permitted Transfer.     

24. 
			     ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES; SUBORDINATION; LENDER PROTECTIONS  .     

(a) 
			 Estoppel Certificates  .  Within ten (10) business days after written request therefor, Tenant shall execute (or make reasonable good faith corrective comments to) and deliver to Landlord, in the form of   Exhibit F   hereto or such other form of certificate as may be reasonably required by Landlord s current or potential Mortgagee, or, in the event of a sale of the Building, in a form reasonably required by any actual or potential purchaser of the Property.  The form of the current Mortgagee s estoppel certificate is attached as   Exhibit G  .  Any such certificate may include provisions stating that this Lease is in full force and effect, describing any amendments or modifications hereto, acknowledging that this Lease is subordinate or prior, as the case may be, to any encumbrance and stating any other information Landlord may reasonably request, including the Term, the date on which the Term began and expires, the monthly Base Rent, the date to which Rent has been paid, the amount of any security deposit or prepaid rent, whether either party hereto is in default under the terms of the Lease, and whether Landlord has completed its obligations, if any, to construct any improvements or to pay any improvement allowances.  Any person or entity purchasing, acquiring an interest in or extending financing with respect to the Property shall be entitled to rely upon any such certificate; provided, however, that no such certificate shall be deemed to modify or amend the express provisions of this Lease.  If Tenant fails to deliver such certificate within the time period set forth above and such failure continues for three (3) business days after delivery of notice of such failure, at Landlord s option, Tenant will be in Default hereunder.  Similarly, if Tenant is seeking financing, is engaged in a merger or acquisition transaction, or is proposing to engage in any sublease or assignment and if the party with which Tenant is negotiating requires an estoppel certificate from Landlord and Tenant is not in      

37 

Default, then within ten (10) business days after Landlord s receipt of Tenant s written request (provided that if such ten (10) business day period falls during the Blackout Period, then for each such day falling during the Blackout Period, the time period shall be extended on a day-for-day basis) Landlord agrees to deliver to Tenant a statement (upon which such third party may rely), confirming the Term, the date on which the Term began and expires, the monthly Base Rent, the date to which Rent has been paid, the amount of any security deposit or prepaid rent, whether either party hereto is in default under the terms of the Lease, and whether Landlord has completed its obligations, if any, to construct any improvements or to pay any improvement allowances.     

(b) 
			 Subordination  .  Subject to Tenant s receipt of an SNDA (defined below) as described herein, this Lease is expressly made subject and subordinate to any mortgage, deed of trust, ground lease, underlying lease or like encumbrance affecting any part of the Property or any interest of Landlord therein which is now existing or hereafter executed or recorded (   Encumbrance   ).  Tenant shall execute (or make good faith and reasonable corrective comments to) and deliver to Landlord, within ten (10) business days after written request therefor by Landlord and in a form reasonably requested by Landlord, any additional documents evidencing the subordination of this Lease as described herein.  If the interest of Landlord in the Property is transferred pursuant to or in lieu of proceedings for enforcement of any Encumbrance, provided the new owner requires Tenant to do so or Tenant is party to an SNDA as herein described, Tenant shall attorn to the new owner, and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between the transferee and Tenant on the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease.  Anything in this   Paragraph 24(b)   to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Mortgagee so elects in writing, this Lease shall be deemed superior to the Encumbrance held by the Mortgagee, regardless of the date of recordation of the Encumbrance, and Tenant will execute an agreement confirming the Mortgagee s election on request.     

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this   Paragraph 24(b)  , if not obtained prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Lease, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its existing Mortgagee (   Lender   ) within thirty (30) days after the full execution and delivery of this Lease a subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreement (the    SNDA   ).  A copy of the Lender s current form of SNDA with Tenant s requested changes is attached hereto as   Exhibit H  .  In the event that Tenant desires to modify or otherwise negotiate the form of the SNDA, Tenant shall be liable for all additional costs and expenses associated therewith.  In addition, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an SNDA from any future ground lessors or mortgagees in such ground lessor s or mortgagees standard form.  Except as set forth in the next-succeeding sentence, Tenant shall pay all costs incurred by Landlord in obtaining the SNDA or any other subordination and non-disturbance agreement.  "  Commercially reasonable efforts  " of Landlord shall not require Landlord to incur any cost or expense (other than the then-current lender s  base fee  for the issuance of a SNDA; for avoidance of doubt, Tenant shall be responsible for cost associated with the negotiation of any Tenant-requested modifications to any such SNDA) or liability to obtain such SNDA.  Landlord's failure to obtain the SNDA or any other non-disturbance, subordination and attornment agreement for Tenant in a form acceptable to Tenant shall have no effect on the rights, obligations and liabilities of Landlord and Tenant or be considered to be a default by Landlord hereunder; however, absent the delivery of a SNDA, Tenant shall have no obligation hereunder to subordinate this Lease to the lien of such Mortgagee s loan. 

(c) 
			 Mortgagee Protection  .  Tenant agrees to give any holder of any Encumbrance covering any part of the Property (   Mortgagee   ), by certified mail or nationally recognized overnight courier, a copy of any notice of default served by Tenant upon Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of notice of assignment of rents and leases, or otherwise) of the address of such Mortgagee.  If Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days from the effective date of such notice of default, then (provided the Mortgagee has      

38 

notified Tenant within such thirty (30) day period of the Mortgagee s intent to attempt to cure Landlord s default and thereafter diligently and continuously prosecute such cure) the Mortgagee shall have an additional thirty (30) days within which to cure such default or if such default cannot be cured within that time, then such additional time as may be necessary to cure such default (including the time necessary to foreclose or otherwise terminate its Encumbrance, if necessary to effect such cure), and this Lease shall not be terminated so long as such remedies are being diligently pursued; provided, however, that nothing contained in this   Paragraph 24(c)   shall be construed to impose any obligation on a Mortgagee to cure such default.     

(d) 
			 Attornment  .  In the event the interest of Landlord in the land and Building (whether such interest of Landlord is a fee title interest or a leasehold interest) is encumbered by deed of trust, and such interest is acquired by the Mortgagee or any third party through judicial foreclosure or by exercise of a power of sale at private trustee s foreclosure sale, and subject to the terms of any SNDA that has been entered into by Tenant and the Mortgagee as described above, Tenant hereby agrees to attorn to the purchaser at any such judicial foreclosure or foreclosure sale and to recognize such purchaser as the Landlord under this Lease.  In the event the lien of the deed of trust securing the loan from a Mortgagee to Landlord is prior and paramount to this Lease and subject to the terms of any SNDA previously executed by Tenant and the Mortgagee, at the Mortgagee s sole option (which option shall be elected, if at all, in writing by the Mortgagee), this Lease shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect for the remainder of the unexpired Term hereof, at the same rental herein reserved and upon all the other terms, conditions and covenants herein contained.     

(e) 
			 Financial Statements  .  If at any time during the Term, Tenant s financial reports (i.e., Forms 10-K and 10-Q) are not publicly available on the Securities Exchange Commission s website or otherwise, then, within ten (10) business days after written request therefor, but not more than once a year (unless required by an actual or prospective purchaser or Mortgagee), upon request by Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of the financial statements (including at least a year end balance sheet and a statement of profit and loss) of Tenant (and of each guarantor, if any, of Tenant s obligations under this Lease) for each of the three most recently completed years, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (and, if such is Tenant s normal practice, audited by an independent certified public accountant), together with all then available subsequent interim statements.     

(f) 
			 Modification of Lease  .  Should any current or prospective Mortgagee or ground lessor for the Building require a modification or modifications of this Lease, which modification or modifications will not cause an increased cost or expense to Tenant or in any other way adversely change the rights and obligations of Tenant hereunder (other than in a de minimus manner, such as adding the requirement that Tenant must provide additional notice to such ground lessor or Mortgagee of any Landlord default), then and in such event, Tenant agrees that this Lease may be so modified and agrees to execute or make good faith and reasonable corrective comments to whatever documents are required therefor and deliver the same to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the request therefor, provided that Landlord agrees to reimburse Tenant within thirty (30) days following the delivery of an invoice therefor, for the reasonable actual third party attorneys  fees and costs incurred in Tenant s review and negotiation of any such documents.  Should Landlord or any such current or prospective mortgagee or ground lessor require execution of a short form of Lease for recording, containing, among other customary provisions, the names of the parties, a description of the Premises and the Term, Tenant agrees to execute or make good faith and reasonable corrective comments to such short form of Lease and to deliver the same to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the request therefor.     

25. 
			     ENTRY BY LANDLORD  . Landlord reserves, and shall at all reasonable times after at least twenty four (24) hours  notice (except in emergencies, in which event no advance notice shall be required) have the right to enter the Premises (i) to inspect them; (ii) to perform any services which are      

39 

expressly to be provided by Landlord hereunder; (iii) to make necessary repairs in accordance with the express provisions of this Lease; (iv) to submit the Premises to prospective purchasers, Mortgagees or (during the final twelve (12) months of the Term only) tenants; (v) to post notices of non-responsibility; all without abatement of Rent (except as set forth in   Paragraph 16(b)  ), and may erect scaffolding and other necessary structures in or through the Premises where reasonably required by the character of the work to be performed; provided, however that the business of Tenant shall be interfered with to the least extent that is reasonably practical, Tenant shall have the right to require that Landlord be accompanied by a representative of Tenant during any such entry (other than during an emergency); and in connection therein, other than in the event of an emergency, Landlord and Tenant will reasonably cooperate to coordinate such entry.  Landlord shall use diligent efforts to ensure that any such entry (or any work in the Complex which might affect the Premises) will not interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises (or any portion thereof) for Tenant's business purposes (such efforts to include limiting the performance of any such work which might be disruptive to weekends or the evening and the cleaning of any work area prior to the commencement of the next business day).  To the extent that Landlord installs, maintains, uses, repairs or replaces pipes, cables, ductwork, conduits, utility lines, and/or wires through hung ceiling space, exterior perimeter walls and column space, adjacent to and in demising partitions and columns, in or beneath the floor slab or above, below, or through the Premises, then in the course of making any such installation or repair, Landlord will (w) not interfere unreasonably with or interrupt the business operations of Tenant within the Premises; (x) not reduce Tenant s usable space, except to a de minimus extent, if the same are not installed behind existing walls or ceilings; (y) box in any of the same installed adjacent to existing walls with construction materials substantially similar to those existing in the affected area(s) of the Premises; and (z) repair all damage caused by the same and restore such area(s) of the Premises to the condition existing immediately prior to such work.  Any entry to the Premises by Landlord for the purposes provided for herein shall not under any circumstances be construed or deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into or a detainer of the Premises or an eviction, actual or constructive, of Tenant from the Premises or any portion thereof.      

26. 
			       TENANT'S DEFAULTS; LANDLORD'S REMEDIES  .     

(a) 
			 Events of Default by Tenant  .  All covenants and agreements to be kept or performed by Tenant under this Lease shall be performed by Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense and without any reduction of Rent, except as expressly set forth herein.  The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a    Default    under this Lease by Tenant:     

(i) 
			 Any failure by Tenant to pay any Rent or any other charge required to be paid under this Lease or any part thereof as and when such amount is due; provided, however, that   Tenant shall be entitled to a notice of non-payment and a five (5) day cure period on the first (1st) occasion during the first thirty-six (36) months of the Term, and on the first (1st) occasion during each successive thirty-six (36) month period, in which any installment of Rent or other such charge is not timely paid, provided that on the second (2  nd  ) failure or any subsequent failure during any such thirty-six (36) month period, no such notice shall be required.     

(ii) 
			 Tenant abandons the Premises, as described in California Civil Code Section 1951.3.     

(iii) 
			 Tenant fails timely to deliver any subordination document, estoppel certificate, financial statement or other document requested by Landlord within the applicable time period specified in   Paragraph 24  .     

(iv) 
			 Tenant violates the restrictions on liens set forth in   Paragraph 22   or on Transfer set forth in   Paragraph 23  .     

40 

(v) 
			 Tenant ceases doing business as a going concern; makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; is adjudicated an insolvent, files a petition (or files an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition) seeking relief under any state or federal bankruptcy or other statute, law or regulation affecting creditors  rights; all or substantially all of Tenant s assets are subject to judicial seizure or attachment and are not released within thirty (30) days, or Tenant consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator for Tenant or for all or any substantial part of Tenant s assets.     

(vi) 
			 Tenant fails, within sixty (60) days after the commencement of any proceedings against Tenant seeking relief under any state or federal bankruptcy or other statute, law or regulation affecting creditors  rights, to have such proceedings dismissed, or Tenant fails, within six (30) days after an appointment, without Tenant s consent or acquiescence, of any trustee, receiver or liquidator for Tenant or for all or any substantial part of Tenant s assets, to have such appointment vacated.     

(vii) 
			 Tenant fails to deliver or replenish the Security Deposit as required under   Paragraph 4  .     

(viii) 
			 Tenant shall fail to observe or perform any other provision, covenant or condition of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant where such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Landlord to Tenant; provided, however, that any such notice shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any notice required under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161 or any similar or successor law; and provided further that if the nature of such default is such that the same cannot reasonably be cured within a thirty (30)-day period, Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default if it diligently commences such cure within such period and thereafter diligently proceeds to rectify and cure the default as soon as possible.     

(b) 
			 Landlord's Remedies  .  Upon the occurrence of any Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies, each and all of which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever.     

(i) 
			 Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so, Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim or damages therefor; and Landlord may recover from Tenant the following:     

(A) 
			 The worth at the time of award of any unpaid rent which has been earned at the time of such termination; plus     

(B) 
			 The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus     

(C) 
			 The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus     

(D) 
			 Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in      

41 

the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, specifically including but not limited to, brokerage commissions and advertising expenses incurred, expenses of remodeling the Premises or any portion thereof for a new tenant, whether for the same or a different use, and any special concessions made to obtain a new tenant; and     

(E) 
			 At Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable Law.     

The term  rent  as used in this   Paragraph 26(b)   shall be deemed to be and to mean all sums of every nature required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this Lease, whether to Landlord or to others.  As used in   Paragraph 26(b)(i)(A)   and   Paragraph 26(b)(i)(B)  ), above, the  worth at the time of award  shall be computed by allowing interest at the Interest Rate set forth in   Paragraph 5(d)   of this Lease.  As used in Paragraph   Paragraph 26(b)(i)(C)   above, the  worth at the time of award  shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%). 

(ii) 
			 Landlord shall have the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (lessor may continue lease in effect after lessee's breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due, if lessee has the right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations).  Accordingly, if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease on account of any Default by Tenant, Landlord may, from time to time, without terminating this Lease, enforce all of its rights and remedies under this Lease, including the right to recover all Rent as it becomes due.     

(iii) 
			 Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, make any such payment or perform or otherwise cure any such obligation, provision, covenant or condition on Tenant's part to be observed or performed regarding which Tenant is in Default hereunder (and may enter the Premises for such purposes).  In the event of Tenant's failure to perform any of its obligations or covenants under this Lease, and such failure to perform poses a material risk of injury or harm to persons or damage to or loss of property, then Landlord shall have the right to cure or otherwise perform such covenant or obligation at any time after such failure to perform by Tenant, whether or not any such notice or cure period set forth in   Paragraph 26(a)   above has expired.  Any such actions undertaken by Landlord pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Paragraph 26(b)(iii)   shall not be deemed a waiver of Landlord's rights and remedies as a result of Tenant's failure to perform and shall not release Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease.     

(c) 
			 Payment by Tenant  .  Tenant shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after delivery by Landlord to Tenant of statements therefor:  (i) sums equal to expenditures reasonably made and obligations incurred by Landlord in connection with Landlord's performance or cure of any of Tenant's obligations pursuant to the provisions of   Paragraph 26(b)(iii)   above; and (ii) sums equal to all expenditures made and obligations incurred by Landlord in collecting or attempting to collect any past-due Rent or other charges payable by Tenant hereunder, including, without limitation, all legal fees and other amounts so expended, plus interest on the amounts expended by Landlord at the Interest Rate.  Tenant's obligations under this   Paragraph 26(c)   shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of the Term.     

(d) 
			 Sublessees of Tenant  .  If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease on account of any Default by Tenant, as set forth in this   Paragraph 26  , Landlord shall have the right to terminate any and all subleases, licenses, concessions or other consensual arrangements for possession entered into by Tenant and affecting the Premises or may, in Landlord's sole discretion, succeed to Tenant's interest in such subleases, licenses, concessions or arrangements.

(e) 
			 Waiver of Default  .  No waiver by Landlord of any violation or breach by Tenant of any of the terms, provisions and covenants herein contained shall be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any other or later violation or breach by Tenant of the same or any other of the terms, provisions, and covenants herein contained.  Forbearance by Landlord in enforcement of one or more of the remedies herein provided upon a Default by Tenant shall not be deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of such Default.

(f) 
			 Efforts to Relet  .  For the purposes of this   Paragraph 26  , Tenant's right to possession shall not be deemed to have been terminated by efforts of Landlord to relet the Premises, by its acts of maintenance or preservation with respect to the Premises, or by appointment of a receiver to protect Landlord's interests hereunder.

27. 
			     ABANDONMENT  . Tenant shall not vacate or abandon the Premises at any time during the Term of this Lease and if Tenant shall abandon, vacate or surrender the Premises, or be dispossessed by the process of law, or otherwise, any personal property belonging to Tenant and left on the Premises shall be deemed to be abandoned, at the option of Landlord, except such property as may be mortgaged to Landlord.  However, Tenant shall not be in Default under this Lease if it leaves all or any part of Premises vacant so long as (i) Tenant is performing all of its other obligations under the Lease including the obligation to pay Rent (ii) Tenant provides on-site security during normal business hours for those parts of the Premises left vacant, (iii) such vacancy does not materially and adversely affect the validity or coverage of any policy of insurance carried by Landlord with respect to the Premises, and (iv) the utilities and Systems and Equipment (including the HVAC systems) are operated and maintained to the extent necessary to prevent damage to the Premises or its systems.

			     DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION  .     

(a) 
			   Repair of Damage to Premises by Landlord  .  Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of any damage to the Premises resulting from fire or any other casualty.  If the Premises or any Common Areas of the Building or the Real Property serving or providing access to the Premises shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Landlord will, within sixty (60) days following the date of the damage, deliver to Tenant an estimate of the time necessary to repair the damage in question such that the Premises may be used by and accessible to Tenant and the Building and Common Areas operable as a comparable office Complex; such notice will be based upon the review and opinions of Landlord s architect and contractor (   Landlord s Repair Notice   ).  Landlord shall promptly and diligently thereafter, subject to reasonable delays for insurance adjustment, delays occasioned by Landlord s Mortgagee, or other matters beyond Landlord s reasonable control, and subject to all other terms of this   Paragraph 28  , restore the Premises (other than improvements installed by Tenant and Tenant s Property), the   Systems and Equipment,   and the Common Areas.  Such restoration shall be to substantially the same condition of the Premises, the Systems and Equipment, and the Common Areas prior to the casualty, except for modifications required by zoning and building codes and other Laws or by any Mortgagee, or the lessor of a ground or underlying lease with respect to the Building and/or the Real Property, or any other modifications to the Common Areas reasonably deemed desirable by Landlord, subject to the provisions of   Paragraph 6   and   Paragraph 25   above.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, upon the occurrence of any damage to the Premises, at its sole cost and expense, Tenant      

43 

shall repair any injury or damage to the Tenant Improvements and Alterations installed in the Premises and shall return such Tenant Improvements and Alterations to their original condition or such alternate condition as Tenant, at the time, so desires, subject to receipt of Landlord s approval of any alternate design, such approval to be obtained in accordance with the provisions of   Paragraph 11   above.  Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or its visitors, or injury to Tenant s business resulting in any way from such damage or the repair thereof; provided however, that if such fire or other casualty shall have damaged the Premises or Common Areas necessary to Tenant s occupancy, Landlord shall allow Tenant a proportionate abatement of Rent, to the extent that Landlord is reimbursed from the proceeds of rental interruption insurance (provided that Landlord has maintained the rental loss coverage required by Article 18 above), during the time and to the extent the Premises are unfit for occupancy for the purposes permitted under this Lease, and not occupied by Tenant as a result thereof except for the maintenance of a  skeleton crew  within the affected portion of the Premises, for example, for such purposes as securing Tenant s records and files, forwarding telephone communications, correspondence and deliveries, and otherwise enabling those aspects of Tenant s business operations previously conducted within the affected portion of the Premises to be carried on from an alternative location.  However, if a substantial portion of the Premises is damaged to the extent that the remaining portion thereof is not sufficient to allow Tenant to conduct is business operations from such remaining portion and Tenant does not conduct its business operations therein, Tenant will be entitled to a total abatement of Rent, to the extent Landlord is reimbursed from the proceeds of rental interruption insurance (provided that Landlord has maintained the rental loss coverage required by Article 18 above), during the time and to the extent the Premises are unfit for occupancy for the purposes permitted under this Lease, and not occupied by Tenant as a result of the damage.     

(b) 
			 Landlord s Option to Repair  .  Notwithstanding the terms of   Paragraph 28(a)   of this Lease, Landlord may elect not to rebuild and/or restore the Premises, and/or any other portion of the Real Property and instead terminate this Lease by notifying Tenant in writing of such termination within sixty (60) days after the date of damage, such notice to include a termination date giving Tenant ninety (90) days to vacate the Premises, but Landlord may so elect only if the Building shall be damaged by fire or other casualty or cause, whether or not the Premises are affected, and one or more of the following conditions is present:  (i) repairs cannot reasonably be completed within twelve (12) months of the date of damage (when such repairs are made without the payment of overtime or other premiums); (ii) the holder of any Mortgage on the Building or ground or underlying lessor with respect to the Building and/or the Real Property will not permit the release of any insurance proceeds or shall require that the insurance proceeds or any portion thereof be used to pay down or retire the mortgage debt, or shall terminate the ground or underlying lease, as the case may be; (iii) the damage is not Substantially Covered, except for deductible amounts and self-insured retentions, by Landlord s insurance policies.  As used herein,    Substantially Covered    shall mean that the estimated cost of repair does not exceed the aggregate of the anticipated receipt of insurance policy payments, deductible payments and any self-insured retention amounts by more than Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($700,000.00); or (iv) in lieu of repairing damage resulting from a casualty, Landlord decides to redevelop the Land by demolishing the Buildings (either on or about the same time or in phases) and constructing new improvements on the Land and, if such casualty affects any other occupants of the Complex and if the lease or leases with such occupants grant Landlord a termination right with respect to such casualty, Landlord exercises its right to terminate the leases of any other such occupants of the Complex on or substantially about the date that Landlord exercises its right to terminate this Lease.  In addition, if the Premises or the Building is destroyed or damaged to any substantial extent (which shall mean, for the purposes of this   Paragraph 28(b)  , that the cost of performing the repair exceeds ten percent (10%) of the estimated replacement cost of the Building) during the last eighteen (18) months of the Term, then notwithstanding anything contained in this   Paragraph 28  , Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Tenant of the exercise of such option within sixty (60) days after such damage or destruction, in which event this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date that is thirty (30) days following notice.       

44 

Upon any such termination of this Lease pursuant to this   Paragraph 28  , all insurance proceeds available from the fire and property damage insurance carried by Tenant and covering the Tenant Improvements and any Alterations, but excluding proceeds allocable to trade fixtures, merchandise, signs and other personal property of Tenant, shall be disbursed and paid to Landlord, Tenant shall pay the Base Rent and Additional Rent (properly apportioned) up to such date of termination, and both parties hereto shall thereafter be freed and discharged of all further obligations hereunder, except as provided for in provisions of this Lease which by their terms survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.     

(c) 
			 Tenant s Termination Options  .  If the Premises are damaged by fire or other casualty and are rendered not reasonably usable for Tenant s business purposes thereby, or if the Building shall be so damaged that Tenant shall be deprived of reasonable access to the Premises, and if, pursuant to Landlord s Repair Notice, the restoration will not be substantially completed within fifteen (15) months following the date of such damage, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving written notice (the    Termination Notice   ) to Landlord not later than thirty (30) days following receipt of Landlord s Repair Notice.  If Tenant gives a Termination Notice, this Lease shall be deemed cancelled and terminated as of the date of the damage as if such date were the Expiration Date, and Rent shall be apportioned and shall be paid or refunded, as the case may be up to and including the date of such damage or destruction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant was entitled to, but elected not to, exercise its right to terminate this Lease as set forth above and Landlord does not substantially complete the repair and restoration of the Premises within three (3) months after the expiration of the estimated period of time set forth in Landlord s Repair Notice, which period shall be extended to the extent of any delays caused by Tenant and any events of Force Majeure (up to a maximum of one hundred fifty (150) days of additional extension for Force Majeure), then Tenant may deliver written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the expiration of such period, as the same may be so extended (a    Late Delivery Termination Notice   ), electing to terminate this Lease effective upon the date occurring thirty (30) days following receipt by Landlord of the Late Delivery Termination Notice (the    Termination Effective Date   ).  If Tenant delivers a Late Delivery Termination Notice to Landlord, then Landlord shall have the one-time right to nullify the Late Delivery Termination Notice (in which case the Late Delivery Termination Notice shall be of no force or effect) by delivering written notice to Tenant prior to the Termination Effective Date that, in Landlord s reasonable and good faith judgment, as evidenced by written statements from Landlord s architect and/or general contractor which will be included with the Termination Extension Notice (defined below), Landlord shall complete such repairs on or before the Termination Effective Date (the    Termination Extension Notice   ).  If Landlord does not so complete such repairs, then Tenant shall again have the right to terminate this Lease upon the delivery to Landlord of a second termination notice (the "  Second Termination Notice  ") within ten (10) business days after the Termination Effective Date, in which event this Lease shall terminate ten (10) business days after the date Tenant delivers the Second Termination Notice to Landlord unless the repairs are completed within such ten (10) business day period.  If Tenant fails to deliver a Second Termination Notice to Landlord within such ten (10) business day period, then this Lease shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however,   Tenant shall have the right to deliver a   Second Termination Notice to Landlord   during the first five (5) business days of each succeeding calendar month until such time as   Landlord completes the repairs.  Additionally, if the Premises, or any part thereof, or any portion of the Building necessary for Tenant s use of the Premises, are materially damaged (which shall mean, for the purposes of this   Paragraph 28(b)  , that the cost of performing the repair exceeds ten percent (10%) of the estimated replacement cost of the Building) or destroyed during the last twelve (12) months of the Term, or any extension thereof, Tenant may terminate this Lease by giving written notice thereof to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the date of the casualty, in which case this Lease shall terminate as of the later of the date of the casualty or the date of Tenant s vacation of the Premises.     

(d) 
			 Waiver of Statutory Provisions  .  The provisions of this Lease, including this   Article 11  , constitute an express agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to any and all      

45 

damage to, or destruction of, all or any part of the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Real Property, and any statute or regulation of the state of California, including, without limitation, Sections 1932(2) and 1933(4) of the California Civil Code, with respect to any rights or obligations concerning damage or destruction in the absence of an express agreement between the parties, and any other statute or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, shall have no application to this Lease or any damage or destruction to all or any part of the Premises, the Building or any other portion of the Real Property.    No endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any payment of Base Rent or such other sums shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept any such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to receive payment of the balance of such rent and/or other sums, or Landlord's right to pursue Landlord's remedies  .     

(a) 
			 Termination Upon Taking of Premises  .  If all or any part of the Premises shall be taken by any public or quasi-public authority under the power of eminent domain or conveyance in lieu thereof, this Lease shall terminate as to any portion of the Premises so taken or conveyed on the date when title vests in the condemnor.  Landlord shall be entitled to any and all payment, income, rent, award, or any interest therein whatsoever which may be paid or made in connection with such taking or conveyance, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or otherwise for the value of any unexpired Term of this Lease.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any compensation specifically awarded Tenant for loss of business, Tenant s personal property, moving costs or loss of goodwill, shall be and remain the property of Tenant.     

(b) 
			 Landlord s Termination Right  .  If (i) any action or proceeding is commenced by any public or quasi-public authority for such taking all or more than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises, (ii) any of the foregoing events occur with respect to the taking of space in the Complex not included in the Premises but necessary for the operation of, or access to, the Building, or (iii) any such spaces are taken or conveyed in lieu of such taking and in any such events Landlord shall decide to discontinue the use and operation of the Complex, or shall decide to demolish, alter or rebuild the Complex, then Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by giving Tenant written notice thereof within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of such written advice, or commencement of such action or proceeding, or taking conveyance, which termination shall take place as of the first to occur of the last day of the calendar month next following the month in which such notice is given or the date on which title to the Premises shall vest in the condemnor.     

(c) 
			 Tenant s Termination Right  .  In the event of such a partial taking or conveyance of the Premises, if the portion of the Premises taken or conveyed is so substantial that the Tenant can no longer reasonably conduct its business therein, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease within sixty (60) days from the date of such taking or conveyance, upon written notice to the Landlord of its intention so to do, and upon giving of such notice this Lease shall terminate on the last day of the calendar month next following the month in which such notice is given, upon payment by Tenant of the Rent from the date of such taking or conveyance to the date of termination.     

(d) 
			 Temporary Taking  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Paragraph 29  , in the event of a temporary taking of all or any portion of the Premises for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or less, then this Lease shall not terminate and there shall be no abatement of Rent.  In such event, Tenant shall be entitled to receive the entire award made in connection with any such temporary taking, provided that to the extent such award relates to the temporary taking of any other portion of the Complex, Landlord shall be entitled to such award to the extent relating to such other portions of the Complex.     

46 

(e) 
			 Adjustment of Rent if Lease Not Terminated  .  If a portion of the Premises shall be taken by condemnation or conveyance in lieu thereof and neither Landlord nor Tenant shall terminate this Lease as provided herein, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as to the part of the Premises not so taken or conveyed.  In such event the Rent herein shall be apportioned as of the date of such taking or conveyance so that thereafter the Rent to be paid by Tenant shall be in the ratio that the area of the portion of the Premises not so taken or conveyed bears to the total area of the Premises prior to such taking.     

30. 
			     SALE OR CONVEYANCE BY LANDLORD  . In the event of a sale or conveyance of the Premises by any owner of the reversion then constituting Landlord, and the assumption by the transferee of the obligations of Landlord hereunder, the transferor shall thereby be released from any further liability upon any of the terms, covenants or conditions (express or implied) herein contained in favor of Tenant arising after the effective date of the sale or conveyance, and in such event, insofar as such transfer is concerned, Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of such transferor (and not to the transferor) in and to the Complex and this Lease with respect to any obligation or liability of the  Landlord  arising after the effective date of such sale or conveyance.  This Lease shall not be affected by any such sale or conveyance, and Tenant agrees to attorn to the successor in interest of such transferor.      

31. 
			     EXTENSION AND EXPANSION RIGHTS  .

(ii) 
			 Co-Occupancy Condition  .  As used herein, the term    Co-Occupancy Condition   ) means that Other Building is then-being fully leased and is occupied by the then-existing tenant thereof (or any subtenants/assignees of such tenant) (or is scheduled to be leased and occupied by a replacement tenant or tenants who are have executed leases for the Other Building that are in full force and effect and whose effectiveness is not subject to any contingencies) (the    Existing Tenant   ) for a term (disregarding any renewal or extension options of the tenant or tenants) expiring not earlier than the last day of the Extension Term.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Co-Occupancy Condition initially is satisfied but subsequently fails to be satisfied at any time prior to the date that is ten (10) months before the commencement of the Extension Term due to the termination of the lease of the Other Building (including as the result of the rejection of the tenant s lease in bankruptcy or the termination of such lease as the result of casualty, the default of the tenant), Landlord may override Tenant s exercise of the Extension Option by giving written notice to Tenant not later than nine (9) months prior to the commencement of the Extension Term.  For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing, the      

47 

Co-Occupancy Condition may be satisfied if Tenant properly and timely exercises the Right of First Offer pursuant to   Paragraph 31(b)   concurrently with Tenant s exercise of the Extension Option.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon determination of the Prevailing Market Rent for the Extension Term in accordance with   Paragraph 31(c)  , an otherwise valid exercise of the Extension Option shall be fully effective whether or not the Extension Amendment is executed.     

(v) 
			 Delay in Determination  .  If the Prevailing Market Rent is not established prior to the commencement of the Extension Term, then Tenant shall continue to pay as Base Rent and Additional Rent the sums in effect as of the last day of the prior Term and, once the Prevailing Market Rent is determined, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of Landlord s invoice therefor, pay to Landlord any deficiency in the amount paid by Tenant during such period, or, if Tenant paid excess Base Rent during such period, Landlord shall credit such excess payments to the Base Rent amounts next due.

Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall have the right to hereafter negotiate and to enter into lease amendments or other agreements with the Existing Tenant (or any affiliate of the Existing Tenant) pursuant to which the term of the Existing Tenant s lease is extended, shortened, or otherwise modified, and any such modifications shall constitute Superior Rights.     

48 

(ii) 
			 Term  .  The term of the Right of First Offer (   Right of First Offer Term   ) shall commence on the date the Other Building becomes available for lease and shall terminate on the date that is sixteen (16) months prior to Expiration Date or the prior termination of the Right of First Offer as set forth in this   Paragraph 31(b)  .     

(iii)

(iv) 
			 Offer Notice  .  Subject to the terms and conditions in this   Paragraph 31(b)  , if during the Right of First Offer Term Landlord determines that the Other Building will become available for lease, Landlord shall first provide Tenant with a written notice (   Offer Notice   ) detailing (i) the proposed rent for the Other Building (based on rentable square feet), which shall be equal to the Prevailing Market Rent (as defined in   Paragraph 31(c)  ), (ii) the date the Other Building will become available for occupancy or the construction of improvements (the    Anticipated Other Building Delivery Date   ), (iii) the term of the proposed lease of the Other Building, which shall be concurrent with the Extended Term of this Lease under   Paragraph 31(a)  , and (iv) all other terms upon which Landlord proposes to lease the Other Building to Tenant.

Tenant s Acceptance Notice, if any, delivered to Landlord must expressly state that Tenant accepts all of the terms and conditions in the Offer Notice, without modification, and if Tenant s Acceptance Notice sets forth modifications of any kind, Tenant shall not be deemed to have delivered a valid Acceptance Notice and any such acceptance shall be null and void.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this   Paragraph 32(b)(v)   to the contrary, if Tenant wishes to exercise the Right of First Offer but in good faith disagrees with Landlord s determination of the Prevailing Market Rent as set forth in Landlord s Offer Notice, Tenant may nonetheless accept the offer by delivering an Acceptance Notice as provided above, but may elect to reserve its right to have the Fair Market Rent determined as provided in   Paragraph 32(c)   below, provided that any such reservation of rights shall not extend the time period for Tenant to deliver the Acceptance Notice.  If Tenant does not properly exercise its Right of First Offer within such twenty (20) day period, then Landlord shall thereafter be free to lease some or all of the Other Building to anyone without restriction and on such terms and conditions as Landlord may elect in its sole and absolute discretion, and in such event Tenant shall have no further rights under this   Section 31(b)  .     

(vi) 
			 Personal Right  .  Tenant s Right of First Offer shall be personal to the Tenant and any Permitted Transferees and shall not be transferable with any assignment of this Lease or subletting of the Premises.

			 Terms for Right of First Offer  .  In the event that Tenant exercises the Right of First Offer, Tenant s occupancy of the Other Building taken shall be on all of the same terms and conditions described in the Offer Notice and otherwise on the terms and conditions of this Lease.     

49 

(viii) 
			 Lease  .  If Tenant exercises the Right of First Offer and delivers an Acceptance Notice as and when required by this   Paragraph 31(b)  , Landlord and Tenant hereby agree to execute a lease (   Other Building Lease   ) prior to Tenant s occupancy of the Other Building.  The Other Building Lease shall not replace this Lease (which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms) but shall be in the same form as this Lease, subject to any modifications necessary to reflect the terms set forth in the Offer Notice (including, without limitation, the Base Rent, date of occupancy, description of the premises, the number of applicable parking spaces to be allocated to Tenant, Tenant s percentage share, the square footage of the Other Building, and any other changes needed due to the fact that Tenant will be leasing space in both Buildings).  If Tenant does not execute or provide Landlord with good faith and reasonable comments to such Other Building Lease within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Landlord delivers a draft Other Building Lease to Tenant, then, at Landlord s option to be exercised by notice delivered by Landlord on or before (x) the date that is ten (10) business days following the expiration of the such fifteen (15) day period and (y) Tenant s execution and delivery of (or delivery to Landlord of good faith and reasonable comments to) the Other Building Lease, Tenant s rights hereunder shall be void and terminated, but, otherwise, a valid exercise of Tenant s Right of First Offer shall be fully effective, whether or not such an Other Building Lease is executed.     

(c) 
			 Procedure for Determining Prevailing Market Rent  .  The Prevailing Market Rent shall be mutually agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant in writing within the thirty (30) calendar day period (the    Negotiation Period   ) following Tenant s delivery of an Extension Notice or an Acceptance Notice, as applicable.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable, despite good faith efforts, to agree upon the Prevailing Market Rent within the Negotiation Period, then the Prevailing Market Rent shall be established by appraisal in accordance with the procedures set forth below.     

(i) 
			 Within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the Negotiation Period, each party, at its cost, shall engage a real estate broker to act on its behalf in determining the Prevailing Market Rent.  The brokers each shall have at least ten (10) years  experience with leases in Relevant Market and shall submit to Landlord and Tenant in advance for Landlord s and Tenant s reasonable approval their statements of qualifications and the appraisal methods to be used.  If a party does not designate a broker within such fifteen (15) day period but a broker is timely designated by the other respective party, the single broker appointed shall be the sole broker and shall set the Prevailing Market Rent.  If the two brokers are appointed by the parties as stated in this paragraph, such brokers shall meet promptly and attempt to set the Prevailing Market Rent.  If such brokers are unable to agree within thirty (30) days after appointment of the second broker, the brokers shall elect a third broker meeting the qualifications stated in this paragraph within ten (10) days after the last date the two brokers are given to set the Prevailing Market Rent.  Each of the parties hereto shall bear one half (1/2) the cost of appointing the third broker and of the third broker s fee.  The third broker shall be a person who has not previously acted in any capacity for either party.  Once a party has selected a broker and negotiations have commenced between the brokers, such broker may not be replaced with another broker.     

(ii) 
			 The third broker shall conduct his or her own investigation of the Prevailing Market Rent, and shall be instructed not to advise either party of his or her determination of the Prevailing Market Rent except as follows:  When the third broker has made his or her determination, he or she shall so advise Landlord and Tenant and shall establish a date, at least five (5) days after the giving of notice by the third broker to Landlord and Tenant, on which he or she shall disclose his determination of the Prevailing Market Rent.  Such meeting shall take place in the third broker s office unless otherwise agreed by the parties.  After having initialed a paper on which his determination of Prevailing Market Rent is set forth, the third broker shall place his or her determination of the Prevailing Market Rent in a sealed envelope.  Landlord s broker and Tenant s broker shall each set forth their determination of Prevailing Market Rent on a paper, initial the same and place them in sealed envelopes.  Each of the three envelopes shall be marked with the name of the party whose determination is inside the envelope.     

50 

(iii) 
			 In the presence of the third broker, the determination of the Prevailing Market Rent by Landlord s broker and Tenant s broker shall be opened and examined.  If the higher of the two determinations is one hundred five percent (105%) or less of the amount set forth in the lower determination, the average of the two determinations shall be the Prevailing Market Rent, the envelope containing the determination of the Prevailing Market Rent by the third broker shall be destroyed and the third broker shall be instructed not to disclose his or her determination.  If either party s envelope is blank, or does not set forth a determination of Prevailing Market Rent, the determination of the other party shall prevail and be treated as the Prevailing Market Rent.  If the higher of the two determinations is more than one hundred five percent (105%) of the amount of the lower determination, the envelope containing the third broker s determination shall be opened.  If the value determined by the third broker is the average of the values proposed by Landlord s broker and Tenant s broker, the third broker s determination of Prevailing Market Rent shall be the Prevailing Market Rent.  If such is not the case, Prevailing Market Rent shall be the rent proposed by either Landlord s broker or Tenant s broker which is closest to the determination of Prevailing Market Rent by the third broker.     

(iv) 
			 Notwithstanding anything in   Paragraph 31(a)   to the contrary, in no event shall the Prevailing Market Rent (calculated on a per square foot basis) for the first year of the Extension Term of this Lease be less than the Base Rent and Additional Rent (calculated on a per square foot basis) payable in the last month of the initial Term of this Lease (the    Rent Floor   ).  Landlord and Tenant specifically acknowledge and agree that the Rent Floor shall apply if the Prevailing Market Rent is determined in connection with Tenant s exercise of the Extension Option under   Paragraph 31(a)   but shall not apply with respect to Tenant s lease of the Other Building if Tenant exercises the Right of First Offer under   Paragraph 31(b)  .     

(v) 
			 The parties expressly agree that the provisions of this   Paragraph 31(c)   shall be implemented in accordance with express terms of this   Paragraph 31(c)   and under such other procedures as the parties may agree to in their sole discretion, and except as expressly set forth above, shall not be subject to or governed by the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1280 et seq. as an arbitration, and all such arbitration provisions are hereby intentionally waived.     

(d) 
			 Definition of Prevailing Market Rent.    For purposes of   Paragraphs 31(a)   and   31(b)  , the term    Prevailing Market Rent    shall mean the fair-market, monthly rental rate per rentable square foot being charged (including the applicable periodic adjustments thereto) in  arms  length  direct leases (i.e., excluding subleases), on a net basis (i.e., excluding  full service  leases and  gross  leases for similarly sized office/research buildings located in the Relevant Market, as defined below (   Comparable Buildings   ); accordingly, for such purposes, any Comparable Transaction (defined below) used in order to determine Prevailing Market Rent which is a  full service  or  gross  lease, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the economic terms under such Comparable Transactions if such Comparable Transaction were a  triple net  lease).  Prevailing Market Rent shall be determined based upon leases for comparable transactions for comparable space entered into on or about the date on which the Prevailing Market Rent is being determined hereunder, for space in that portion of North San Jose that is within a twenty (20) block radius of the intersection of North First Street and Montague Expressway, excluding any portion of such radius that falls within the City of Santa Clara (   Comparable Transactions    and the    Relevant Market   , respectively).  If sufficient transactions regarding Comparable Buildings are not available for comparison purposes, adjustments shall be made in the determination of Prevailing Market Rent to reflect the age and quality of the Building (or the Other Building) as contrasted to other buildings used for comparison purposes, taking into consideration size, location, proposed term of the lease, extent of services to be provided, and the time that the particular rate under consideration became or is to become effective.  The intent of the parties is that Tenant will obtain the same rent and other economic benefits that landlords would otherwise give in Comparable Transactions and that Landlord will make and receive the same economic payments and concessions that landlords would otherwise make and receive in      

51 

Comparable Transactions.  The determination of Prevailing Market Rent shall take into account any material economic differences between the terms of this Lease or the Other Building Lease, as appropriate and any comparison lease or amendment, such as rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances and other concessions, and the manner, if any, in which the landlord under any such lease is reimbursed for operating expenses and taxes.  The determination of Prevailing Market Rent also shall take into consideration any reasonably anticipated changes in the Prevailing Market Rent from the time such Prevailing Market Rent is being determined and the time such Prevailing Market Rent will become effective under this Lease.     

(e) 
			 Redevelopment  .  Notwithstanding anything in this   Paragraph 31   to the contrary, Tenant shall have no right to exercise the Extension Option or the Right of First Offer and, if previously exercised, at Landlord s election, Tenant s exercise of the Extension Option and/or the Right of First Offer shall be null and void, if Landlord or any purchaser or other successor of Landlord s interest in the Complex, each in its sole and absolute discretion, intends to redevelop the Land by demolishing the Buildings (either on or about the same time or in phases) and constructing new improvements on the Land (   Landlord s Redevelopment Override Right   ).  If Tenant has exercised the Extension Option or the Right of First Offer as and when provided in this   Paragraph 31  , Landlord or any such purchaser or successor shall have the right to exercise Landlord s Redevelopment Override Right by notice delivered to Tenant (the    Override Notice   ) at any time prior to the date that is twelve (12) months prior to the date that the Extension Term (assuming Tenant has properly exercised the Extension Term) or the term of the Other Building Lease (assuming Tenant has properly exercised the Right of First Offer) is scheduled to commence.  Without limiting any circumstances evidencing Landlord s intent to redevelop the Complex, Landlord shall be deemed to intend to redevelop the Complex if Landlord or its successor has, prior to Landlord s delivery of the Override Notice, submitted a development plan to the City of San Jose for review (including preliminary review) or submitted an application to the City of San Jose for approvals or permits relating to the proposed redevelopment (including without limitation demolition permits, site development permits and/or building permits) (evidence of the foregoing to be included in Landlord s Override Notice).     

32. 
			     HOLDING OVER  . If Tenant (directly or through any Transferee or other successor-in-interest of Tenant) remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease with Landlord s consent but the parties do not otherwise expressly agree in writing on the terms of such holding over, such tenancy shall be from month-to-month only, and shall not constitute a renewal hereof or an extension for any further term.  In such event, Tenant shall continue to comply with and perform all the terms and obligations of Tenant under this Lease, except that the Base Rent during Tenant s holding over shall be one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the Base Rent payable in the last full month prior to the expiration or termination hereof, for the first (1st) fifteen (15) days of such holdover, and, thereafter, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Rent payable in the last full month prior to the expiration or termination hereof.  If Tenant holds over after the expiration of the Term without the consent of Landlord, such tenancy shall be a tenancy at sufferance, and shall not constitute a renewal hereof or an extension for any further term, and in such case daily damages in any action to recover possession of the Premises shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Rent applicable during the last rental period of the Term under this Lease (calculated on a per diem basis).  Acceptance by Landlord of rent after such expiration or termination shall not constitute a renewal of this Lease; and nothing contained in this provision shall be deemed to waive Landlord s right of reentry or any other right hereunder or at Law.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord and the other Indemnified Parties harmless from and against all Claims arising or resulting directly or indirectly from Tenant s failure to timely surrender the Premises, including (i) any rent payable by or any loss, cost, or damages claimed by any prospective tenant of the Premises, and (ii) Landlord s damages as a result of such prospective tenant rescinding or refusing to enter into the prospective lease of the      

52 

Premises or delaying the commencement of rent payable thereunder by reason of Tenant s failure to timely surrender the Premises.      

33. 
			     QUIET ENJOYMENT  . Landlord covenants that Tenant, on paying the Rent, charges for services and other payments herein reserved and on keeping, observing and performing the other terms herein contained on the part of Tenant to be kept, observed and performed, shall, during the Term, peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises subject to the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions and agreements hereof without interference by any party.      

34. 
			     CONSTRUCTION CHANGES  . It is specifically understood and agreed that Landlord has made no representation or warranty to Tenant and has no obligation and has made no promises to alter, remodel, improve, renovate, repair or decorate the Premises, Building, or any part thereof and that no representations respecting the condition of the Premises or the Building have been made by Landlord to Tenant except as specifically set forth herein or in the Tenant Work Letter.  However, Tenant hereby acknowledges that Landlord in the future may during the Term renovate, improve, alter, or modify (collectively, the "  Renovations  ") the Complex, including without limitation the Parking Areas and Common Areas.  In connection with any Renovations, Landlord may, among other things, erect scaffolding or other necessary structures in in the vicinity of the Building, temporarily limit or eliminate access to portions of the Complex, including portions of the Common Areas, or perform work outside of the Building, which work may create noise, dust or leave debris.  Any such work will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of   Paragraph 16(b)   above and   Paragraph 25   above.  Tenant hereby agrees that such Renovations, if carried out in accordance with this   Paragraph 34  , and Landlord s reasonable actions in connection with such Renovations shall in no way constitute a constructive eviction of Tenant nor, except as described in   Paragraph 16(b)  , entitle Tenant to any abatement of Rent.  Landlord shall have no responsibility or for any reason be liable to Tenant for any direct or indirect injury to or interference with Tenant s business arising from the Renovations, or for any inconvenience or annoyance occasioned by such Renovations or Landlord s actions.      

(a) 
			 In the event that either Landlord or Tenant should bring suit for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of any sum due under this Lease, or because of the breach or default of any provision of this Lease, or for any other relief against the other party hereunder, then all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees, incurred by the prevailing party therein shall be paid by the other party, which obligation on the part of the other party shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the commencement of such action and shall be enforceable whether or not the action is prosecuted to judgment.     

(b) 
			 Should Landlord be named as a defendant in any suit brought against Tenant in connection with or arising out of Tenant s occupancy hereunder and provided that the basis of such suit is not derived from the active negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord s architects, employees or representatives during the Term or the breach of Landlord of the terms of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord its costs and expenses incurred in such suit, including reasonable attorney s fees.     

37. 
			     WAIVER  . The waiver by either party of the other party s failure to perform or observe any term, covenant or condition herein contained to be performed or observed by such waiving party shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition or of any subsequent failure of the party failing to perform or observe the same or any other such term, covenant or condition therein contained, and no custom or practice which may develop between the parties hereto during the Term hereof shall be      

53 

deemed a waiver of, or in any way affect, the right of either party to insist upon performance and observance by the other party in strict accordance with the terms hereof.      

38.

In consideration of the benefits accruing hereunder, Tenant and all successors and assigns of Tenant covenant and agree that, in the event of any actual or alleged failure, breach or default hereunder by Landlord, or in the event of any other claim of any kind, whether arising from contract or tort, by Tenant against Landlord:

The installation, operation and maintenance of the Rooftop Equipment at the Building shall not adversely affect the structure or operating systems of the Building.  For purposes of determining Landlord's and Tenant's respective rights and obligations with respect to the use of the roof, the portion of the roof affected by the Rooftop Equipment shall be deemed to be a portion of the Premises (provided that such portion shall not be measured for purposes of determining the area of the Premises); consequently, all of the provisions of this Lease respecting Tenant's obligations hereunder shall apply to the installation, use and maintenance of the Rooftop Equipment, including without limitation provisions relating to compliance with requirements as to insurance, indemnity, repairs and maintenance.     

(c) 
			 Maintenance and Repair  .  Tenant shall maintain any Rooftop Equipment installed by or for Tenant at Tenant s sole cost and expense in accordance with   Paragraph 12  .

Tenant shall promptly reimburse Landlord for the costs of such an investigation, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys  fees Landlord incurs with respect to such investigation, that discloses Hazardous Materials contamination or non-compliance with Environmental Laws for which Tenant is liable under this Lease; otherwise, if such investigation results in a determination that Tenant has not violated the terms of this   Paragraph 46  , the cost of such investigation shall be borne solely by Landlord (and not included in Direct Expenses) constituted a violation of any Environmental Laws,.  Notwithstanding the above, Landlord may, at its option and in its sole and absolute discretion, choose to perform remediation and obtain reimbursement for cleanup costs as set forth herein from Tenant.

			 Tenant covenants, stipulates and agrees that the Lease and all of Tenant's right, title and interest in and to the Property thereunder   (including but not limited to any option to purchase, right of first refusal to purchase or right of first offer to purchase the Property or any portion thereof)   is hereby, and shall at all times continue to be, subordinated and made secondary and inferior in each and every respect to the Mortgage and the lien thereof, to all of the terms, conditions and provisions thereof and to any and all advances made or to be made thereunder, so that at all times the Mortgage shall be and remain a lien on the Property prior to and superior to the Lease for all purposes, subject to the provisions set forth herein.  Subordination is to have the same force and effect as if the Mortgage and such renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions had been executed, acknowledged, delivered and recorded prior to the Lease, any amendments or modifications thereof and any notice thereof.     

1 

2. 
			 Lender agrees that if Lender exercises any of its rights under the Mortgage, including entry or foreclosure of the Mortgage or exercise of a power of sale under the Mortgage, Lender will not disturb Tenant's right to use, occupy and possess the Premises under the terms of the Lease so long as Tenant is not in default beyond any applicable grace period under any term, covenant or condition of the Lease.     

3. 
			 If, at any time Lender (or any person, or such person's successors or assigns, who acquires the interest of Landlord under the Lease through foreclosure of the Mortgage or otherwise) shall succeed to the rights of Landlord under the Lease as a result of a default or event of default under the Mortgage, Tenant shall attorn to and recognize such person so succeeding to the rights of Landlord under the Lease (herein sometimes called    Successor Landlord   ) as Tenant's landlord under the Lease, said attornment to be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further instruments.  Although said attornment shall be self-operative, Tenant agrees to execute and deliver to Lender or to any Successor Landlord, such other instrument or instruments as Lender or such other person shall from time to time reasonably request in order to confirm said attornment.     

4. 
			 Landlord authorizes and directs Tenant to honor any written demand or notice from Lender instructing Tenant to pay rent or other sums to Lender rather than Landlord (a    Payment Demand   ), regardless of any other or contrary notice or instruction which Tenant may receive from Landlord before or after Tenant's receipt of such Payment Demand.  Tenant may rely upon any notice, instruction, Payment Demand, certificate, consent or other document from, and signed by, Lender and shall have no duty to Landlord to investigate the same or the circumstances under which the same was given.  Any payment made by Tenant to Lender or in response to a Payment Demand shall be deemed proper payment by Tenant of such sum pursuant to the Lease.     

5. 
			 If Lender shall become the owner of the Property or the Property shall be sold by reason of foreclosure or other proceedings brought to enforce the Mortgage or if the Property shall be transferred by deed in lieu of foreclosure, Lender or any Successor Landlord shall not be:     

(a)

(b) 
			 liable for any defaults of any prior landlord (including Landlord) which occurred, or (except as set forth in 5(a) above) to make any payment to Tenant which was required to be paid by any prior landlord (including Landlord), prior to the time that Lender or any Successor Landlord succeeded to the interest of such landlord under the Lease; or     

(c) 
			 obligated to perform any construction obligations of any prior landlord (including Landlord) under the Lease or liable for any defects (latent, patent or otherwise) in the design, workmanship, materials, construction or otherwise with respect to improvements and buildings constructed on the Property; or     

(d) 
			 subject to any offsets, defenses or counterclaims which Tenant may be entitled to assert against any prior landlord (including Landlord); or     

2 

(e) 
			 bound by any payment of rent or additional rent by Tenant to any prior landlord (including Landlord) for more than one month in advance; or     

(f) 
			 bound by any amendment, modification, termination or surrender of the Lease (other than any amendment, modification, termination or surrender reflecting or representing the exercise by Tenant of an express right or option set forth in the Lease) made without the written consent of Lender; or     

(g) 
			 liable or responsible for or with respect to the retention, application and/or return to Tenant of any security deposit paid to any prior landlord (including Landlord), whether or not still held by such prior landlord, unless and until Lender or any Successor Landlord has actually received said deposit for its own account as the landlord under the Lease as security for the performance of Tenant's obligation under the Lease (which deposit shall, nonetheless, be held subject to the provisions of the Lease).     

6. 
			 Tenant hereby represents, warrants, covenants and agrees to and with Lender:     

(a) 
			 to deliver to Lender, by certified mail, return receipt requested or nationally recognized overnight courier, a duplicate of each notice of default delivered by Tenant to Landlord at the same time as such notice is given to Landlord and no such notice of default shall be deemed given by Tenant under the Lease unless and until a copy of such notice shall have been so delivered to Lender.  Lender shall have the right (but shall not be obligated) to cure such default.  Tenant shall accept performance by Lender of any term, covenant, condition or agreement to be performed by Landlord under the Lease with the same force and effect as though performed by Landlord.  Tenant further agrees that if Lender, within thirty (30) days following Tenant s delivery of any such notice of default to Lender, notifies Tenant of Lender s intent to attempt to cure such default, Tenant will afford Lender a period of thirty (30) days beyond any period afforded to Landlord for the curing of such default during which period Lender may elect (but shall not be obligated) to seek to cure such default, or, if such default cannot be cured within that time but Lender is diligently attempting to cure such default, then such additional time as may be necessary to cure such default (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings) during which period Lender may continue to seek to cure such default, prior to taking any action to terminate the Lease.     

(b) 
			 that Tenant is the sole owner of the leasehold estate created by the Lease; and     

(c) 
			 to promptly certify in writing to Lender, in connection with any proposed assignment of the Mortgage, whether or not any default on the part of Landlord then exists under the Lease and to deliver to Lender any tenant estoppel certificates required under the Lease.     

7. 
			 Tenant acknowledges that the interest of Landlord under the Lease is assigned to Lender solely as security for the Promissory Note, and Lender shall have no duty, liability or obligation under the Lease or any extension or renewal thereof, unless Lender shall      

3 

specifically undertake such liability in writing or Lender becomes and then only with respect to periods in which Lender becomes, the fee owner of the Property.     

8. 
			 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State in which the Premises is located (excluding the choice of law rules thereof).     

9. 
			 This Agreement and each and every covenant, agreement and other provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any successor holder of the Promissory Note) and may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified only by an instrument in writing executed by the party against which enforcement of the termination, amendment, supplement, waiver or modification is sought.     

10. 
			 All notices to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed served upon receipt by the addressee if served personally or, if mailed, upon the first to occur of receipt or the refusal of delivery as shown on a return receipt, after deposit in the United States Postal Service certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the address of Landlord, Tenant or Lender appearing below.
