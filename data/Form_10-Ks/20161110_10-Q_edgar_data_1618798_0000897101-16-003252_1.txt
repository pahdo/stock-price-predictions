  Note 1   Basis of Financial Statement Presentation   
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Ben Franklin Financial, Inc. (the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiary Ben Franklin Bank of Illinois (the  Bank ) have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, the statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that were included in the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December     31, 2015. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments necessary (i)     for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods included herein and (ii)     to make such financial statements not misleading have been made and are of a normal and recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.   
  In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For further information with respect to significant accounting policies followed by the Company in preparation of the financial statements, refer to the Company s 2015 Annual Report.   
  The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank and a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) system. The Bank maintains insurance on deposit accounts with the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).  

Note 2   Recurring Losses   
  The Company has incurred losses since 2008. The Company recently incurred net losses of $ 890  for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 and $ 1,032  during the year ended December     31, 2015.     The losses are largely due to declining interest earning assets and our non-interest expenses exceeding our net interest income. Non-interest expense has been impacted by the increase in our professional fees and in 2016, an operational loss not reimbursable from our insurance. Despite these losses, the Bank s total capital to risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage capital to average assets ratio were  16.84 % and  9.70 % respectively, at September     30, 2016.   
  The Company had $ 304  and $ 334  of cash at September     30, 2016 and December     31, 2015.     The Company completed the public offering of common stock in January 2015, raising $ 2,504 , net of $ 1,401  in conversion costs. The proceeds of the public stock offering were used to contribute $ 2,000  of additional capital to the Bank. In addition, $ 273  of the net proceeds were used to fund the loan to the employee stock ownership plan and approximately $ 314  of the net proceeds were retained by Ben Franklin Financial, Inc.   
  On November     25, 2015 the Bank entered into a revised Consent Order (the  New Order ) with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) that  reduced  the Bank s regulatory compliance burden. Concurrent with the execution of the New Order, the Bank s prior Consent Order (the  Old Order ) entered into between the Bank and the OCC dated December     19, 2012 was terminated. The New Order is comprised of  two  substantive articles as opposed to  12  substantive articles under the Old Order. The New Order reduced the Bank s minimum required Tier 1 leverage capital ratio to  8 % from  9 % under the Old Order and its minimum total risk-based capital ratio to  12 % from  13 % under the Old Order. The New Order requires the Bank to revise its current capital plan to include a capital distribution policy. Additionally, the New Order requires the Bank to revise its strategic plan to identify parameters and triggers which would cause the board of directors to market the Bank for merger or sale, in the event it failed to meet the  8 % and  12 % capital requirements under the New Order. The New Order continues to require quarterly reporting to the OCC and board monitoring requirements. At September     30, 2016 and December     31, 2015 the Bank was in compliance with the required minimum ratios.   
  If the Bank is unable to meet the capital requirements and other requirements of the New Order, the OCC may institute other corrective measures and has enforcement powers to impose additional restrictions on the Bank s operations, including seizure. Although management believes that it will successfully maintain the required capital ratios, there can be no assurance that they will be able to do so, nor that they will be able to comply fully with the provisions of the Order. Only the OCC has the  authority  to determine whether or not the provisions of the New Order have been met.

Note 3   New Accounting Standards   
 
  In January 2016 the FASB released accounting standards update 2016-01 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities. The main provisions of the update are to eliminate the available for sale classification of accounting for equity securities and to adjust the fair value disclosures for financial instruments carried at amortized costs such that the disclosed fair values represent an exit price as opposed to an entry price. The provisions of this update will require that equity securities be carried at fair market value on the balance sheet and any periodic changes in value will be adjustments to the income statement. A practical expedient is provided for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, such that these securities can be carried at cost less any impairment. The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December     15,     2017. Management does not expect the requirements of this update to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
  In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-02 Leases. The update requires all leases, with the exception of short-term leases that have contractual terms no greater than  one  year, to be recorded on the balance sheet. Under the provisions of the update, leases classified as operating will be reflected on the balance sheet with the recognition of both a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Under the update, a distinction will exist between finance and operating type leases and the rules for determining which classification a lease will fall into are similar to existing rules. For public business entities, the amendments of this update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December     15, 2018. The update requires a modified retrospective transition under which comparative balance sheets from the earliest historical period presented will be revised to reflect what the financials would have looked like were the provisions of the update applied consistently in all prior periods. Management has not yet determined the impacts of this update on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
  In March 2016 the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation. The purpose of the update was to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences of such transactions. Under the provisions of the update the income tax consequences of excess tax benefits and deficiencies should be recognized in income tax expense in the reporting period in which the awards vest. Currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies impact stockholders  equity directly to the extent there is a cumulative excess tax benefit. In the event that a tax deficiency has occurred during the reporting period and a cumulative excess tax benefit does not exist, the tax deficiency is recognized in income tax expense under current GAAP. The update also provides that entities may continue to estimate forfeitures in accounting for stock based compensation or recognize them as they occur. The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December     15, 2016. The update requires a modified retrospective transition under which a cumulative effect to equity will be recognized in the period of adoption. Management does not expect the requirements of this update to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
  In June 2016 the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-13 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The main objective of this update is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The provisions of this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December     15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management has not yet determined the impacts of this update on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The provisions of this update become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not expect the requirements of this update to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 4   Securities Available for Sale   
 
  The amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:   

There were no sales of securities available-for-sale during the nine months ended September     30, 2016 or 2015. There were no securities pledged to secure any of the borrowings of the Company as of September     30, 2016 and December     31, 2015.   
  The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities are shown by contractual maturity as of September     30, 2016. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Securities not due at a single maturity date are shown separately.    

Anticipated maturities on mortgage-backed securities are not readily determinable as borrowers have the right to prepay their obligation with or without penalties.   
 
   The following table summarizes securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December     31, 2015, aggregated by major security type and length of time in a continuous unrealized loss position.   

As of September     30, 2016 and December     31, 2015, all of the Company s securities available for sale were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies which the government has affirmed its commitment to support.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

Unrealized losses on securities have not been recognized into income because the issuer s securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher at the time of purchase), management does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that management would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.

Credit Quality Indicators   
  The Bank categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of a borrower to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Bank analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. The analysis includes the non-homogeneous loans, such as multi- family, commercial real estate, construction, and commercial loans. The analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. Homogeneous loans are monitored based on past  due  status of the loan. The risk category of these loans is evaluated at origination, when a loan becomes delinquent or when a borrower requests a concession.   
  Substandard   
  Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.   
  Doubtful   
  Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.   
  Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.   The following table reflects the risk category by loans at the dates indicated based on the most recent analysis performed.

Troubled Debt Restructurings   
  Our troubled debt restructurings totaled $ 1,644  at September      30 ,  2016  and $ 1,964  at December      31 ,  2015 . There were no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during the nine months ended September      30 ,  2016  or the year ended December      31 ,  2015 .   
  There were  two  loans modified as troubled debt restructurings with a balance of $ 402  as of September      30 ,  2016 , which are being reported as nonaccrual. There were  two  loans modified as troubled debt restructurings with a balance of $ 415  which are being reported as nonaccrual as of December      31 ,  2015 ,  one  of which totaling $ 69  is paying as agreed under the terms of the modification.   
  A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is  90  days contractually past  due  under the modified terms. During the nine months ended September      30 ,  2016 ,  one  multi-family loan totaling $ 346  had payment defaults and was reported as non-accrual at September      30 ,  2016  and December      31 ,  2015 .   
  The Company has allocated $ 134  to specific reserves on $ 1,587  of loans to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of September      30 ,  2016 . At December      31 ,  2015 , the Company has allocated $ 119  to specific reserves on $ 1,271  of loans to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. The Company has not committed to lend additional amounts as of September      30 ,  2016  and December      31 ,  2015  to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings.  

Note 6   Loss Per Share   
 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the components used to compute basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:   

The outstanding options and restricted shares are considered antidilutive because of the net loss.  

Note 7   Fair Value Measures   
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are  three  levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:   
  Level  1    Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.   
  Level  2    Significant other observable inputs other than Level  1  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.   
  Level  3    Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.   
  The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument:   

Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited)   

Securities Available for Sale  : The fair values of securities available-for-sale are determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level  2  inputs).   
  Impaired Loans  :     The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level  3  classification of the inputs for determining fair value.     Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level  3  fair value classification.     Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.  
  Repossessed Assets  : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis.     These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level  3  classification of the inputs for determining fair value.     Other real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.  
  Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified appraisers whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.     Once received, management reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.     Upon sale of collateral, the Company compares the actual selling price of collateral that has been sold to the most recent appraised value to determine what additional adjustment should be made to the appraisal value to arrive at fair value for the remaining assets carried at fair value.

Note 8   Regulatory Capital Matters   
  The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. The final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s capital guidelines for U.S. banks (Basel Ill rules) became effective for the Company on January     1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January     1, 2019. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital.   
  Effective as of January      1 , 2016, financial institutions are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and other payments. If a financial institution s capital conservation buffer falls below the minimum requirement, its maximum payout amount for capital distributions and discretionary payments declines to a set percentage of eligible retained income based on the size of the buffer. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on    January     1, 2016    at the  0.625 % level and will be phased in over a  three -year period (increasing by  0.625 % on each subsequent January     1, until it reaches  2.5 % on    January     1, 2019   ). As of September     30, 2016, the Bank s capital conservation buffer stood at  8.84 %.   
  Quantitative measures established by regulation to help ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital as defined in the regulations to risk-weighted assets as defined and of Tier I capital to adjusted total assets as defined. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios. On November     25, 2015 the Bank entered into a New Order with the OCC that r educed  the Bank s regulatory compliance burden. Concurrent with the execution of the New Order, the Old Order entered into between the Bank and the OCC dated December     19, 2012 was terminated. The New Order reduced the Bank s minimum required Tier 1 leverage capital ratio to  8 % from  9 % under the Old Order and its minimum total risk-based capital ratio to  12 % from  13 % under the Old Order.

As a result of entering into the New Order to achieve and maintain specific capital levels, the Bank s capital classification under the Prompt Corrective Action rules was  adequately capitalized  at September     30, 2016 and December     31, 2015. While under the New and Old Order, the Bank cannot be consider  well capitalized .   
  The prompt corrective action regulations provide  five  classifications, including well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If undercapitalized, asset growth and expansion are limited and plans for capital restoration are required.

Item      2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
  Forward-Looking Statements   
  This quarterly report may contain statements relating to the future results of the Company (including certain projections and business trends) that are considered  forward-looking statements  as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of  1995  (the  PSLRA ). Such forward-looking statements, in addition to historical information, which involve risk and uncertainties, are based on the beliefs, assumptions and expectations of management. Words such as  expects,   believes,   should,   plans,   anticipates,   will,   potential,   could,   intend,   may,   outlook,   predict,   project,   would,   estimates,   assumes,   likely,  and variations of such similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions, and expectations; statements regarding our business plans and prospects and growth and operating strategies; statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. For this presentation, the Company and its subsidiary claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the PSLRA.   
  Factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include, but are not limited to: our ability to manage the risk from our  one -to  four -family, home equity line-of-credit, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, land, commercial business, and automobile lending including purchased loans; our ability to comply with the terms of the Consent Order (the  Order ) entered into between the Bank and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC  the future level of deposit insurance premiums applicable to us; significantly increased competition among depository and other financial institutions; our ability to execute our plan to grow our assets on a profitable basis; changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments; inflation; general economic conditions, both nationally and in our market area; adverse changes in the securities and national and local real estate markets (including loan demand, housing demand, and real estate values); our ability to originate a satisfactory amount of high quality loans in an unfavorable economic environment; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business including the effect of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, our ability to enter new markets successfully and take advantage of growth opportunities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies and the authoritative accounting bodies; the performance of our investment in FHLB of Chicago stock; changes in our organization, compensation and benefit plans; and other factors. Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading  Risk Factors.  The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and the Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.   
  New Capital Requirements   
  In July, 2014, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets, to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.     The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $ 500  million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies ( banking organizations ).     Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier  1  minimum capital requirement ( 4.5%  of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier  1  capital to risk-based assets requirement (from  4 % to  6%  of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight ( 150 %)     to exposures that are more than  90  days past  due  or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.     The final rule also limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of  2.5 % of common equity Tier  1  capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.     The final rule became effective for us on January      1 ,  2015 . The capital conservation buffer requirement began at 0.625% January      1 ,  2016  and becomes fully phased in at  2.5 % on January      1 ,  2019 .

General   
  The Bank is a federally chartered savings bank headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois. The Bank was originally founded in  1893  as a building and loan association. We conduct our business from our main office and  one  branch office. Both of our offices are located in the northwestern corridor of the Chicago metropolitan area.   
  Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in  one - to  four -family residential mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, home equity lines-of-credit, commercial real estate loans, multi-family real estate loans, commercial business loans, construction and land loans, automobile, and other loans. We also invest in mortgage-backed and other securities. Our revenues are derived principally from the interest on loans and securities, fees for loan origination services, loan fees, and fees levied on deposit accounts. Our primary sources of funds are deposits and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.   
  Our strategic plan to increase income includes growing our loan portfolio through a combination of our internal origination efforts and through the acquisition of loan pools from other sources.  We believe we must continue to increase our level of higher interest earning assets to become profitable.  During 2016, the Bank experienced a number of personnel changes within the lending department that impacted our ability to generate the origination levels in our plan. The changes included the departure of our primary lending officer and his subsequent replacement several months later. This position is primarily responsible for our residential lending portfolio and fee generation through originations for other institutions. At the end of October 2016, we hired a senior loan officer to assume the Chief Lending Officer position. This function had been the responsibility of the Bank s President. The new Chief Lending Officer will be responsible for the implementing strategies to attain our loan origination goals as well as overseeing our credit and loan administration functions. Prior to accepting this position, this individual provided loan consulting service to the Bank since March of 2016. We believe that our new  loan department  structure along with our other referral sources, will help us meet our future production goals. While we have been presented with several pool purchase opportunities, we have not identified any that meet our strategic income and risk objectives. We may still pursue pool purchases in the future.  
  Based on the above, we do not anticipate net income until we experience significant growth in our earning assets base pursuant to our business plan. There can be no assurances, however, that we will successfully execute on our business plan and be able to return to profitability in the timeframe we expect or at all.   
  Critical Accounting Policies   
  Certain of our accounting policies are important to the reporting of our financial results, since they require management to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in performance of the local economy, changes in the financial condition of borrowers, and changes in value of loan collateral such as real estate. As discussed in the Company s Annual Report for the year ended December      31 , 2015, management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and accounting for deferred income taxes.   
  Comparison of Financial Condition at September      30 ,  2016  and December      31 ,  2015    
  Assets.   Total assets at September     30, 2016 were $ 79.9  million compared to $ 84.1  million at December     31, 2015, a  decrease  of $ 4.2  million, or  5.0% . This decrease was primarily due to the $ 3.0  million  decrease  in the balance of our securities available for sale, the $ 2.0   decrease  in our loan portfolio, and the $ 715,000   decrease  in our certificate of deposits in other financial institutions, partially offset by the $ 732,000   increase  in the balance of our premise and equipment and $ 493,000   increase  in our cash and cash equivalents.   
  The decrease in our loan portfolio balance during the first  nine  months of 2016 was primarily  due  to the $ 2.6  million decrease in our  one - to  four  family residential loan portfolio and $ 357,000  decrease in our automobile loan portfolio, partially offset by the $ 393,000  increase in our home equity line- of -credit loan portfolio and the $ 304,000  increase in our multi-family loan portfolio. The decrease in our  one - to  four  family residential loan portfolio was primarily  due  to the repayments from existing loans exceeding the $ 2.2  million of new loans originated. Management has reviewed several options for the purchase of loan pools from other sources as outlined in our strategic plan to supplement our internal origination, however, we have not identified a pool that meets our strategic income and risks objectives.  

Table of Contents  

At September     30, 2016 our allowance for loan losses was $ 962,000 , or  1.70 % of total loans, compared to $ 991,000 , or  1.69 % of total loans, at December     31, 2015. Our allowance reflected $ 110,000  of recoveries for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 primarily from the $ 86,000  recovery from the discounted payoff of a multi-family loan and a credit for loan losses of $ 128,000 , partially offset by an $ 11,000  charge-off related to a residential loan that was transferred to other real estate owned. Our loans classified as substandard or doubtful, which also represents our non-accrual loans, were $ 1.7  million or  2.95 % of total loans at September     30, 2016 compared to $ 1.4  million or  2.47 % of total loans at December     31, 2015. The increase reflects the downgrade of a $ 542,000  loan secured by a commercial real estate property, partially offset by the transfer of a residential loan with a book value of $ 293,000  to other real estate owned. Our loans classified as TDRs totaled $ 1.6  million at September     30, 2016 of which $ 1.2  million were accruing, compared to $ 2.0  million at December 31, 2015 of which $ 1.5  million was accruing. The decrease was primarily due to the discounted payoff of a loan secured by a multi-family property.  
  Our securities portfolio  decreased  $ 3.0  million or  28.5%  to $ 7.5  million at September     30, 2016 compared to $ 10.5  million at December     31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the call of $ 8.0  million of government sponsored entities notes and the repayments on mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the purchase of $ 4.0  million of fixed rate callable notes with maturities of four years or less and $ 1.0  million of a  15  year fixed rate mortgage-backed security. Our cash and cash equivalents  increase  $ 493,000  to $ 9.8  million at September     30, 2016. Our certificates of deposit with other financial institutions  decreased  $ 715,000  primarily due to the maturity of $ 3.7  million of such certificates of deposit, partially offset by the purchase of $ 2.9  million.   
  Our premises and equipment  increased  $ 732,000  or  154.1%  primarily due to the leasehold improvements, furniture, and equipment for our branch office that we upgraded and relocated within the existing shopping center. The new office opened on July 5, 2016. Total costs for leasehold improvements and equipment for the branch office totaled $   780,000 .   
  Liabilities.   Our total liabilities  decreased  $ 3.3  million or  4.4%  to $ 71.3  million at September     30, 2016. Our deposits  decreased  by $ 3.1  million or  4.2%  to $ 70.5  million at September     30, 2016 compared to $ 73.6  million at December     31, 2015, primarily due to the $ 2.0  million or  5.6%   decrease  in our certificate of deposit accounts the $ 1.3  million or  10.1%   decrease  in our money market accounts, and the $ 1.1  million or  7.8 % decrease in our checking accounts, partially offset by the $ 1.4  million or  12.9%   increase  in the balance of our savings accounts.  
  Stockholders  Equity.   Total stockholders  equity at September     30, 2016 was $ 8.5  million, a  decrease  of $ 873,000  or  9.3%  from December     31, 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from our net loss of $ 890  for the nine months ended September      30 ,  2016 .   
  Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September     30, 2016 and 2015   
  General.   For the three months ended September     30, 2016 our net loss was $ 280,000  compared to a net loss of $ 142,000  for the three months ended September     30, 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily due to the decreases in our non-interest income and the increase in our non-interest expense, partially offset by the credit for loan losses.   
  Interest Income.   Interest income was $ 756,000  for the three months ended September     30, 2016, $ 4,000 , or  0.5% ,  lower  than the prior year period. Interest income from our loan portfolio  decreased  $ 3,000  or  0.4% . The average balance of our loan portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2016  was  $ 314,000    lower  than    the prior year period primarily due to the $ 1.9  million decrease in our one- to four-family residential loans, the $ 444,000  decrease in our consumer loans and the $ 303,000  decrease in our home equity line-of-credit loans. These decreases were partially offset by the $ 1.7  million increase in the average balance of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans and the $ 517,000  increase in our commercial business loans. The yield on our loan portfolio was  5.03%  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to  4.99%  the prior year period.  
  Interest income from securities  decreased  $ 6,000  or  16.7%  to $ 30,000  for the three months ended September     30, 2016 primarily due to the $ 2.8  million  decrease  in the average balance of our securities portfolio to $ 8.5  million. The average yield for our securities portfolio was  1.42%  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to  1.26%  for the prior year period. Interest income from other interest earning assets  increased  $ 5,000  or  31.3%  to $ 21,000  for the three months ended September     30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The average balance of our other interest earning assets  decreased  $ 4.1  million primarily due to the decrease in our customer deposits while the yield  increased   0.26%  to  0.63%  for the three months ended September     30, 2016 as we purchased certificates of deposit from other financial institutions to increase our interest income. The balance of each certificate of deposit was less than $ 250,000  with maturities that ranged from nine to 18 months. The average balance of the certificates of deposit for the three months ended September     30, 2016 totaled $ 3.5  million compared to $ 5.0  million in the comparable period of 2015.

Interest Expense.   Interest expense for the three months ended September     30, 2016 was $ 81,000 , a  decrease  of $ 11,000  or  12.0%  from the prior year period due to the decrease in interest expense on deposits as the average balance of interest bearing deposits  decreased   $  5.0    million. The average balance of our certificate of deposit accounts  decreased  $ 4.3  million to $ 33.6  million, the average balance of our money market accounts  decreased  $ 1.4  million, and the average balance of our checking accounts decreased $ 988,000 .

The average cost of deposits decreased to  0.49%  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to  0.51%  for the prior year period.

For the three months ended September     30, 2016, the average yield on interest-earning assets was  3.90%  and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was  0.49%  compared to  3.56%  and  0.51% , respectively, for the three months ended September     30, 2015. These changes resulted in a net interest rate spread and net interest margin to  3.41%  and  3.48%  respectively for the three months ended September     30, 2016 compared to a net interest rate spread of  3.05%  and net interest margin of  3.13%  for the prior year period. The increase in the net interest rate spread and margin was primarily due to the increase in the yield of our investments and other interest earning assets.  
  Provision for Loan Losses.   We had a $ 95,000  credit for loan losses for the three months ended September     30, 2016 compared to a $ 55,000  provision for the three months ended September     30, 2015. The credit was primarily the result of an $ 86,000  recovery on the discounted payoff of a loan secured by a multi-family property partially offset by an $ 11,000  charge-off on a residential loan that was transferred to other real estate owned. Our provision for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the $ 284,000  charge-off taken during the quarter on a residential property. At September 30, 2016, management concluded that the balance in our allowance for loan losses appropriately reflected the probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio based on an analysis of the Bank s historical loss history and other current factors including market values and current economic conditions and trends.  
  Non-interest Income.   For the three months ended September     30, 2016, non-interest income was $ 25,000  compared to $ 188,000  for the three months ended September     30, 2015 primarily due to the $ 141,000  gain on the sale of a residential real estate property in third quarter of 2015. Fees for originating loans for other financial institutions  decreased  $ 17,000  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.  
  Non-interest Expense.   For the three months ended September     30, 2016, our non-interest expense  increased  $ 119,000  or  12.5%  compared to the prior year period. Repossessed assets costs  increased  $ 76,000  primarily due to the $ 68,000  write-down of a commercial real estate property for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $ 14,000  for the prior year period. Professional fees  increased  $ 29,000  primarily due to the $ 10,000  increase for other consulting fees, and the $ 17,000  increase in our legal fees. Our other costs  increased  $ 54,000  or  64.3%  primarily due to the $ 5,000  provision for off balance sheet commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the $ 15,000  recovery the prior year period; the $ 17,000  increase in marketing costs primarily related to the new office relocation; and $ 17,000  real estate taxes for loans in the processes of foreclosure. Our occupancy costs  increased  $ 19,000  primarily due to the increase in our depreciation expense for the leasehold improvements for our branch office. Our compensation and employee benefit costs  decreased  $ 56,000  or  11.7%  primarily due to the staffing changes and salary adjustment that were implemented in 2015 and the beginning of 2016.   
  Income Tax.   We recorded immaterial amounts for income taxes for the three months ended September     30, 2016 and 2015.   
  Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September     30, 2016 and 2015   
  General.   For the nine months ended September     30, 2016 our net loss was $ 890,000  compared to a net loss of $ 787,000  for the nine months ended September     30, 2015. The increase in our net loss was primarily due to the decrease in our non-interest income and increase in our non-interest expenses, partially offset by the credit for loan losses.  
  Interest Income.   Interest income was $ 2.2  million for the nine months ended September     30, 2016, $ 34,000 , or  1.5% ,  lower  than the prior year period. Interest income from loans was $ 2.0  million, $ 70,000  or  3.3%   lower  for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due to $ 1.4  million  decrease  in   the average balance of our loan portfolio. The  decrease in   average balance included  decreases of  $ 1.9  million in our one- to four-family residential loans, $ 1.6  million in our home equity line-of-credit loans, and $ 505,000  in our consumer loans. These decreases were partially offset by the $ 2.2  million increase in the average balance of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans and the $ 452,000  increase in  the average balance of  our commercial business loans. The average yield on loans for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 was  4.86%  compared to  4.90% .   

Table of Contents  

Interest income from securities  increased  $ 7,000  or  7.4%  to $ 102,000  for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 primarily due to the increase in yield on our securities to  1.44%  for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 compared to  1.33%  for the prior year period. Interest income from other interest earning assets  increased  $ 29,000  or  82.9%  to $ 64,000  for the nine months ended September     30, 2016. The average balance of our other interest earning assets  decreased  $ 4.5  million primarily  due  to the decrease in the average balance of our deposits, while the yield increased to  0.62%  from  0.26%  as we purchased certificates of deposit in other financial institutions to increase our interest income. The balance of each certificate of deposit was less than $ 250,000  with maturities that ranged from nine to 18 months. The average balance of the certificates of deposit for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 totaled $ 4.0  million compared to $ 2.4  million for the prior your period.   
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 was $ 238,000 , a  decrease  of $ 40,000  or  14.4%  from the prior year period due to the decrease in interest expense on deposits. The average balance of interest bearing deposits  decreased  $ 5.1  million for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 compared to the prior year period as the average   balance of our certificate of deposit accounts  decreased  $ 5.4  million to $ 33.6  million, and the average balance of our checking and money market accounts  decreased  $ 1.3  million. These decrease was partially offset by the $ 1.6  million  increase  in the average balance of our savings accounts for the nine months ended September     30, 2016. The average cost of deposits decreased to  0.47%  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to  0.52%  for the prior year period.  
  Net Interest Income.   Net interest income for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 was $ 2.0  million, relatively unchanged from the nine months ended September     30, 2015. For the nine months ended September     30, 2016, the average yield on interest-earning assets was  3.72%  and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was  0.47%  compared to an average yield of  3.51%  and average cost of  0.52% , respectively, for the nine months ended September     30 2015. These changes resulted in an  increase  in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin to  3.25%  and  3.32%  respectively for the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net interest rate spread of  2.99%  and net interest margin of  3.08%  for the prior year period. The increase in the net interest rate spread and margin was primarily due to the increase in the yield of our investments and other interest earning assets.  
  Provision for Loan Losses.   We had a $ 128,000  credit for loan losses for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 compared to a $ 55,000  provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The credit was primarily the result of an $ 86,000  recovery on the discounted payoff of a loan secured by a multi-family property and a $ 24,000  recovery from a residential construction loan, partially offset by an $ 11,000  charge-off on a residential loan that was transferred to other real estate owned. Our provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the $ 284,000  charge-off taken on a residential property. At September     30, 2016, management concluded that the balance in our allowance for loan losses appropriately reflected the probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio based on an analysis of the Bank s loss history and other current factors including market values and current economic conditions and trends.   
  Non-interest Income.   For the nine months ended September     30, 2016, non-interest income was $ 86,000  compared to $ 290,000  for the nine months ended September     30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the $ 175,000  net gain on the sale of repossessed assets for the nine months ended September     30, 2015. Fees for originating loans for other financial institutions decreased $ 21,000  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period.  
  Non-interest Expense.   For the nine months ended September     30, 2016, our non-interest expense  increased  $ 95,000  or  3.2%  compared to the prior year period. Professional fees  increased  $ 90,000  primarily due to the $ 51,000  increase for legal fees, $ 33,000  for tax and accounting related fees, and $ 9,000  for other consulting fees. Our other costs  increased  $ 135,000  primarily due to a one-time $ 40,000  operational loss that was below the insurance deductible which is not expected to be recovered, $ 31,000  for problem loan costs, a $ 15,000  provision for off balance sheet commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the $ 15,000  recovery the prior year period; and $ 9,000  related to the annual meeting. Our compensation and employee benefit costs  decreased  $ 172,000  or  11.8%  primarily due to staffing changes and salary adjustments that were implemented in 2015 and the beginning of 2016.   
  Income Tax.   We recorded immaterial amounts for income taxes for the nine months ended September     30, 2016 and 2015.

Analysis of Net Interest Income   
  Net interest income represents the difference between the income we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income also depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them.   
  The following table sets forth average balance sheets,  annualized   average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a  zero  yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income.   

( 2 )   

Other interest earning assets include certificates of deposit in other financial institutions and cash equivalents.

Rate/Volume Analysis   
  The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of Ben Franklin Financial, Inc. s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to (i)     changes attributable to changes in volume (i.e., changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate) and (ii)     changes attributable to rate (i.e., changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change  due  to volume and the change  due  to rate.  

Table of Contents  

Item      3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
  This item is not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company.   
    Item      4 . Controls and Procedures     
  We have adopted disclosure controls and procedures designed to facilitate our financial reporting. The disclosure controls currently consist of communications among the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and each department head to identify any transactions, events, trends, risks, or contingencies which may be material to our operations. Our disclosure controls also contain certain elements of our internal controls adopted in connection with applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as of the end of the period covered by this report and found them to be effective. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the Audit Committee also meet on a quarterly basis.   
  We maintain internal control over financial reporting. There have not been any significant changes in such internal control over financial reporting in the last quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
     PART II Other Information      
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings      
  At September 30, 2016 there were no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or the Bank is a party other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to their respective businesses.   
     Item 1A. Risk Factors      
  In addition to the other information contained in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the follow risk factor represents material updates and additions to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional risks not presently know to us, or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factor set forth below also is a cautionary statement identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us.   
   A new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted Accounting Standard Update 2016-13, which will be effective for Ben Franklin Financial, Inc. and Ben Franklin Bank of Illinois for our first quarter of 2020. This standard , often referred to as  CECL  (reflecting ac current expected credit loss model), will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of losses expected to be realized over the contractual lives of the loans. Under current U.S .GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses only when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date. The new standard will require us to collect and review increased types and amounts of data for us to determine the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses, and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds      
  On July 15, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,920 shares of its common stock at a price of $11.00 per share for a total of $21,120.  The shares purchased represent the distribution to terminated ESOP participants who exercised their put option under the ESOP plan document.  The Company then retired the shares which were returned to authorized but unissued common stock.  The price was determine by an appraisal as required by the ESOP plan document.
