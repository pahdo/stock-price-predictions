NOTE 1            ORGANIZATION 
    
  Readers of this Quarterly Report should refer to the Company s (as defined below) audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K (our "Annual Report") for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (Commission File No. 1-34948), as certain footnote disclosures which would substantially duplicate those contained in our Annual Report have been omitted from this Quarterly Report. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation (which include only normal recurring adjustments) have been included in this Quarterly Report. Capitalized terms used, but not defined in this Quarterly Report, have the same meanings as in our Annual Report. 
    
  General 
    
  General Growth Properties, Inc. ("GGP" or the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was organized in July 2010 and is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, referred to as a "REIT". In these notes, the terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to GGP and its subsidiaries. 
    
  GGP, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is an owner and operator of retail properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are the owner, either entirely or with joint venture partners, of   126   retail properties. 
    
  Substantially all of our business is conducted through GGP Operating Partnership, LP ("GGPOP"), GGP Nimbus, LP ("GGPN") and GGP Limited Partnership ("GGPLP", and together with GGPN and GGPOP, the "Operating Partnerships"), subsidiaries of GGP. The Operating Partnerships own an interest in the properties that are part of the consolidated financial statements of GGP. As of   September 30, 2016  , GGP held an approximate   99%   common equity ownership (without giving effect to the potential conversion of the Preferred Units and LTIP Units as defined below) of the Operating Partnerships, while the remaining   1%   is held by limited partners and certain previous contributors of properties to the Operating Partnerships or their predecessors. 
    
  GGPOP is the general partner of, and owns a   1.5%   equity interest in GGPN and GGPLP. GGPOP has common units of limited partnership ("Common Units"), which are redeemable for cash or, at our option, shares of GGP common stock. It also has preferred units of limited partnership interest ("Preferred Units"), of which, certain Preferred Units can be converted into Common Units and then redeemed for cash or, at our option, shares of GGP common stock (  Note 9  ). GGPOP has full value long term incentive plan units and appreciation only long term incentive plan units (collectively "LTIP Units"), which are redeemable for cash or, at our option, shares of GGP common stock (  Note 11  ). 
    
  In addition to holding ownership interests in various joint ventures, the Operating Partnerships generally conduct their operations through General Growth Management, Inc. ("GGMI"), General Growth Services, Inc. ("GGSI"), and GGP REIT Services, LLC ("GGPRS"). GGMI and GGSI are taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"s), which provide management, leasing, tenant coordination, business development, marketing, strategic partnership and other services for a majority of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates (defined below) and for substantially all of our Consolidated Properties, as defined below. GGSI also serves as a contractor to GGMI for these services. GGPRS generally provides financial, accounting, tax, legal, development, and other services to our Consolidated Properties. 
    
  We refer to our ownership interests in properties in which we own a majority or controlling interest and are consolidated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as the "Consolidated Properties." We also own interests in certain properties through joint venture entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest ("Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates") and we refer to those properties as the "Unconsolidated Properties." 

NOTE 2        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GGP, our subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest. For consolidated joint ventures, the noncontrolling partner s share of the assets, liabilities and operations of the joint ventures (generally computed as the joint venture partner s ownership percentage) is included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate affiliates as permanent equity of the Company. Intercompany balances and

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 

transactions have been eliminated. Noncontrolling interests are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the Common, Preferred, and LTIP Units of GGPOP and are presented either as redeemable noncontrolling interests or as noncontrolling interests in our permanent equity. E  ach of the Operating Partnerships are variable interest entities as the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. However, as the Company holds a majority voting interest in the Operating Partnerships, it qualifies for the exemption from providing certain of the disclosure requirements associated with variable interest entities. 
    
  We operate in a single reportable segment, which includes the operation, development and management of retail and other rental properties. Our portfolio is targeted to a range of market sizes and consumer tastes. Each of our operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. The Company's chief operating decision maker is comprised of a team of several members of executive management who use Company NOI in assessing segment operating performance. We do not distinguish or group our consolidated operations based on geography, size or type for purposes of making property operating decisions. Our operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to our tenants. There are no individual operating segments that are greater than   10%   of combined revenue, Company NOI or combined assets. Further, all material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than   10%   of consolidated revenues. As a result, the Company s operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment. 
    
  Properties 
    
  Real estate assets are stated at cost less any provisions for impairments. Expenditures for significant betterments and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. Construction and improvement costs incurred in connection with the development of new properties or the redevelopment of existing properties are capitalized. Real estate taxes, interest costs, and internal costs associated with leasing and development overhead incurred during construction periods are capitalized. Capitalization is based on qualified expenditures and interest rates. Capitalized real estate taxes, interest costs, and internal costs associated with leasing and development overhead are amortized over lives which are consistent with the related assets. 
    
  Pre-development costs, which generally include legal and professional fees and other third-party costs directly related to the construction assets, are capitalized as part of the property being developed. In the event a development is no longer deemed to be probable of occurring, the capitalized costs are expensed (see also our impairment policies in this note below). 
    
  We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our properties, and may adjust them as necessary. The estimated useful lives of our properties range from   10   -   45   years. 
    
  Depreciation or amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: 
                   
    Years 
      Buildings and improvements 
    10 - 45 
      Equipment and fixtures 
    3 - 20 
      Tenant improvements 
    Shorter of useful life or applicable lease term 

Acquisitions of Operating Properties (  Note 3  ) 
    
  Acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired properties have been included in the results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition. Estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques are used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land, buildings and improvements, equipment, assumed debt liabilities and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in-place tenant leases, acquired above and below-market tenant and ground leases, and tenant relationships. 
    
  Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities are calculated for above-market and below-market tenant and ground leases where we are either the lessor or the lessee. The difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases, including significantly below-market renewal options for which exercise of the renewal option appears to be reasonably assured. The remaining term of leases with renewal

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 

options at terms significantly below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options and assume the amortization period would coincide with the extended lease term. 
    
  The gross asset balances of the in-place value of tenant leases are included in buildings and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The above-market tenant leases and below-market ground leases are included in prepaid expenses and other assets (  Note 13  ). The below-market tenant leases, above-market ground leases and above-market headquarters office lease are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses (  Note 14  ) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Amortization/accretion of all intangibles, including the intangibles in   Note 13   and   Note 14  , had the following effects on our Income from continuing operations:    

Future amortization/accretion of all intangibles, including the intangibles in   Note 13   and   Note 14  , is estimated to decrease results from continuing operations as follows: 

Marketable Securities 
    
  Marketable securities are comprised of equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are presented in prepaid expenses and other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are included in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings only upon the sale of the securities and are recorded based on the weighted average cost of such securities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized gains of   $13.1 million   in management fees and other corporate revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income from the sale of Seritage Growth Properties stock. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates (  Note 5  ) 
  We account for investments in joint ventures where we own a non-controlling joint interest using either the equity method or the cost method. If we have significant influence but not control over the the investment, we utilize the equity method. If we have neither control nor significant influence, we utilize the cost method. Under the equity method, the cost of our investment is adjusted for our share of the earnings of such Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates from the date of acquisition, increased by our contributions

  (Unaudited) 

and reduced by distributions received. Under the cost method, the cost of our investment is not adjusted for our share of the earnings of such Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates from the date of acquisition and distributions are treated as earnings when received. 
  To determine the method of accounting for partially owned joint ventures, we evaluate the characteristics of associated entities and determine whether an entity is a variable interest entity ("VIE"). A limited partnership or other similar entity is considered a VIE unless a simple majority of limited partners (excluding limited partners that are under common control with the general partner) have substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. If an entity is determined to be a VIE, we determine which party is the primary beneficiary by analyzing whether we have both the power to direct the entity's significant economic activities and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or receive potentially significant benefits. Significant judgments and assumptions inherent in this analysis include the nature of the entity's operations, future cash flow projections, the entity's financing and capital structure, and contractual relationship and terms. We consolidate a VIE when we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. 
  Primary risks associated with our VIEs include the potential of funding the entities' debt obligations or making additional contributions to fund the entities' operations. 
  Generally, the operating agreements with respect to our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates provide that assets, liabilities and funding obligations are shared in accordance with our ownership percentages. Therefore, we generally also share in the profit and losses, cash flows and other matters relating to our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in accordance with our respective ownership percentages. Except for Retained Debt (as described in   Note 5  ), differences between the carrying amount of our investment in the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates and our share of the underlying equity of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates are typically amortized over lives ranging from   5   to   45   years. When cumulative distributions exceed our investment in the joint venture, the investment is reported as a liability in our consolidated financial statements. The liability is limited to our maximum potential obligation to fund contractual obligations, including recourse related to certain debt obligations. 
  Partially owned, non-variable interest joint ventures over which we have controlling financial interest are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. In determining if we have a controlling financial interest, we consider factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions, kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. Partially owned joint ventures where we do not have a controlling financial interest, but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. 
  To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture accounted for using the equity method, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. We will recognize gains and losses on the contribution of our real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner s interest, to the extent the buyer is independent of the Company, the collection of the sales price is reasonably assured, and we will not be required to support the operations of the property or its related obligations to an extent greater than our proportionate interest. 
  The combined summarized financial information of unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in   Note 5   to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We continually analyze and assess reconsideration events, including changes in the factors mentioned above, to determine if the consolidation treatment remains appropriate. Decisions regarding consolidation of partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment by our management. 
  Revenue Recognition and Related Matters 
    
  Minimum rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related operating leases, including the effect of any free rent periods. Minimum rents also include lease termination income collected from tenants to allow for the tenant to vacate their space prior to their scheduled termination dates, as well as, accretion related to above-market and below-market tenant leases on acquired properties and properties that were recorded at fair value at the emergence from bankruptcy. 
  Overage rent is paid by a tenant when the tenant's sales exceed an agreed upon minimum amount and is recognized on an accrual basis once tenant sales exceed contractual tenant lease thresholds and is calculated by multiplying the sales in excess of the minimum amount by a percentage defined in the lease. 
  Tenant recoveries are established in the leases or computed based upon a formula related to real estate taxes, insurance and other property operating expenses and are generally recognized as revenues in the period the related costs are incurred.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 

Real estate sales are recognized whenever (1) a sale is consummated, (2) the buyer has demonstrated an adequate commitment to pay for the property, (3) the Company s receivable is not subject to future subordination, and (4) the Company has transferred to the buyer the risks and rewards of ownership and does not have continuing involvement. Unless all conditions are met, recognition of all or a portion of the profit shall be postponed. 
  We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, which is estimated to be uncollectible. Such allowances are reviewed periodically based upon our recovery experience. 
    
  Management Fees and Other Corporate Revenues 
    
  Management fees and other corporate revenues primarily represent management and leasing fees, development fees, financing fees and fees for other ancillary services performed for the benefit of certain of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. Management fees are reported at   100%   of the revenue earned from the joint venture in management fees and other corporate revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Our share of the management fee expense incurred by the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates is reported within equity in income of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in property management and other costs in the Condensed Combined Statements of Income in   Note 5  . The following table summarizes the management fees from affiliates and our share of the management fee expense: 

(1) Excludes a   $13.1 million   gain recognized in management fees and other corporate revenues on the divestiture of our investment in Seritage Growth Properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Impairment 
    
  Operating properties 
    
  We regularly review our consolidated properties for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators are assessed separately for each property and include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in real estate property net operating income, significant decreases in occupancy percentage, debt maturities and management s intent with respect to the properties and prevailing market conditions. 
    
  If an indicator of potential impairment exists, the property is tested for recoverability by comparing its carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Although the carrying amount may exceed the estimated fair value of certain properties, a real estate asset is only considered to be impaired when its carrying amount cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To the extent an impairment provision is determined to be necessary, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is expensed to operations. In addition, the impairment provision is allocated proportionately to adjust the carrying amount of the asset group. The adjusted carrying amount, which represents the new cost basis of the property, is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the property. 
    
  Although we may market a property for sale, there can be no assurance that the transaction will occur until the sale is finalized. However, GAAP requires us to utilize the Company s expected holding period of our properties when assessing recoverability. If we cannot recover the carrying value of these properties within the planned holding period, we will estimate the fair values of the assets and record impairment charges for properties when the estimated fair value is less than their carrying value. 
    
  Impairment indicators for pre-development costs, which are typically costs incurred during the beginning stages of a potential development and construction in progress, are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the Company s plans with respect to the project, significant changes in projected completion dates, tenant demand, anticipated revenues or cash flows, development costs, market factors and sustainability of development projects.

  GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC. 
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
  (Unaudited) 

Impairment charges are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income when the carrying value of a property is not recoverable and it exceeds the estimated fair value of the property, which can occur in accounting periods preceding disposition and/or in the period of disposition.  
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   $73.0 million   impairment charge (of which   $28.3 million   relates to the   three months ended September 30, 2016  ) on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income related to   three   operating properties. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received bona fide purchase offers for   two   properties which were less than their respective carrying values. The other property had non-recourse debt maturing during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that exceeded the fair value of the operating property. This property was transferred to a special servicer during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   No   provisions for impairment were recognized for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of our properties could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future impairment if assumptions regarding those properties differ from actual results. 
    
  Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates 
    
  A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value of our investment in an Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliate has occurred. The investment in each of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates is evaluated for valuation declines below the carrying amount. Accordingly, in addition to the property-specific impairment analysis that we perform for such joint ventures (as part of our operating property impairment process described above), we also considered whether there were other-than-temporary declines with respect to the carrying values of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates.   No   impairments related to our investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates were recognized for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of our investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future impairment if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements (  Note 4  ) 
    
  The accounting principles for fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: 

Level 1 - defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 
                
    Level 2 - defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
                
    Level 3 - defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
       
  Note 4   includes a discussion of properties measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs and the fair value of debt, which is estimated on a recurring basis using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.   Note 4   also includes a discussion of available-for-sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs.   Note 9   includes a discussion of certain redeemable noncontrolling interests that are measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. 
    
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
    
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. Our credit risk exposure with regard to our cash and the   $1.5 billion  , including the accordion, available under our credit facility is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. We had   no   outstanding balance and   $315.0 million   outstanding under our credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update that required us to evaluate whether we should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments: (i) modified the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminated the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affected the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provided a scope exception for certain entities. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, companies are required to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability (excluding 
  revolving credit facility) as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs will not be affected. We elected to early adopt this pronouncement as of December 31, 2015 which resulted in the reclassification of unamortized capitalized loan fees from deferred expenses to a direct reduction of the Company s indebtedness on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Effective January 1, 2018, companies will be required to apply a five-step model in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of the revenue model is that a company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Lease contracts will be excluded from this revenue recognition criteria; however, the sale of real estate will be required to follow the new model. Expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding revenue recognition will be required for contracts that are subject to this pronouncement. The new standard can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02 which will require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07 which eliminates the requirement for retrospective application of equity method accounting when an investment previously accounted for by another method initially qualifies for the equity method. This standard is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 which changes the model for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. Specifically, the amendments in the ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments in this ASU will be effective January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 which   provides guidance on the statement of cash flows presentation of certain transactions where diversity in practice exists. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted. The ASU should be adopted using a retrospective transition approach. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this pronouncement on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. For example, estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to fair values of assets and liabilities for purposes of applying the acquisition

Actual results could differ from these and other estimates.

$118.5 million   upon completion of the redevelopment and expansion. As a result, our joint venture partners own a combined   37.5%   economic interest in the joint venture. 
    
  Upon sale of the   25%   interest in Ala Moana Center and in accordance with applicable accounting standards for real estate sales with future development required, we recognized a   $584.4 million   gain on change in control of investment properties and other as of the closing date calculated on the percentage of the basis (real estate asset carrying value of Ala Moana Center and development costs incurred to date) as compared to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred through completion of the development.

  We account for the   62.5%   interest in the joint venture that owns Ala Moana Center under the equity method of accounting (  Note 5  ) because we share control over major decisions with the joint venture partners which resulted in the partners obtaining substantive participating rights.

NOTE 4            FAIR VALUE 
    
  Nonrecurring Fair Value of Operating Properties 
    
  We estimate fair value relating to impairment assessments based upon discounted cash flow and direct capitalization models that include all projected cash inflows and outflows over a specific holding period, or the negotiated sales price, if applicable. Such projected cash flows are comprised of contractual rental revenues and forecasted rental revenues and expenses based upon market conditions and expectations for growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are based on a reasonable range of current market rates for each property analyzed. Based upon these inputs, we determined that our valuations of properties using a discounted cash flow or a direct capitalization model were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For our properties for which the estimated fair value was based on negotiated sales prices, we determined that our valuation was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The fair values of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amount in our consolidated financial statements except for debt. Management s estimates of fair value are presented below for our debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1) Includes market rate adjustments of   $28.9 million   and   $33.0 million   and deferred financing costs of   $43.0 million   and   $40.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of our Junior Subordinated Notes approximates their carrying amount as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . We estimated the fair value of mortgages, notes and other loans payable using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs based on recent financing transactions, estimates of the fair value of the property that serves as collateral for such debt, historical risk premiums for loans of comparable quality, current   LIBOR  , U.S. treasury obligation interest rates and on the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt. The discount rates estimated reflect our judgment as to what the approximate current lending rates for loans or groups of loans with similar maturities and assume that the debt is outstanding through maturity. We have utilized market information as available or present value techniques to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions and do not acknowledge transfer or

other repayment restrictions that may exist in specific loans, it is unlikely that the estimated fair value of any such debt could be realized by immediate settlement of the obligation. 
    
  Recurring Fair Value of Marketable Securities 
    
  Marketable securities are measured at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets using Level 1 inputs and included in Prepaid expenses and other assets. The fair values are shown below. 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   we divested the entire investment in Seritage Growth Properties, recognized a gain of   $13.1 million   in management fees and other corporate revenues, and reclassified   $12.0 million   out of other comprehensive income (loss).

  The Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates represents our investments in real estate joint ventures that are not consolidated. We hold interests in   26   domestic joint ventures, comprising   42   U.S. retail properties and   one   joint venture in Brazil. Generally, we share in the profits and losses, cash flows and other matters relating to our investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in accordance with our respective ownership percentages. We manage most of the properties owned by these joint ventures. We account for investments in joint ventures where we own a non-controlling joint interest using either the equity method or the cost method. If we have significant influence but not control over the the investment, we utilize the equity method. If we have neither control or significant influence, we utilize the cost method.

In accordance with GAAP, sales of condominiums have been recognized using the percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenue is recognized when (1) construction is beyond a preliminary stage, (2) buyers are unable to receive refunds of down-payments except in the event of non-delivery, (3) a substantial percentage of the condominiums are under firm contracts, (4) collection of the sales price is reasonably assured and (5) sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated. The revenue from condominium sales is calculated based on the percentage of completion, as determined by the construction contract costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated construction costs. 
    
  On March 24, 2016, Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, Ohio (property included in a joint venture of which we are   50%   owner) acquired fee title to a portion of the property previously held under ground lease for a gross purchase price of   $43.0 million  . 
    
  Unconsolidated Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, and Retained Debt 
    
  Our proportionate share of the mortgages, notes and loans payable of the unconsolidated joint ventures was   $5.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $5.1 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  , including Retained Debt (as defined below). There can be no assurance that the Unconsolidated Properties will be able to refinance or restructure such debt on acceptable terms or otherwise, or that joint venture operations or contributions by us and/or our partners will be sufficient to repay such loans. 
    
  We have debt obligations in excess of our pro rata share of the debt for   one   of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates ("Retained Debt"). This Retained Debt represents distributed debt proceeds of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in excess of our pro rata share of the non-recourse mortgage indebtedness. The proceeds of the Retained Debt which were distributed to us are included as a reduction in our investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. We had retained debt of   $86.8 million   at   one   property as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $87.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . We are obligated to contribute funds on an ongoing basis, as needed, to our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in amounts sufficient to pay debt service on such Retained Debt. If we do not contribute such funds, our distributions from such Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates, or our interest in, could be reduced to the extent of such deficiencies. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not anticipate an inability to perform on our obligations with respect to Retained Debt. 

NOTE 6            MORTGAGES, NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE 
    
  Mortgages, notes and loans payable and the weighted-average interest rates are summarized as follows: 

(1) Includes   $28.9 million   of market rate adjustments and   $43.0 million   of deferred financing costs.

Certain of these consolidated secured loans, representing   $1.4 billion   of debt, are cross-collateralized with other properties. Although a majority of the   $12.5 billion   of fixed and variable rate collateralized mortgages, notes and loans payable are non-recourse,   $819.0 million   of such mortgages, notes and loans payable are recourse to the Company as guarantees on secured financings. In addition, certain mortgage loans contain other credit enhancement provisions which have been provided by GGP. Certain mortgages, notes and loans payable may be prepaid but are generally subject to a prepayment penalty equal to a yield-maintenance premium, defeasance or a percentage of the loan balance. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid down   $294.4 million   of consolidated mortgage notes at   two   properties. The prior loans had a weighted-average term-to-maturity of   1.2 years   and a weighted-average interest rate of   5.3%  . In conjunction with the pay down of the loans, we paid   $5.4 million   in transaction costs. 
    
  On April 25, 2016, we amended our   $1.4 billion   loan secured by cross-collateralized mortgages on   15   properties. The interest rate remained consistent at LIBOR plus   1.75%  , however, we were able to decrease the recourse from   100%   to   50%   and extend the term for   three years  . The loan now matures April 25, 2019, with   two     one year   extension options. 
    
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we refinanced consolidated mortgage notes totaling   $710.0 million   at   four   properties and generated net proceeds of   $240.9 million  . The prior loans totaling   $469.1 million   had a weighted-average term-to-maturity of   1.3 years  , and a weighted-average interest rate of   5.6%  . The new loans have a weighted-average term-to-maturity of   10.0 years  ,and a weighted-average interest rate of   3.8%  . In addition, we paid down   $594.3 million   of consolidated mortgage notes at   five   properties. The prior loans had a weighted-average term-to-maturity of   1.5 years   and a weighted-average interest rate of   5.3%  . We also obtained new mortgage notes totaling   $250.0 million   on   two   properties with a weighted-average term-to-maturity of   10.0 years   and a weighted-average interest rate of   4.3%  .  
    
  Corporate and Other Unsecured Loans 
    
  We have certain unsecured debt obligations, the terms of which are described below: 

(1) Excludes deferred financing costs of   $9.3 million   in   2016   that decrease the total amount that appears outstanding in our 
  Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  (2) Excludes deferred financing costs of   $11.2 million   in   2015   that decrease the total amount that appears outstanding in our 
  Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Our revolving credit facility (the "Facility") as amended on October 30, 2015, provides for revolving loans of up to   $1.1 billion  . The Facility has an uncommitted accordion feature for a total facility of up to   $1.5 billion  . The Facility is scheduled to mature in October 2020 and is unsecured. Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus   130   to   190   basis points or at a base rate plus   30   to   90   basis points, which is determined by the Company s leverage level. The Facility contains certain restrictive covenants which limit material changes in the nature of our business conducted, including, but not limited to, mergers, dissolutions or liquidations, dispositions of assets, liens, incurrence of additional indebtedness, dividends, transactions with affiliates, prepayment of subordinated debt, negative pledges and changes in fiscal periods. In addition, we are required not to exceed a maximum net debt-to-value ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum net cash interest coverage ratio; we are not aware of any instances of non-compliance with such covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amount was outstanding on the Facility.

Junior Subordinated Notes 
    
  GGP Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of GGPN, completed a private placement of   $200.0 million   of trust preferred securities ("TRUPS") in 2006. The Trust also issued   $6.2 million   of Common Securities to GGPOP. The Trust used the proceeds from the sale of the TRUPS and Common Securities to purchase   $206.2 million   of floating rate Junior subordinated notes of GGPOP due 2036. Distributions on the TRUPS are equal to   LIBOR   plus   1.45%  . Distributions are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance. The TRUPS mature on April 30, 2036, but may be redeemed beginning on April 30, 2011 if the Trust exercises its right to redeem a like amount of Junior subordinated notes. The Junior subordinated notes bear interest at LIBOR plus   1.45%   and are fully recourse to the Company. Though the Trust currently is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GGPN, we are not the primary beneficiary of the Trust and, accordingly, it is not consolidated for accounting purposes. We have recorded the Junior subordinated notes as a liability and our common equity interest in the Trust as prepaid expenses and other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds 
    
  We had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of   $52.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $76.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . These letters of credit and bonds were issued primarily in connection with insurance requirements, special real estate assessments and construction obligations. 
    
  We are not aware of any instances of non-compliance with our financial covenants related to our mortgages, notes and loans payable as of   September 30, 2016  , with the exception of   one   mortgage loan. A special servicer is currently managing the operations of the property securing the mortgage loan. 

NOTE 7            INCOME TAXES 
    
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to maintain REIT status. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least   90%   of our taxable ordinary income. In addition, the Company is required to meet certain asset and income tests. 
    
  As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to corporate level Federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to Federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for   four   subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income or property, and to Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income and capital gains. We are currently statutorily open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended December 31,   2013   through   2015   and are statutorily open to audit by state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31,   2012   through   2015  . 
    
  We have no unrecognized tax benefits recorded pursuant to uncertain tax positions as of   September 30, 2016  . 

NOTE 8            WARRANTS 
    
  Brookfield and certain parties who were previously members of a Brookfield investor consortium own   73,930,000   warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase common stock of GGP with an initial weighted average exercise price of   $10.70  . Each Warrant was fully vested upon issuance, has a term of   seven   years and expires on November 9, 2017. Below is a summary of Warrants that were originally issued and are still outstanding. 

The exercise prices of the Warrants are subject to adjustment for future dividends, stock dividends, distribution of assets, stock splits or reverse splits of our common stock or certain other events. In accordance with the agreement, these calculations adjust

both the exercise price and the number of shares issuable for the originally issued   73,930,000   Warrants. During   2015   and   2016  , the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the outstanding Warrants changed as follows: 

The warrant holders have the option for   57,500,000   Warrants to either full share settle (i.e. deliver cash for the exercise price of the Warrants in the amount of approximately   $618 million   in exchange for approximately   71 million   shares of common stock) or net share settle. The remaining   16,430,000   Warrants must be net share settled. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Warrants are exercisable into approximately   62 million   common shares of the Company, at a weighted-average exercise price of approximately   $8.70   per share. Due to their ownership of Warrants, Brookfield s potential ownership of the Company may change as a result of payments of dividends and changes in our stock price. 

NOTE 9            EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
    
  Allocation to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Noncontrolling interests consists of the redeemable interests related to GGPOP Common, Preferred and LTIP Units and the noncontrolling interest in our consolidated joint ventures. The following table reflects the activity included in the allocation to noncontrolling interests. 

Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  The noncontrolling interest related to the Common, Preferred, and LTIP Units of GGPOP are presented either as redeemable noncontrolling interests or as noncontrolling interests in our permanent equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Classification as redeemable or permanent equity is considered on a tranche-by-tranche basis and is dependent on whether we could be required, under certain events outside of our control, to redeem the securities for cash by the holders of the securities. Those tranches for which we could be required to redeem the security for cash are included in redeemable equity. If we control the decision to redeem the securities for cash, the securities are classified as permanent equity.

  (Unaudited) 

The Common and Preferred Units of GGPOP are recorded at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest s share of the allocation of income or loss (and its share of other comprehensive income or loss) and dividends or their redemption value (i.e. fair value) as of each measurement date. The excess of the fair value over the carrying amount from period to period is recorded within additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Allocation to noncontrolling interests is presented as an adjustment to net income to arrive at Net income (loss) attributable to General Growth Properties, Inc. 
    
  The common redeemable noncontrolling interests have been recorded at fair value for all periods presented.   One   tranche of preferred redeemable noncontrolling interests has been recorded at fair value, while the other tranches of preferred redeemable noncontrolling interests have been recorded at carrying value. 
    
  Generally, the holders of the Common Units share in any distributions by GGPOP with our common stockholders. However, the GGPOP operating partnership agreement permits distributions solely to GGP if such distributions were required to allow GGP to comply with the REIT distribution requirements or to avoid the imposition of excise tax. Under certain circumstances, the conversion rate for each Common Unit is required to be adjusted to give effect to stock distributions. If the holders had requested redemption of the Common and Preferred Units as of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate amount of cash we would have paid would have been   $131.6 million   and   $159.3 million  , respectively. 
    
  GGPOP issued Preferred Units that are convertible into Common Units of GGPOP at the rates below (subject to adjustment). The holder may convert the Preferred Units into Common Units of GGPOP at any time, subject to certain restrictions. The Common Units are convertible into common stock at approximately a   one  -to-  one   ratio at the current stock price. 

(1) The conversion price of Series B preferred units is lower than the GGP   September 30, 2016   closing common stock price of   $27.60  ; therefore, the   September 30, 2016   common stock price of   $27.60  , and an additional conversion rate of   1.0397624   shares is used to calculate the Series B redemption value.

Common Stock Dividend 
    
  Our Board of Directors declared common stock dividends during   2016   and   2015   as follows: 

Our Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP") provides eligible holders of GGP s common stock with a convenient method of increasing their investment in the Company by reinvesting all or a portion of cash dividends in additional shares of common stock. Eligible stockholders who enroll in the DRIP on or before the   four  th business day preceding the record date for a dividend payment will be able to have that dividend reinvested. As a result of the DRIP elections,   20,759   shares were issued during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   17,658   shares were issued during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Common Stock Purchase 
    
  In June 2015, we entered into transactions to purchase   650,000   shares of our common stock on multiple exchanges through the open market at a weighted average price of   $26.00   per share. During the   three months ended September 30, 2015   we entered into transactions to purchase an additional   3,403,620   shares of our common stock on multiple exchanges through the open market at a weighted average price of   $25.24   per share. In total, we acquired   4,053,620   shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of   $102.8 million   plus commissions. With the exception of   89,945   shares purchased for   $24.86   per share, these shares were retired in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   89,945   shares were part of our treasury stock as of   September 30, 2015  . During October 2015 we retired the remaining   89,945   shares. 
    
  Preferred Stock 
    
  On February 13, 2013, we issued, in a public offering,   10,000,000   shares of   6.375%   Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") at a price of   $25.00   per share, resulting in net proceeds of   $242.0 million   after issuance costs. The Preferred Stock is recorded net of issuance costs within equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accrues a quarterly dividend at an annual rate of   6.375%  . The dividend is paid in arrears in preference to dividends on our common stock, and reduces net income available to common stockholders, and therefore, earnings per share. 
    
  The Preferred Stock does not have a stated maturity date but we may redeem the Preferred Stock after February 12, 2018, for   $25.00   per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. We may redeem the Preferred Stock prior to February 12, 2018, in limited circumstances that preserve ownership limits and/or our status as a REIT, as well as during certain circumstances surrounding a change of control. Upon certain circumstances surrounding a change of control, holders of Preferred Stock may elect to convert each share of their Preferred Stock into a number of shares of GGP common stock equivalent to   $25.00   plus accrued and unpaid dividends, but not to exceed a cap of   2.4679   common shares (subject to certain adjustments related to GGP common share splits, subdivisions, or combinations).

NOTE 10        EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed after adjusting the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation for the effects of all potentially dilutive common shares. The dilutive effect of the Warrants and the dilutive effect of options and their equivalents (including fixed awards and nonvested stock issued under stock-based compensation plans), are computed using the "treasury" method. 
    
  Information related to our EPS calculations is summarized as follows: 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , dilutive options and dilutive shares related to the Warrants are included in the denominator of EPS. 
    
  Outstanding Common Units and LTIP Units have also been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because including such units would also require that the share of GGPOP income attributable to such units be added back to net income therefore resulting in no effect on EPS. Outstanding Preferred Units have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for all periods presented because including the Preferred Units would also require that the Preferred Units dividend be added back to the net income, resulting in anti-dilution. 
    
  GGP owned   55,969,390   and   56,059,335   shares of treasury stock as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These shares are presented as common stock in treasury, at cost, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, these shares have been excluded from the calculation of EPS.

NOTE 11        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS 
    
  The General Growth Properties, Inc. 2010 Equity Plan (the   Equity Plan  ) reserved for issuance of   4%   of outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. The Equity Plan provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-based awards and performance-based compensation (collectively, the   Awards  ). Directors, officers and other employees of GGP s and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible for the Awards. The Equity Plan is not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. No participant may be granted more than   4,000,000   shares, or the equivalent dollar value of such shares, in any year. Options granted under the Equity Plan will be designated as either nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options. An option granted as an incentive stock option will, to the extent it fails to qualify as an incentive stock option, be treated as a nonqualified option. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair value of a share of GGP s common stock on the date of grant. The term of each option will be determined prior to the date of grant, but may not exceed   10 years  . 
    
  On November 12, 2014, the Company s Equity Plan was amended to allow for the grant of LTIP Units to certain officers, directors, and employees of the Company as an alternative to the Company s stock options or restricted stock. LTIP Units are classes of partnership interests that under certain conditions, including vesting, are convertible by the holder into common units, which are redeemable by the holder for common shares on a one-to-one ratio (subject to adjustment for changes to GGP s capital structure) or for the cash value of such shares at the option of the Company. 
    
  On February 17, 2016, the Company s Equity Plan was amended to allow for the grant of restricted stock or LTIP Units to certain officers, directors, and employees of the Company that vest based on the achievement of certain established metrics that are based on the performance of the Company. 
    
  Compensation expense related to stock-based compensation plans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015   is summarized in the following table in thousands:

NOTE 12        ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, NET 
    
  The following table summarizes the significant components of Accounts and notes receivable, net. 

On November 11, 2015, we entered into a promissory note with our joint venture partner, Ashkenazy Holding Co., LLC ("AHC"), in which we lent   $57.6 million   that bears interest at   8%   per annum. The note is collateralized by AHC's equity in Miami Design District Associates, which is part of the AACMDD Group, LLC joint venture ("AACMDD"). We have an option through November 15, 2016 to purchase the collateral in exchange for cancellation of the note. If the option is exercised, the closing date will be on January 16, 2017 and all amounts previously paid by AHC must be repaid to AHC. 
  On September 17, 2015, we entered into a promissory note with our joint venture partner, AHC, in which we lent   $40.4 million   that bears interest at   6%   per annum. The note is collateralized by AHC's equity in Miami Design District Associates, which is part of AACMDD. We have an option whereby we can send notice up to   30 days   prior to the maturity date of September 17, 2017 to purchase the collateral in exchange for cancellation of the note. If the option is exercised, all amounts previously paid by AHC must be repaid to AHC. 
    
  On June 30, 2015, we entered into a promissory note with our joint venture partner MKB (defined in   Note 5  ), in which we would lend MKB up to   $80 million   for capital calls after an initial contribution of   $80 million   by MKB and until the joint venture secured construction financing. This loan bears interest at   LIBOR plus 6%   and is secured by MKB's partnership interest in AMX, which is constructing a luxury residential condominium tower on a site located within the Ala Moana Shopping Center. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $16.1 million   outstanding on this loan. Construction financing closed during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Notes receivable includes   $204.3 million   of notes receivables from our joint venture partners related to the acquisition of 730 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York. The first note was issued for   $104.3 million  , bears interest at   8.0%   compounded annually and matures on February 12, 2025. The second note was issued for   $100.0 million   to the joint venture partner acquiring the office portion of the property and bears interest at   9.0%   subject to terms and conditions in the loan agreement and matures on April 17, 2025. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $229.1 million   outstanding on these loans. 
    
  Also included in notes receivable is   $123.0 million   and   $50.1 million   due from our joint venture partner related to the acquisition of the properties at 685 Fifth Avenue and 530 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York. The notes receivable bear interest at   7.5%

and   9%   respectively. Interest is compounded quarterly with accrued but unpaid interest increasing the loan balance. The notes are collateralized by our partner's ownership interest in the joint ventures. The loans mature on June 27, 2024 and June 18, 2024, respectively.  
    
  On July 29, 2016, we settled a note receivable in the net amount of   $78.9 million   issued to Rique Empreendimentos e Participacoes Ltda. ("Rique") in exchange for approximately   18.3 million   shares in Aliansce Shopping Centers, S.A. ("Aliansce"), resulting in an   11.3%   ownership in Aliansce. On September 29, 2016, we sold the   18.3 million   shares in Aliansce to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for a sales price of   $84.9 million  . The note receivable was issued in conjunction with our sale of Aliansce to Rique and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board on September 30, 2013. The note receivable was denominated in Brazilian Reais, bore interest at an effective interest rate of approximately   14%  , was collateralized by shares of common stock in Aliansce, and required annual principal and interest payments over the term.   As the note receivable was a collateral dependent loan, we originally estimated the provision for loss based on the fair value of the market price of the Aliansce shares which served as the collateral for the loan. Upon the settlement of the note during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we decreased the provision for loan loss based on the final sales price.   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , w  e recognized a   $29.4 million   loss on the note recorded in the provision for loan loss on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on the value of the collateral and included accrued interest of   $7.5 million   in the provision for loan loss. We recognized the impact of changes in the exchange rate on the note receivable as gain or loss on foreign currency in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

NOTE 16        COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  We lease land or buildings at certain properties from third parties. The leases generally provide us with a right of first refusal in the event of a proposed sale of the property by the landlord. Rental payments are expensed as incurred and have been straight-lined over the term of the lease, to the extent applicable. The following is a summary of our contractual rental expense as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:

ITEM 2 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
       
  All references to numbered Notes are to specific footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report and whose descriptions are incorporated into the applicable response by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with such consolidated financial statements and related Notes. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") have the same meanings as in such Notes. 
    
  Overview  
    
  Our primary business is owning and operating best-in-class retail properties that provide an outstanding environment and experience for our communities, retailers, employees, consumers and shareholders. We are an S P 500 real estate company with a property portfolio comprised primarily of Class A malls (defined primarily by sales per square foot) and urban retail properties. Our retail properties are the core centers of retail, dining and entertainment within their trade areas and, therefore, represent hubs of such activity. As of   September 30, 2016  , we own, either entirely or with joint venture partners,   126   retail properties located throughout the United States comprising approximately   124 million   square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). 
    
  We provide management and other services to substantially all of our properties, including properties which we own through joint venture arrangements and which are unconsolidated for GAAP purposes. Our management operating philosophies and strategies are the same whether the properties are consolidated or unconsolidated. 
    
  We seek long-term growth in Company NOI and Company EBITDA (as defined below) through proactive management and leasing of our properties. We also recycle capital through strategic dispositions in order to opportunistically invest in high quality retail properties, as well as control operating expenses. We believe that the most significant operating factor affecting incremental cash flow and Company EBITDA growth is increased rents earned from tenants at our properties. This growth is primarily achieved by: 

positive leasing spreads; 
                
    higher occupancy; 
                
    income from redevelopment projects; and 
                
    managing operating expenses. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total leased space was   96.6%  . On a suite-to-suite basis, the leases commencing occupancy in the trailing 12 months exhibited initial rents that were   12.0%   higher than the final rents paid on expiring leases. 
    
  We have identified approximately   $1.0 billion   of income producing development and redevelopment projects within our portfolio, over 80% of which is being invested into Class A malls. We currently expect to achieve stabilized returns of approximately 7-9% for all projects. 
    
  We believe our long-term strategy can provide our shareholders with a competitive risk-adjusted total return comprised of dividends and share price appreciation.

Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  The following table is a breakout of the components of minimum rents:   

Base minimum rents decreased   $13.9 million   primarily due to our sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in $11.4 million less base minimum rents during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as the property is now accounted for as an Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliate. In addition, the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a $5.4 million decrease in base minimum rents. The offsetting increase in base minimum rents is primarily due to rents from new developments, an increase in permanent occupancy and an increase on contractual rent steps between   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Tenant recoveries decreased   $10.5 million   primarily due to our sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in $5.2 million less tenant recoveries during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as the property is now accounted for as an Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliate. In addition, the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a $2.1 million decrease in tenant recoveries. 
    
  Other revenue decreased   $10.3 million   primarily due to the sale of air rights at Ala Moana Center which resulted in a $12.5 million gain on sale for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Marketing costs decreased   $2.0 million   primarily due to operational efficiencies. 
    
  Other property operating costs decreased   $5.8 million   primarily due to our sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in $2.0 million less other property operating costs during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as the property is now accounted for as an Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliate. In addition, the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a $1.7 million decrease in other property operating costs. The remaining decrease is primarily due to operational efficiencies. 
    
  Recovery from loan loss of   $6.7 million   relates to the settlement of the Rique note receivable during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (  Note 12  ). 
    
  Provision for impairment of   $28.3 million   is related to an impairment charge recorded on one operating property during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (  Note 2  ). 
    
  Depreciation and amortization increased   $28.1 million   primarily due to the write-off of anchor buildings demolished at two operating properties during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Interest expense decreased   $3.6 million   primarily due to our sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in $5.8 million less interest expense during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   as the property is now accounted for as an Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliate. The offsetting increase in interest expense is primarily due to $2.6 million in mortgage interest on two operating properties that were unencumbered during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The gain on foreign currency is related to the impact of changes in the exchange rate on a note receivable denominated in Brazilian Reais and received in conjunction with the sale of Aliansce in the third quarter of 2013. The note receivable was settled during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (  Note 12  ).

The gain from changes in control of investment properties and other of   $620.3 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily relates to the sale of an interest in Fashion Show, the sale of our interests in two operating properties, and additional development related to our sale of a 25% interest in Ala Moana Center in   2015  . The gain from changes in control of investment properties and other of   $13.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015    relates to our sale of our interest in one operating property and additional development related to our sale of a 25% interest in Ala Moana Center in   2015   (  Note 3  ). 
    
  Benefit from income taxes of   $18.0 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily relates to the impact of changes in the exchange rate on the note receivable denominated in Reais and the reversal of liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. 
    
  Equity in income of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates increased by   $19.1 million   primarily due to income recognition on condominiums during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (  Note 5  ), the contribution of Fashion Show into an unconsolidated joint venture during the third quarter of 2016, and an increase in income related to the Crown Building located at 730 Fifth Avenue, which was acquired during the second quarter of 2015 (  Note 3  ). 
    
  Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   relates to additional development related to the sale of an additional 12.5% interest in Ala Moana Center during the second quarter of   2015   (  Note 3  ). Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates - gain on investment during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   relates to additional development related to the sale of an additional 12.5% interest in Ala Moana Center during the second quarter of   2015   and the sale of our interest in a joint venture during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   (  Note 3  ). 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  The following table is a breakout of the components of minimum rents:   

Base minimum rents decreased   $17.5 million   primarily due to the sale of an interest in Ala Moana Center during the first quarter of   2015   and the sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016.

The offsetting increase in base minimum rents is a result of rents from new developments, an increase in occupancy and an increase in contractual rent steps between   September 30, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Tenant recoveries decreased   $13.8 million   primarily due to the sale of an interest in Ala Moana Center during the first quarter of   2015   and the sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in $13.5 million less tenant recoveries during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as the properties are now accounted for as Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. In addition, the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a $6.1 million decrease in tenant recoveries. The offsetting increase in tenant recoveries is primarily due to higher real estate tax recoveries during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Management fees and other corporate revenues increased   $7.8 million   primarily due to the divestiture of our investment in Seritage Growth Properties which resulted in a   $13.1 million   gain in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (  Note 4  ). This was partially offset by a $6.0 million fee related to the residential condominium joint venture at Ala Moana Center during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Other revenue decreased   $5.4 million   primarily due to the sale of an interest in Ala Moana Center during the first quarter of   2015   and the sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in $1.2 million less other revenue during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as the properties are now

In addition, the sale of two operating properties during the first quarter of 2016 resulted in a $4.7 million decrease in other property operating costs. 
    
  Property management and other costs decreased   $15.1 million   primarily due to lower compensation and benefits as a result of the timing of the equity awards and the payment of bonuses. 
    
  Provision for loan loss of   $29.4 million   relates to the settlement of the Rique note receivable during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   (  Note 12  ).

  Interest and dividend income increased   $8.6 million   primarily due to interest on notes receivable from our joint venture partners at 730 Fifth Avenue. The loans were provided in connection with the acquisition of the property on April 17, 2015 (  Note 12  ). 
    
  Interest expense decreased   $23.0 million   primarily due to the sale of an interest in Ala Moana Center during the first quarter of   2015   and the sale of an interest in Fashion Show during the third quarter of 2016. This resulted in a decrease of $14.3 million in interest expense during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as the properties are now accounted for as Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates.

additional development related to the sale of an additional 12.5% interest in Ala Moana Center during the second quarter of   2015   (  Note 3  ). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our primary source of cash is from the ownership and management of our properties and strategic dispositions. We may also generate cash from refinancings or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses, debt service, reinvestment in and redevelopment of properties, tenant allowances, dividends and acquisitions. 
    
  We anticipate maintaining financial flexibility by managing our future maturities, amortization of debt, and minimizing cross collateralizations and corporate guarantees. We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of our commitments in the form of   $656.8 million   of consolidated unrestricted cash and   $1.1 billion   of available credit under our credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  , as well as anticipated cash provided by operations. 
    
  Our key financing objectives include: 

to obtain property-secured debt with laddered maturities; and 

to minimize the amount of debt that is cross-collateralized and/or recourse to us. 
       
  We may raise capital through public or private issuances of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, common units of the Operating Partnerships (as defined in   Note 1  ) or other capital raising activities. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid down   $294.4 million   of consolidated mortgage notes at   two   properties. The prior loans had a weighted-average term-to-maturity of   1.2 years   and a weighted-average interest rate of   5.3%  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.3 billion   of debt pre-payable at our proportionate share without penalty. We may pursue opportunities to refinance this debt at lower interest rates and longer maturities. 
    
  The amount of debt due in the next three years represents   4.4%   of our total debt at maturity. The maximum amount due in any one of the next ten years is no more than   $3.0 billion   at our proportionate share or approximately   17.4%   of our total debt at maturity. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our proportionate share of total debt aggregated   $18.6 billion  . Our total debt includes our consolidated debt of   $12.7 billion   and our share of Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates debt of   $5.9 billion  . Of our proportionate share of total debt,   $1.3 billion   is recourse to the Company or its subsidiaries (including the facility) due to guarantees or other security provisions for the benefit of the note holder. 
    
  The following table illustrates the scheduled payments for our proportionate share of total debt as of   September 30, 2016  . The   $206.2 million   of Junior Subordinated Notes are due in 2036, but we may redeem them any time after April 30, 2011 (  Note 6  ). As we do not expect to redeem the notes prior to maturity, they are included in the consolidated debt maturing subsequent to   2020  . 

We are working with the loan servicer on the loan which has matured in 2016. We also believe that the joint ventures will be able to refinance the debt of our Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates upon maturity; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or restructure such debt on acceptable terms or otherwise, or that joint venture operations or contributions by us and/or our partners will be sufficient to repay such loans.

Acquisitions and Joint Venture Activity 
    
  From time-to-time we may acquire whole or partial interests in high-quality retail properties and may sell assets. Refer to   Note 3    for more information. 
    
  Warrants and Brookfield Investor Ownership 
    
  Brookfield and certain parties who were previously members of a Brookfield investor consortium own all of the Company s outstanding Warrants (  Note 8  ) which are exercisable into approximately   62 million   common shares (assuming net share settlement) of the Company at a weighted-average exercise price of   $8.70   per share. The exercise price and common shares issuable under the Warrants adjusts for future dividends declared by the Company. 
    
  As of August 19, 2016, Brookfield s potential ownership of the Company (assuming full share settlement of the Warrants) was 34.6%, which is stated in their Form 13D filed on the same date. If Brookfield held or managed this same ownership through the maturity date of the Warrants, assuming: (a) GGP s common stock price increased $10 per share and (b) the Warrants were adjusted for the impact of regular dividends, we estimate that their ownership would be 35.8% under net share settlement, and 38.8% under full share settlement. 
    
  Redevelopments 
    
  We are currently redeveloping several consolidated and unconsolidated properties primarily to improve the productivity and value of the property, convert large-scale anchor boxes into smaller leasable areas and to create new in-line retail space and new restaurant venues. 
    
  We have development and redevelopment activities totaling approximately   $594 million   under construction and   $451 million   in the pipeline. We continue to evaluate a number of other redevelopment projects to further enhance the quality of our assets. Expected returns are based on the completion of current and future redevelopment projects, and the success of the leasing and asset management plans in place for each project. Expected returns are subject to a number of variables, risks, and uncertainties including those disclosed within Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (our "Annual Report"). We also refer the reader to our disclosure related to forward-looking statements, below. The following table illustrates our planned redevelopments: 

(1) Projected costs and investments to date exclude capitalized interest and overhead. 
  (2) Return on investment represents first year stabilized cash-on-cash return, based upon budgeted assumptions. Actual costs may vary.  
    
  Our investment in these projects for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   has increased from   December 31, 2015  , in conjunction with the applicable development plan and as projects near completion. The continued progression of 48 redevelopment projects resulted in increases to GGP s investment to date.

Capital Expenditures, Capitalized Interest and Overhead (at share) 
    
  The following table illustrates our capital expenditures, capitalized interest, and internal costs associated with leasing and development overhead, which primarily relate to ordinary capital projects at our operating properties. In addition, we incurred tenant allowances and capitalized leasing costs for our operating properties as outlined below. Capitalized interest is based upon qualified expenditures and interest rates; capitalized leasing and development costs are based upon time expended on these activities. These costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the related asset. 

Common Stock Dividends 
    
  Our Board of Directors declared common stock dividends during   2016   and   2015   as follows: 

Preferred Stock Dividends 
    
  On February 13, 2013, we issued, under a public offering, 10,000,000 shares of 6.375% Series A Cumulative Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Our Board of Directors declared preferred stock dividends during   2016   and   2015   as follows:

in   2016  , proceeds from the refinancing or issuance of mortgages, notes and loans payable, of   $663.5 million  ; net of principal payments of   ($1.5) billion  ; 
                 
    in   2015  , proceeds from the refinancing or issuance of mortgages, notes, and loans payable, of   $1.3 billion  ; net of principal payments of   ($1.6) billion  ; and 
        
  Seasonality 
    
  Although we have a year-long temporary leasing program, occupancies for short-term tenants and, therefore, rental income recognized, are higher during fourth quarter of the year. In addition, the majority of our tenants have December or January lease years for purposes of calculating annual overage rent amounts. Accordingly, overage rent thresholds are most commonly achieved in the fourth quarter. As a result, revenue production is generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures. Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  A disclosure of our critical accounting policies which affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements is included in our Annual Report in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

  REIT Requirements 
    
  In order to remain qualified as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable ordinary income to stockholders. We are also subject to Federal income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including capital gains. See   Note 7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on our ability to remain qualified as a REIT.

  Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures and Definitions 
    
  Proportionate or At Share Basis 
    
  The following Non-GAAP supplemental financial measures are all presented on a proportionate basis. The proportionate financial information presents the consolidated and unconsolidated properties at the Company s ownership percentage or  at share . This form of presentation offers insights into the financial performance and condition of the Company as a whole, given the significance of the Company s unconsolidated property operations that are owned through investments accounted for under GAAP using the equity method.  
    
  The proportionate financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP proportionate financial information reflects our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in our property portfolio that we do not wholly own. The amounts shown in the columns labeled "Consolidated Properties at Share" reflect the Company's Consolidated Properties at our proportionate share (excluding noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated properties). The amounts in the column labeled "Unconsolidated Properties" were derived on a property-by-property basis by including our share of each line item from each individual entity. This provides visibility into our share of the operations of our joint ventures. 
    
  We do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The operating agreements of the unconsolidated joint ventures generally provide that partners may receive cash distributions (1) to the extent there is available cash from operations, (2) upon a capital event, such as a refinancing or sale or (3) upon liquidation of the venture. The amount of cash each partner receives is based upon specific provisions of each operating agreement and varies depending on factors including the amount of capital contributed by each partner and whether any contributions are entitled to priority distributions. Upon liquidation of the joint venture and after all liabilities, priority distributions and initial equity contributions have been repaid, the partners generally would be entitled to any residual cash remaining based on their respective legal ownership percentages. 
    
  We provide Non-GAAP proportionate financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our unconsolidated joint ventures when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate their proportionate interest differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, the Non-GAAP proportionate financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  
    
  Net Operating Income ("NOI") and Company NOI 
    
  The Company defines NOI as proportionate income from operations and after operating expenses have been deducted, but prior to deducting financing, property management, administrative and income tax expenses. NOI excludes management fees and other corporate revenue and reductions in ownership as a result of sales or other transactions. The Company considers NOI a helpful supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual results of our properties. Because NOI excludes reductions in ownership as a result of sales or other transactions, management fees and other corporate revenue, general and administrative and property management expenses, interest expense, retail investment property impairment or non-recoverable development costs, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests, provision for income taxes, preferred stock dividends, and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

The Company also considers Company NOI to be a helpful supplemental measure of its operating performance because it excludes from NOI items such as straight-line rent, and amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisition accounting and other capital contribution or restructuring events. However, due to the exclusions noted, Company NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of the Company s financial performance.  
  We present Company NOI, Company EBITDA and Company FFO (as defined below); as we believe certain investors and other users of our financial information use these measures of the Company s historical operating performance. 
  Adjustments to NOI, EBITDA and FFO, including debt extinguishment costs, market rate adjustments on debt, straight-line rent, intangible asset and liability amortization, real estate tax stabilization, gains and losses on foreign currency and other items that are not a result of normal operations, assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at the properties or from other factors. In addition, the Company s leases include step rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate the Company for anticipated increases in market rentals over time. The Company s leases do not include significant front loading or back loading of payments or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. Management has historically made these adjustments in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs.  
  Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI and Company NOI, and accordingly, the Company s Company NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. 
    
  Earnings Before Interest Expense, Income Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA") and Company EBITDA 
    
  The Company defines EBITDA as NOI less certain property management and administrative expenses, net of management fees and other corporate revenues. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries, but may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other equity REITs, retail property owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses Company EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Same Store NOI (discussed below), it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs. Please see adjustments discussion above for the purpose and use of the adjustments included in Company EBITDA. 
  EBITDA and Company EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.  
    
  Funds From Operations ("FFO") and Company FFO 
    
  The Company determines FFO based upon the definition set forth by National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ). The Company determines FFO to be its share of consolidated net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding cumulative effects of accounting changes, excluding gains and losses from the sales of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon the Company s economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. As with the Company s presentation of NOI, FFO has been reflected on a proportionate basis. 
    
  The Company considers FFO a helpful supplemental measure of the operating performance for equity REITs and a complement to GAAP measures because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry. FFO facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of the Company s properties between periods because it does not give effect to real estate depreciation and amortization since these amounts are computed to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Since values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides investors with a clearer view of the Company s operating performance.  
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. As with the presentation of Company NOI and Company EBITDA, we also consider Company FFO, which is not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs, to be a  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

helpful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Please see adjustments discussion above for the purpose and use of the adjustments included in Company FFO. 
    
  FFO and Company FFO do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. In addition, Company FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders  benefit. 
    
  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The Company presents NOI, EBITDA and FFO as they are financial measures widely used in the REIT industry. In order to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the Company s non-GAAP financial measures of NOI, Company NOI, EBITDA, Company EBITDA, FFO and Company FFO, reconciliations have been provided as follows: a reconciliation of GAAP operating income to NOI and Company NOI, a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to GGP to EBITDA and Company EBITDA, and a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to GGP to FFO and Company FFO. None of the Company s non-GAAP financial measures represents cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, none should be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to GGP and none are necessarily indicative of cash flow. In addition, the Company has presented such financial measures on a consolidated and unconsolidated basis (at the Company s proportionate share) as the Company believes that given the significance of the Company s operations that are owned through investments accounted for by the equity method of accounting, the detail of the operations of the Company s unconsolidated properties provides important insights into the income and FFO produced by such investments.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statement are based on reasonable assumption, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the Company s ability to refinance, extend, restructure or repay near and intermediate term debt, its indebtedness, its ability to raise capital through equity issuances, asset sales or the incurrence of new debt, retail and credit market conditions, impairments, its liquidity demands and economic conditions. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company may update that discussion in its periodic reports, but otherwise takes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
