NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.   
       BASIS
    OF PRESENTATION     

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ATRM Holdings, Inc. and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. References in the notes
to the condensed consolidated financial statements to  ATRM,   the Company,   we,   us 
or  our , unless the context otherwise requires, refer to ATRM Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors. Our modular housing business is operated by our wholly-owned subsidiaries KBS Builders, Inc. and Maine Modular Haulers,
Inc. (collectively referred to as  KBS ).  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, has been derived from our audited financial statements. In the opinion
of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal,
recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results to be expected for the full year or any future period.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included
in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
Company is in the process of dissolving its subsidiary, Maine Modular Haulers, Inc. ( MMH ). MMH was used to provide
transportation, logistics and other related services for the transportation of KBS s completed modular buildings. In 2016,
the Company decided to outsource these services and has disposed of MMH s trucks and the frames (trailers) were sold to
KBS. KBS is coordinating the transportation and logistics and has outsourced the hauling of its completed modular buildings. The
Company expects MMH to be fully dissolved by December 31, 2016.  

2.   
       FINANCIAL
    POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

We
have incurred significant operating losses and, as of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $79 million.
There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue in the future to cover our expenses and achieve profitability
on a consistent basis or at all.  

We
issued various unsecured promissory notes to finance our acquisition of KBS in 2014 and to provide for our general working capital
needs since the acquisition (see Notes 11 and 12). On February 23, 2016, as described in Note 11, we entered into a loan and security
agreement with Gerber Finance Inc. ( Gerber Finance ) that provides KBS with a revolving line of credit with borrowing
availability of up to $4.0 million (the  KBS Loan Agreement ). As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding debt totaling
approximately $12.9 million. This debt included $2.8 million (net of deferred financing costs) owed under a line of credit with
Gerber Finance under the KBS Loan Agreement and approximately $1.0 million principal amount outstanding under an unsecured promissory
note issued to the primary seller of KBS. Our debt also includes $4.3 million principal amount outstanding under a promissory
note issued to Lone Star Value Investors, LP ( LSVI ) and $4.8 million principal amount outstanding under promissory
notes issued to Lone Star Value Co-Invest I, LP ( LSV Co-Invest I ). Interest on these notes is payable semiannually
and any unpaid principal and interest is due on April 1, 2019.  

On
August 12, 2016, the Company, LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I amended the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes allowing the Company,
at its sole option, to elect to make any interest payment in paid in kind interest ( PIK Interest ) at an annual rate
of 12% (versus the 10% interest rate applied to cash payments) for that period. The Company elected the PIK Interest option for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. Accordingly, interest for the six months ended June 30, 2016, totaling $534,000 (calculated
at the PIK Interest rate of 12%), was added to the balance of the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes.  

Jeffrey
E. Eberwein, our Chairman of the Board, is the manager of Lone Star Value Investors GP, LLC ( LSVGP ), the general
partner of LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I, and sole member of Lone Star Value Management, LLC ( LSVM ), the investment manager
of LSVI.  

We
intend to pursue new financing at the parent company level to replace all or a portion of the debt owing to LSVI and LSV Co-Invest
I and to provide for our general working capital needs. There can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such financing
on terms favorable to us or at all. Until such time as we obtain additional financing, ATRM may be dependent on LSVI and LSV Co-Invest
I, or other third parties, to provide for our general working capital needs. Although not a binding commitment, LSVM has advised
us of its present intention to continue to financially support the Company as we pursue new financing.  

There
can be no assurance that our existing cash reserves, together with funds generated by our operations, borrowings available under
the KBS Loan Agreement and any future financings, will be sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations. Our inability to
generate funds or obtain financing sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations may result in such obligations being accelerated
by our lenders, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Given these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to avoid liquidity issues
and/or fund operations beyond one year from September 30, 2016.  

3.   
       RECENTLY
    ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT    

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU
2015-03 ). The amendments in this guidance require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements , which allows for the presentation of debt
issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as either a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability
in accordance with ASU 2015-03, or as an asset with subsequent amortization of the debt issuance costs ratably over the term of
the arrangement. As required, ATRM adopted these updates effective January 1, 2016 and elected to present the deferred financing
costs associated with the KBS Loan Agreement as a deduction from the carrying amount of such debt.

Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

Amortization
expense amounted to approximately $51,000 and $152,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and
approximately $61,000 and $282,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Estimated amortization

10.   
       OTHER
    ACCRUED LIABILITIES    

Other
accrued liabilities are comprised of the following (in thousands):  

In
connection with a restructuring of our KBS operations during the third quarter of 2015, we terminated a total of six employees.
Accrued severance costs of $15,000 as of September 30, 2016, are payable in equal weekly amounts through October 2016.  

Changes
in accrued warranty are summarized below (in thousands):  

On
February 23, 2016, ATRM and KBS entered into the KBS Loan Agreement with Gerber Finance, providing KBS with a revolving line
of credit with borrowing availability of up to $4.0 million. The initial term of the KBS Loan Agreement expires on February
22, 2018, but extends automatically for additional one-year periods unless a party provides prior written notice of
termination. Availability under the line of credit is based on a formula tied to KBS s eligible accounts receivable,
inventory, equipment and real estate. Borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.75%, with interest payable monthly.
The outstanding principal balance is payable upon expiration of the term of the KBS Loan Agreement. The KBS Loan Agreement
also provides for certain fees payable to Gerber Finance during its term. KBS s obligations under the KBS Loan
Agreement are secured by all of its property and assets and are guaranteed by ATRM. Unsecured promissory notes issued by KBS
and ATRM are subordinate to KBS s obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement. The KBS Loan Agreement contains
representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and other provisions customary for
financings of this type. Financial covenants require that KBS maintains a maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the KBS Loan
Agreement) of 7:1 at December 31, 2016, and that KBS not incur a net annual post-tax loss in any fiscal year during the term
of the KBS Loan Agreement. At this time, the Company is projecting that it will not be in compliance with these covenants at
December 31, 2016, and has begun discussions with Gerber Finance as to obtaining a waiver. Should the Company be unable to
obtain a waiver from Gerber Finance, it would become an event of default. The occurrence of any event of default under the
KBS Loan Agreement may result in KBS s obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and
payable.  

KBS
made an initial draw of approximately $2.6 million against the line of credit on February 23, 2016, and the balance owing under
the KBS Loan Agreement was approximately $3.0 million at September 30, 2016. We incurred approximately $230,000 of debt issuance
costs in connection with the KBS Loan Agreement. As discussed in Note 3, we present unamortized debt issuance costs as a deduction
from the carrying amount of the line of credit balance. As of September 30, 2016, the net carrying value of the line of credit
was as follows:  

In
April 2014, as partial consideration for the purchase of KBS, we issued a $5.5 million promissory note to the primary seller of
KBS. We were unable to repay the note on its maturity date, December 1, 2014. In April 2015, we asserted certain indemnification
and other claims against the sellers of KBS and on June 26, 2015 we entered into a settlement agreement with the sellers related
to such claims. The settlement agreement provided for, among other things, the amendment of the note to reduce its principal amount
from $5.5 million to $2.5 million and the forgiveness of all then-accrued interest related to the note. The Company recorded a
gain of $3.7 million related to the settlement in June 2015, which is reflected in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.
The amended principal amount is payable in monthly installments of $100,000 on the first business day of each month, which began
on July 1, 2015. See Note 12.  

Long-term
debt consists of the following (in thousands):  

(1)  
      In
    April 2014, we issued the promissory note to LSVI in the original principal amount of $6.0 million. The proceeds from the
    note were used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of KBS. ATRM made principal payments on the
    note of $1.0 million on each of December 30, 2014, and February 25, 2016. On August 31, 2016, ATRM elected to pay PIK Interest
    for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, totaling $261,000, which has been added to the principal balance. The note is
    subordinate to obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement.   

(2)  
      In
    2014, in order to provide additional working capital to ATRM, we issued two promissory notes to LSV Co-Invest I in the amounts
    of $2.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. On August 31, 2016, ATRM elected to pay PIK Interest for the six-month period
    ended June 30, 2016, totaling $273,000, which has been added to the principal balance. The notes are subordinate to obligations
    under the KBS Loan Agreement.   

(3)  
      Promissory
    note payable to the principal seller of KBS. The note does not accrue interest unless it is in default, in which case the
    annual interest rate would be 10%. The Company has imputed interest at an annual rate of 9.5%.   

(4)  
      Agreement
    to finance the purchase of software license rights and consulting services related to the implementation of enterprise management
    information system.   

On
August 12, 2016, the Company and LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I amended the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes allowing the Company,
at its sole option, to elect to make any interest payment in PIK Interest at an effective rate of 12% per annum (versus the 10%
interest rate applied to cash payments) for that period. As of August 31, 2016, the Company elected the PIK Interest option for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. As a result, interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes
PIK Interest related to the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes for the semi-annual interest period ended June 30, 2016,
totaling $534,000 (calculated at the PIK Interest rate of 12% per annum), which includes the incremental interest of approximately
$89,000 for that interest period. This interest has been added to the principal balance of those promissory notes. For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued interest expense on the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes at a rate
of 12% per annum, based on its current intention to exercise the PIK Interest option for the semi-annual interest period ending
December 31, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, LSVI owned 1,067,885 shares of our common stock, or approximately 47.1% of our outstanding shares. Jeffrey
E. Eberwein, ATRM s Chairman of the Board, is the manager of LSVGP, the general partner of LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I, and
sole member of LSVM, the investment manager of LSVI. ATRM s entry into the securities purchase agreements with LSVI and
LSV Co-Invest I was approved by a Special Committee of our Board of Directors consisting solely of independent directors.  

13.   
       STOCK
    INCENTIVE PLAN AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION    

ATRM
uses the fair value method to measure and recognize share-based compensation. We determine the fair value of stock options on
the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We determine the fair value of restricted stock awards based on
the quoted market price of our stock on the grant date. We recognize the compensation expense for stock options and restricted
stock awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the applicable awards.  

2014
Incentive Plan   

Our
2014 Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) was approved by our Board of Directors on October 9, 2014, and became effective
on December 4, 2014, upon approval by shareholders. The 2014 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of
Directors. The purpose of the 2014 Plan is to provide employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors the opportunity
to acquire an equity interest in the Company through the issuance of various stock-based awards such as stock options and restricted
stock. 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock are authorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan.  

On
June 5, 2015, ATRM granted restricted stock awards for a total of 60,000 shares of the Company s common stock to its directors
and its then chief financial officer. The shares vested one year after the grant date. The fair value of the awards was determined
to be $4.48 per share, the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation expense related to these grants amounted
to approximately $0 and $115,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $66,000 and $86,000
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in the caption  Selling, general and
administrative expenses  in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. These shares became fully vested as of June
30, 2016, and all compensation expense related to these grants have been fully recognized.  

2003
Stock Incentive Plan   

A
stock incentive plan approved by our shareholders and adopted in May 2003 (the  2003 Plan ) terminated in February
2013. Stock options granted under the 2003 Plan continue to be exercisable according to their individual terms. The following
table summarizes stock option activity under the 2003 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

All
stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016, are nonqualified options which expire at varying dates through November 2017.
The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above are zero because the option exercise prices for all outstanding options exceeded
ATRM s closing stock price on September 30, 2016.  

We
record the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from tax losses and credits and deductible temporary differences
as  deferred tax assets . We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets
if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Since 2009, we have maintained a valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets. We recorded a full valuation allowance
in 2009 because we determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh
the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position at that time. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation
allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets.
To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future
taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax
benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders  equity.  

At
September 30, 2016, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $18,000 for the taxable differences related to our indefinite-lived
intangible assets when calculating our valuation allowance due to the unpredictability of the reversal of these differences.    

UTHE
Technology Corporation v. Aetrium Incorporated   

Since
December 1993, an action brought by UTHE Technology Corporation ( UTHE ) against ATRM and its then sales manager for
Southeast Asia ( Sales Manager ), asserting federal securities claims, a RICO claim, and certain state law claims,
had been stayed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. UTHE s claims were based on
its allegations that four former employees of a Singapore company, which UTHE formerly owned, conspired to and did divert business
from the subsidiary, and in turn UTHE, and directed that business to themselves and a secret company they had formed, which forced
UTHE to sell its subsidiary shares to the former employee defendants at a distressed price. The complaint alleged that ATRM and
the Sales Manager participated in the conspiracy carried out by the former employee defendants. In December 1993, the case was
dismissed as to the former employee defendants because of a contract requiring UTHE and them to arbitrate their claims in Singapore.
The District Court stayed the case against ATRM and the Sales Manager pending the resolution of arbitration in Singapore involving
UTHE and three of the former employee defendants, but not involving ATRM or the Sales Manager. ATRM received notice in March 2012
that awards were made in the Singapore arbitration against one or more of the former employee defendants who were parties to the
arbitration. In June 2012, UTHE filed a motion to reopen the case against ATRM and the Sales Manager and to lift the stay, which
the court granted. On September 13, 2013, the court entered final judgment dismissing all remaining claims UTHE asserted against
ATRM in the litigation. On September 23, 2013, UTHE appealed the district court judgment to the United States Court of Appeal
for the Ninth Circuit only as to the dismissal of UTHE s RICO claim. The appeal was argued in a court hearing on November
19, 2015. On December 11, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued an order reversing the district court s grant of summary judgment
of UTHE s RICO claim and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings. On April 20, 2016, the district
court stayed the case pending a decision in the Supreme Court case  RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. The European Community , No. 15-138.
A decision in the  RJR Nabisco  case was issued on June 20, 2016. On July 14, 2016, ATRM filed a motion for summary judgment
in the district court seeking dismissal in light of the  RJR Nabisco  decision. On August 26, 2016, the district court granted
ATRM s motion for summary judgment and the case was dismissed. On September 19, 2016, UTHE filed its appeal of the district
court s summary judgment. UTHE s opening appeal brief is due on December 28, 2016. The Company will have until January
30, 2017, to submit its response brief, to which UTHE will have until February 13, 2017, to file a response brief. The court will
set a date for hearing oral arguments, after which the court will render its decision on the appeal. We continue to believe that
the claims asserted in this matter do not have any merit and intend to vigorously defend the action.  

Avila
Plumbing   Heating Contractor, Inc. v. Modular Fun I, Inc. f/k/a KBS Building Systems, Inc.   KBS Builders, Inc. (Maine
Superior Court, Oxford County, CV-15-39)   

Avila
Plumbing and Heating Contractor, Inc. ( Contractor ) had alleged that Modular Fun I, Inc., f/k/a KBS Building Systems
Inc.   KBS Builders, Inc. (the  KBS Parties ) had failed to pay Contractor $476,477.46 that Contractor had claimed
it was entitled to pursuant to contracts between it and the KBS Parties. Contractor had claimed it entered into agreements with
the KBS Parties in relation to two separate projects to supply materials and furnish services relating to the design and installation
of plumbing and HVAC systems. Contractor had claimed it did the work and furnished the materials contracted for and that the KBS
Parties had not paid it pursuant to the contract. KBS had countersued for breach of contract and negligence, claiming that Contractor
had failed to properly complete the plumbing and HVAC services it was retained to perform on one of the projects. The general
contractor on that project had refused to pay KBS $518,842 that KBS was owed citing significant deficiencies in work performed
and materials installed by Contractor as its reason for withholding payment from KBS. KBS had filed a lien in the amount of $518,842
on the property where such project is located and had brought a separate suit against the general contractor and others in Middlesex
Superior Court in Massachusetts to enforce its lien and collect the amount owed to KBS on the project. The case was dismissed
on April 12, 2016.  

KBE
Building Corporation v. KBS Builders, Inc., and ATRM Holdings, Inc., et. al.   

At
the time of the KBS acquisition in April 2014, KBS purchased receivables for a construction project known as the Nelton Court
Housing Project ( Nelton Court ) in Hartford, CT, and also performed certain  punch-list  and warranty
work. Modular units for the Nelton Court project were supplied by KBS Building Systems, Inc. ( KBS-BSI ) pursuant
to a contract with KBE Building Corporation ( KBE ). KBE has asserted claims against KBS-BSI, KBS and ATRM arising
out of alleged delays, and for the repair of certain alleged defects in the modular units supplied to the project. KBE s
claim seeks an unspecified amount of damages. The action has been transferred to the complex litigation docket of the Hartford
Superior Court. The Court has set a trial date for February 2018. We continue to believe that the claims asserted in this matter
do not have any merit and intend to vigorously defend the action.  

EBGL
Asset Purchase    

On
October 4, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of EdgeBuilder Wall Panels, Inc. and Glenbrook Lumber   Supply,
Inc. (collectively, the  Sellers ) through the Company s newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiaries
EdgeBuilder, Inc. ( EdgeBuilder ) and Glenbrook Building Supply, Inc. ( Glenbrook ), respectively,
pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of the same date (the  Purchase Agreement ), by
and among the Company, EdgeBuilder, Glenbrook, the Sellers and the individual owners of the Sellers (the  EBGL
Acquisition ). The Company operates the businesses of EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook on a combined basis, and such
businesses are referred to on a combined basis as  EBGL .  

Consideration
for the EBGL Acquisition included approximately $4.0 million in cash, of which approximately $3.0 million (net of liability
assumed) was paid at closing and $1.0 million is payable in four equal installments on the first day of each of the next four
fiscal quarters, and 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and a potential earn-out payment of up to $1.0
million based upon the amount by which EBGL s gross profit over the 12 months commencing October 1, 2016, exceeds a
specified target and the assumption of certain liabilities of the Sellers related to the purchased assets. The cash
portion of the purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment based on the amount of inventory and pre-paid expenses
included in the purchased assets, and the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for 12 months following the
closing.  

Estimated
total purchase price is as follows:  

Preliminary
fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction are as follows:   

We
incurred expenses for professional fees associated with the EBGL Acquisition of approximately $0.4 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. These costs are included in the caption  Selling, general and administrative expenses  in
our condensed consolidated statement of operations.  

Financing
from Gerber Finance Inc.    

On
October 4, 2016, concurrently with the closing of the EGBL Acquisition, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement,
dated as of the same date (the  EBGL Acquisition Loan Agreement ), with EBGL as the borrowers, the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries KBS Builders, Inc. and Maine Modular Haulers, Inc. as guarantors, and Gerber Finance as the lender,
pursuant to which Gerber Finance provided EBGL with $3.0 million in financing for the EBGL Acquisition. On October 4, 2016, concurrently
with the closing of the EBGL Acquisition, the same parties also entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of the same
date (the  EBGL LOC Loan Agreement ), pursuant to which Gerber Finance agreed to provide EBGL with a working capital
line of credit of up to $3.0 million. The EBGL Acquisition Loan Agreement and the EBGL LOC Loan Agreement are referred to collectively
as the  EBGL Loan Agreements .  

Borrowings
under the EBGL Acquisition Loan Agreement bear interest at the prime rate plus 3.00%, with interest payable monthly and the outstanding
principal balance payable upon expiration of the term of the EBGL Acquisition Loan Agreement. The initial term of the EBGL Acquisition
Loan Agreement expires on December 31, 2018, but extends automatically for additional one-year periods unless a party provides
prior written notice of termination. Availability under the EBGL LOC Loan Agreement is based on a formula tied to the borrowers 
eligible accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus 2.75%, with interest
payable monthly and the outstanding principal balance payable upon expiration of the term of the EBGL LOC Loan Agreement. Initially,
availability under the EBGL LOC Loan Agreement is limited to $1.0 million, which amount may be increased to up to $3.0 million
in increments upon request of the borrowers and in the discretion of Gerber Finance. The initial term of the EBGL LOC Loan Agreement
expires on October 3, 2018, but extends automatically for additional one-year periods unless a party provides prior written notice
of termination.  

The
EBGL Loan Agreements provide for certain fees payable to Gerber Finance during their terms, including but not limited to a monthly
minimum loan amount fee and an annual facility fee. The borrowers  obligations under the EBGL Loan Agreements are secured
by all of their property and assets and are guaranteed by the Company and its other subsidiaries. The EBGL Loan Agreements contain
representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and other provisions customary for agreements
of this type. Financial covenants include maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum debt service coverage ratio
at fiscal year end. The occurrence of any event of default under any EBGL Loan Agreement may result in the obligations thereunder
becoming immediately due and payable.  

As
a condition to the extension of credit to the borrowers under the EBGL Loan Agreements, the Sellers entered into a subordination
agreement, and certain holders of unsecured promissory notes issued by the Company entered into amendments to their existing subordination
agreements, with Gerber Finance and the Company pursuant to which the obligations of the Company to such parties are subordinated
to the obligations to Gerber Finance under the EBGL Loan Agreements.  

Financing
from Lone Star Value Co-Invest I, LP    

On
October 4, 2016, the Company issued to LSV Co-Invest I an unsecured promissory note made by the Company in the principal amount
of $2.0 million in exchange for $2.0 million in cash (the  October 2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note ). The October 2016 LSV
Co-Invest I Note was issued pursuant to a securities purchase agreement by and between the Company and LSV Co-Invest I. The October
2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note bears interest at 10.0% per annum, with interest payable semiannually; provided, however, for interest
accruing during the 365 days after the issuance of the October 2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note, the Company may elect to make any interest
payment in PIK Interest at an annual rate of 12.0%, so long as any such interest payment is made either entirely in PIK Interest
or 50% cash and 50% PIK Interest. LSV Co-Invest I may elect to receive PIK Interest in lieu of cash starting 366 days after the
issuance of the October 2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note. Any unpaid principal and interest under the October 2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note
is due on April 1, 2019. The Company may prepay the October 2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note at any time after a specified amount of
advance notice to LSV Co-Invest I (subject to restrictions under the Company s loan agreements with Gerber Finance). The
October 2016 LSV Co-Invest I Note provides for customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which may result in the principal
and unpaid interest then outstanding becoming immediately due and payable.

Results
of Operations   

Net
Loss.  Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $5.3 million as compared to net loss of approximately
$1.5 million for the same period in 2015. The change from the prior year period was primarily due to a nonrecurring, non-cash
$1.7 million impairment charge taken in September 2016 related to the write-down of the KBS goodwill in addition to a one-time
settlement gain of approximately $3.7 million recognized in the 2015 periods, without a similar gain in the 2016 periods partially
offset by improved gross margins and lower overall operating costs due to ongoing cost control measures. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $2.5 million, which included the nonrecurring, non-cash
$1.7 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in September 2016. This compares to a net loss of approximately $2.4 million
for the same period in 2015. The decrease of $0.1 million was primarily related to the $1.7 million goodwill impairment charge
taken in 2016, partially offset by $0.5 million in increased sales, $0.6 million in lower cost of goods sold and $0.5 million
in lower selling, general and administrative expenses versus the same period of the prior year (see further discussion below).  

Net
Sales . Net sales were approximately $17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with approximately
$20.0 million for the same period in 2015. While net sales for the first nine months of the year decreased by approximately $2.1
million versus the prior year, the Company believes that its strategic initiatives at KBS are beginning to show positive results.
While the nine-month results show a decrease in net sales, the results for the three months ended September 30, 2016, show that
net sales increased over the prior year. The decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus the prior
year was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of commercial structures and to a lesser extent a decrease in sales of
residential homes. Sales of residential homes amounted to approximately $14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared with approximately $14.7 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to generally
lower sales volume in the first half of 2016 and delays in re-opening our Waterford factory. Sales of commercial structures were
approximately $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with approximately $5.3 million for the same
period in 2015. We have completed the service work related to these  legacy  projects and believe we are now in a
position to grow our commercial business with project scopes and terms that are more favorable to KBS than in the past. KBS continues
to be selective in the major commercial projects it selects and is seeking out good quality commercial projects with desirable
customers. Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased to $6.9 million compared with $6.4 million for the same
period in 2015. This was primarily due to the increase in net sales related to commercial projects which totaled approximately
$1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to only $0.6 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in net sales from residential single family homes, which for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, totaled approximately $5.5 million as compared to approximately $5.8 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Cost
of Sales . Cost of sales amounted to approximately $17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with
approximately $20.4 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in 2016 was attributed primarily to lower commercial project
sales, partially offset by reduced costs related to legacy projects. Cost of goods sold in both 2016 and 2015 reflected inefficiencies
associated with seasonally slower sales activity typically experienced in the first quarter as we retained skilled workers for
the upcoming building season. Additionally, for the second quarter of 2016, we incurred additional costs related to bringing our
second factory back up to full production level in anticipation of the peak building season. Cost of sales amounted to approximately
$6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with approximately $6.9 million for the same period in 2015.
Despite the increase in sales for the quarter, the decrease in cost of sales versus the prior year third quarter is the result
of the Company s concerted efforts to be more selective on commercial projects, improved project pricing and ongoing cost
control measures.  

Selling,
General and Administrative . Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expense was approximately $3.2 million
and $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decrease in SG A expense of $0.5
million is primarily attributable to non-recurring severance costs of approximately $0.4 million recorded in September 2015 related
to the restructuring of KBS operations in 2015. No such expense was incurred in 2016. SG A expense was approximately $1.0
million the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $1.5 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease of
approximately $0.4 million is primarily attributable to a $0.4 million reduction in severance costs discussed above.  

Goodwill
Impairment Charge.  We completed a goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2016, and determined that the value of
goodwill was zero versus the carrying value of goodwill of $1.7 million as of that date. While the Company continues to implement
its strategic plans for change at KBS and these changes are beginning to materialize in KBS s operating results, KBS s
performance has lagged behind management s expectations and we have been unable to fully perform to our projected levels
of revenue and net income. Despite improving operating results, actual results have continued to fall short of expectations. Accordingly,
until we can perform to the levels of our expectations, we determined that it was prudent to adjust our projections in our impairment
analysis to reflect the historical shortfalls in results. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the amount
of approximately $1.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. No impairment charge was recorded in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Interest Expense.  Interest
expense remained unchanged at approximately $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015. While the Company
was able to reduce interest related to the reduction in the principal of the promissory note owed to the seller of KBS as a result
of the negotiated settlement, the Company had increased interest expense related to the Gerber revolving working capital line of
credit at KBS as well as increased interest expense related to the PIK Interest option on the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory
notes. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $0.4 million versus $0.3 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily related to the Company accruing interest on the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest
I promissory notes at the PIK Interest rate of 12% (versus 10% effective interest rate for the cash payment of interest) in 2016
as it expects to elect the PIK Interest option for the current interest period. 

Settlement
Gain.  As noted above, in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a settlement gain of approximately $3.7 million
as a result of the settlement agreement with the primary seller of KBS whereby, among other things, the principal amount on the
seller s note was reduced from $5.5 million to $2.5 million and all then-accrued interest related to the note was forgiven.
There was no similar gain for the same period of 2016.  

Income
Taxes . Since 2009, we have maintained a valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets. We expect to continue
to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability
to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than
not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would
be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders 
equity. We recorded income tax expense of $7,000 and $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
which included deferred income tax expense associated with taxable differences related to our indefinite-lived intangible assets
which are omitted from the calculation of our valuation allowance due to the unpredictability of the reversal of these differences.  

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Cash
and cash equivalents decreased by approximately $0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Cash
flows used in operating activities . In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows used in operating activities were
approximately $1.8 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of approximately $5.3 million partially offset by the non-cash
goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million, non-cash PIK Interest of approximately $0.5 million, approximately $0.6
million of non-cash depreciation amortization and share-based compensation expense, and changes in net working capital of approximately
$0.7 million. Working capital changes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, netted to approximately $0.7 and included
a $1.2 million increase in trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments and increased production activity in the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, while decreases in accounts receivable of $1.1 million and increases in costs and estimated profit in
excess of billings of $1.1 million related to homes completed but not yet shipped as of September 30, 2016. Other changes in working
capital included an increase of approximately $0.1 million in other current assets and decreases of approximately $0.3 million
and $0.6 million in billings in excess of costs and estimated profit, and other accrued liabilities, respectively, partially offset
by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in inventory and an increase of approximately $0.3 million in accrued compensation.  

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash flows used in operating activities was approximately $4.0 million, consisting primarily
of our net loss of approximately $5.2 million (excluding a $3.7 million non-cash settlement gain), partially offset by approximately
$0.6 million in non-cash depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation expense and approximately $0.5 million in working
capital changes. Working capital changes generating cash included decreases of approximately $0.8 million in costs and estimated
profit in excess of billings and increases of $0.4 million in billings in excess of costs and estimated profit, $0.2 million in
accrued compensation and $0.4 million in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in accounts receivable
and a decrease of approximately $0.4 million in accounts payable. The increases in accounts receivable and billings in excess
of costs and estimated profit and the decreases in costs and estimated profit in excess of billings primarily reflected a relatively
higher average percentage of completion of KBS commercial projects in progress at September 30, 2015 compared with that at December
31, 2014. The decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from the timing of payments. The increase in other accrued liabilities
included a $0.4 million accrual for severance costs related to the restructuring of our KBS operations described above and a $0.2
million accrual for reimbursement of certain fees and expenses of a related party, partially offset by decreases of $0.1 million
in each of accrued health insurance costs and accrued facility costs.  

Cash
flows generated by investing activities . Cash flows from investing activities were approximately $0.3 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $1.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
was primarily the result of lower royalty payments received related to the transfer of a former product line to a third party
in fiscal year 2014. Royalty payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $0.2 million versus $1.1
million for the same period in 2015. In addition to lower sales volume in 2016, the royalty rate was reduced from approximately
14% (on average) to approximately 9.5% (on average) in 2016 per agreement.  

Cash
flows generated by financing activities . In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows generated by financing activities
was approximately $1.0 million, which included approximately $3.0 million of net advances under the KBS Loan Agreement, partially
offset by the payments of approximately $0.2 million of costs related to our entry into the KBS Loan Agreement and approximately
$1.9 million to reduce principal balances of our long-term debt. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash flows generated
by financing activities was approximately $2.7 million, which consisted primarily of $3.0 million from the issuance of common
stock and $1.0 million received from the sale of a $1.0 million promissory note to LSVI, partially offset by principal repayments
of approximately $1.3 million.  

We
have incurred significant operating losses in recent years. Beginning in 2013, we implemented several strategic initiatives intended
to stabilize the Company and return us to profitability, including the sales of two semiconductor equipment product lines in July
2013 and April 2014, respectively. Also in April 2014, we acquired KBS because we believed there is significant growth opportunity
in the modular housing industry and it provides ATRM with the potential to return to profitability. However, there can be no assurance
that KBS will generate sufficient revenue in the future to cover our expenses and allow us to achieve profitability, on a consistent
basis or at all.  

As
discussed in Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, on February 23, 2016, we entered into the KBS Loan Agreement
with Gerber Finance providing KBS with a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $4.0 million. At this time, the
Company is projecting that it will not be in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2016, and has begun discussions with
Gerber Finance as to obtaining a waiver. Should the Company be unable to obtain a waiver from Gerber Finance, it would become
an event of default. The occurrence of any event of default under the KBS Loan Agreement may result in KBS s obligations
under the KBS Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and payable.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding debt totaling approximately $12.9 million. This debt included $2.8 million (net of deferred
financing costs) owed under a line of credit with Gerber Finance under the KBS Loan Agreement and approximately $1.0 million principal
amount outstanding under an unsecured promissory note issued to the primary seller of KBS. Our debt also includes $4.3 million
principal amount of a promissory note issued to LSVI and $4.8 million principal amount of promissory notes issued to LSV Co-Invest
I. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually and any unpaid principal and interest is due on April 1, 2019.  

We received a waiver from LSVI and
LSV Co-Invest I with respect to our interest payments under the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes due on July 5, 2016,
totaling approximately $445,000, permitting us to make these payments at any time on or before August 31, 2016. On August 12, 2016,
the Company and LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I amended the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes allowing the Company, at its sole
option, to elect to make any interest payment in PIK Interest at an annual rate of 12% (versus the 10% interest rate applied to
cash payments) for that period. As of August 31, 2016, the Company elected the PIK Interest option for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2016. The Company also accrued interest on the LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I promissory notes for the three months ended September
30, 2016, at the PIK Interest rate of 12% per annum as it expects to elect the PIK interest option when the interest payment becomes
due in June 2017. 

We
intend to pursue new financing at the parent level to replace all or a portion of the debt owing to LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I and
to provide for our general working capital needs. There can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such new financing,
on terms favorable to us or at all. Until such time as we obtain additional financing, we may be dependent on LSVI and LSV Co-Invest
I, or other third parties, to provide for our general working capital needs. Although not a binding commitment, LSVM has advised
us of its present intention to continue to financially support the Company as we pursue new financing.  

There
can be no assurance that our cash and cash equivalents, together with funds generated by our operations and any future financings,
will be sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations. In addition, in order to execute our long-term growth strategy, which
may include additional acquisitions, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings,
or other means.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on their evaluation of
our disclosure controls and procedures, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Description
of Material Weakness    

KBS,
which we acquired in April 2014, represents our primary business activity. Prior to the acquisition, the KBS operations were a
privately-owned business with very limited administrative and accounting resources, outdated accounting software and generally
weak accounting processes and internal control procedures. Specifically, material weaknesses existed in KBS s financial
reporting processes with respect to (1) control over accounts payable cut-offs, (2) inventory accounting, (3) contract accounting
and (4) inadequate segregation of duties in certain accounting processes, including the payroll, cash receipts and disbursements
processes and management of user access rights in our accounting system, partly as a result of our limited size and accounting
staff.  

Remediation
of Material Weakness   

We
are working to remediate these material weaknesses. Since the April 2014 acquisition of KBS, we hired an accounting professional
in July 2014 with relevant experience to assist in the effort to implement improvements at KBS and implemented additional organizational
changes in 2015 to strengthen the accounting and other administrative functions at KBS. We have implemented improvements in processes,
procedures and controls, including in the areas of payroll processing, contract accounting, proper transaction cutoffs, inventory
controls, financial reporting and management oversight. In January 2016, we installed a new management information system at KBS
that we believe, when fully implemented, will significantly improve our reporting and controls. During 2016, we continued to implement
new procedures with respect to inventory accounting and controls, as well as continued work on the integration of the new management
information system. Although significant progress has been made in improving the controls at KBS, additional time is required
to fully develop adequate processes, procedures and controls and to determine that such processes and controls are effective.
We will continue to work to improve such processes, procedures and controls, and will disclose in future periods the progress
we have made in our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

As
a result of the control deficiencies at KBS discussed above, we determined that we have material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting. We are working to remediate these material weaknesses as discussed above.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION    

Item1.
Legal Proceedings   

UTHE
Technology Corporation v. Aetrium Incorporated   

Since
December 1993, an action brought by UTHE Technology Corporation ( UTHE ) against ATRM and its then sales manager for
Southeast Asia ( Sales Manager ), asserting federal securities claims, a RICO claim, and certain state law claims,
had been stayed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. UTHE s claims were based on
its allegations that four former employees of a Singapore company, which UTHE formerly owned, conspired to and did divert business
from the subsidiary, and in turn UTHE, and directed that business to themselves and a secret company they had formed, which forced
UTHE to sell its subsidiary shares to the former employee defendants at a distressed price. The complaint alleged that ATRM and
the Sales Manager participated in the conspiracy carried out by the former employee defendants. In December 1993, the case was
dismissed as to the former employee defendants because of a contract requiring UTHE and them to arbitrate their claims in Singapore.
The District Court stayed the case against ATRM and the Sales Manager pending the resolution of arbitration in Singapore involving
UTHE and three of the former employee defendants, but not involving ATRM or the Sales Manager. ATRM received notice in March 2012
that awards were made in the Singapore arbitration against one or more of the former employee defendants who were parties to the
arbitration. In June 2012, UTHE filed a motion to reopen the case against ATRM and the Sales Manager and to lift the stay, which
the court granted. On September 13, 2013, the court entered final judgment dismissing all remaining claims UTHE asserted against
ATRM in the litigation. On September 23, 2013, UTHE appealed the district court judgment to the United States Court of Appeal
for the Ninth Circuit only as to the dismissal of UTHE s RICO claim. The appeal was argued in a court hearing on November
19, 2015. On December 11, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued an order reversing the district court s grant of summary judgment
of UTHE s RICO claim and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings. On April 20, 2016, the district
court stayed the case pending a decision in the Supreme Court case  RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. The European Community , No. 15-138.
A decision in the  RJR Nabisco  case was issued on June 20, 2016. On July 14, 2016, ATRM filed a motion for summary judgment
in the district court seeking dismissal in light of the  RJR Nabisco  decision. On August 26, 2016, the district court granted
ATRM s motion for summary judgment and the case was dismissed. On September 19, 2016, UTHE filed its appeal of the district
court s summary judgment. UTHE s opening appeal brief is due on December 28, 2016. The Company will have until January
30, 2017, to submit its response brief, to which UTHE will have until February 13, 2017, to file a response brief. The court will
set a date for hearing oral arguments, after which the court will render its decision on the appeal. We continue to believe that
the claims asserted in this matter do not have any merit and intend to vigorously defend the action.  

Avila
Plumbing   Heating Contractor, Inc. v. Modular Fun I, Inc. f/k/a KBS Building Systems, Inc.   KBS Builders, Inc. (Maine
Superior Court, Oxford County, CV-15-39)   

Avila
Plumbing and Heating Contractor, Inc. ( Contractor ) had alleged that Modular Fun I, Inc., f/k/a KBS Building Systems
Inc.   KBS Builders, Inc. (the  KBS Parties ) had failed to pay Contractor $476,477.46 that Contractor had claimed
it was entitled to pursuant to contracts between it and the KBS Parties. Contractor had claimed it entered into agreements with
the KBS Parties in relation to two separate projects to supply materials and furnish services relating to the design and installation
of plumbing and HVAC systems. Contractor had claimed it did the work and furnished the materials contracted for and that the KBS
Parties had not paid it pursuant to the contract. KBS had countersued for breach of contract and negligence, claiming that Contractor
had failed to properly complete the plumbing and HVAC services it was retained to perform on one of the projects. The general
contractor on that project had refused to pay KBS $518,842 that KBS was owed citing significant deficiencies in work performed
and materials installed by Contractor as its reason for withholding payment from KBS. KBS had filed a lien in the amount of $518,842
on the property where such project is located and had brought a separate suit against the general contractor and others in Middlesex
Superior Court in Massachusetts to enforce its lien and collect the amount owed to KBS on the project. The case was dismissed
on April 12, 2016.  

KBE
Building Corporation v. KBS Builders, Inc., and ATRM Holdings, Inc., et. al.   

At
the time of the KBS acquisition in April 2014, KBS purchased receivables for a construction project known as the Nelton Court
Housing Project ( Nelton Court ) in Hartford, CT, and also performed certain  punch-list  and warranty
work. Modular units for the Nelton Court project were supplied by KBS Building Systems, Inc. ( KBS-BSI ) pursuant
to a contract with KBE Building Corporation ( KBE ). KBE has asserted claims against KBS-BSI, KBS and ATRM arising
out of alleged delays, and for the repair of certain alleged defects in the modular units supplied to the project. KBE s
claim seeks an un-specified amount of damages. The action has been transferred to the complex litigation docket of the Hartford
Superior Court. The Court has set a trial date for February 2018. We continue to believe that the claims asserted in this matter
do not have any merit and intend to vigorously defend the action.
