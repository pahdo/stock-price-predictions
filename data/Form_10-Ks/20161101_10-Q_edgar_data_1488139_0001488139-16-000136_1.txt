1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
  Ameresco, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the  Company ) was organized as a Delaware corporation on April 25, 2000. The Company is a provider of energy efficiency solutions for facilities throughout North America. The Company provides solutions, both products and services, that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance costs and realize environmental benefits. The Company s comprehensive set of services includes upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure and the construction and operation of small-scale renewable energy plants. It also sells certain photovoltaic ( PV ) equipment worldwide. The Company operates in the United States, Canada and Europe. 
  The Company is compensated through a variety of methods, including: 1) direct payments based on fee-for-services contracts (utilizing lump-sum or cost-plus pricing methodologies); 2) the sale of energy from the Company s operating assets; and 3) direct payment for PV equipment and systems. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are unaudited. In addition, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,   2015  , and notes thereto, included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4,   2016  . The results of operations for the interim periods should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for the full year. 
   
  2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Certain amounts have been reclassified in the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ameresco, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 
  Use of Estimates 
  GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates and assumptions used in these condensed consolidated financial statements relate to management s estimates of final construction contract profit in accordance with accounting for long-term contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, project development costs, fair value of derivative financial instruments and stock-based awards, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, self insurance reserves and any potential liability in conjunction with certain commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  The Company is self-insured for employee health insurance. The maximum exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the plan is   $100   per covered participant, after which reinsurance takes effect. The liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported claims, is determined by management and reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheets in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The liability is calculated based on historical data, which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims. The Company s estimated accrual for this liability could be different than its ultimate obligation if variables such as the frequency or amount of future claims differ significantly from management s assumptions. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on deposit, overnight repurchase agreements and amounts invested in highly liquid money market funds. Cash equivalents consist of short term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains accounts with financial institutions and the balances in such accounts, at times, exceed federally insured limits. This credit risk is divided among a number of financial institutions that management believes to be of high quality. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates their fair value measured using level one inputs per the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 6.

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents held in an escrow account in association with construction draws for energy savings performance contracts ( ESPCs ), construction of project assets, operations and maintenance ( O M ) reserve accounts and cash collateralized letters of credit as well as cash required under term loans to be maintained in debt service reserve accounts until all obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full. These accounts are primarily invested in highly liquid money market funds. The carrying amount of the cash and cash equivalents in these accounts approximates their fair value measured using level one inputs per the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 6. Restricted cash also includes funds held for clients, which represent assets that, based upon the Company s intent, are restricted for use solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit funds to third parties, primarily utility service providers, relating to the Company s enterprise energy management services. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the Company classified the non-current portion of restricted cash of   $19,333   and   $13,515  , respectively, in other assets on its consolidated balance sheets. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable. Bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified.  
  Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reserved for certain assets related to a customer who declared bankruptcy. Of this amount,   $2,394   was recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts in accounts receivable, net. In addition, the Company recorded a   $476   charge to write-off costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and a   $325   charge for project costs incurred during the first quarter of 2016. The Company has an additional exposure of   $758   for the remaining receivables. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company also reserved for certain assets in its Canada segment totaling   $1,934   due to collectability concerns as a result of its previously disclosed restructuring efforts. This reserve included   $1,655   for doubtful accounts in accounts receivable, net and   $279   reserved against accounts receivable retainage, net. 
  Accounts Receivable Retainage 
  Accounts receivable retainage represents amounts due from customers, but where payments are withheld contractually until certain construction milestones are met. Amounts retained typically range from   5%   to   10%   of the total invoice. The Company classifies as a current asset those retainages that are expected to be billed in the next twelve months. During the year ended December 31,   2015  , based upon an evaluation by management, the Company recorded a reserve totaling   $1,282   against the accounts receivable retainage balance for amounts determined to be potentially uncollectible. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an additional reserve of   $279   against the remaining accounts receivable retainage, net balance. 
  Inventory 
  Inventories, which consist primarily of PV solar panels, batteries and related accessories, are stated at the lower of cost ( first-in, first-out  method) or net realizable value (determined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation). Provisions have been made to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the net realizable value. 
  Prepaid Expenses 
  Prepaid expenses consist primarily of short-term prepaid expenditures that will amortize within one year.

Federal ESPC Receivable 
  Federal ESPC receivable represents the amount to be paid by various federal government agencies for work performed and earned by the Company under specific ESPCs. The Company assigns certain of its rights to receive those payments to third-party investors that provide construction and permanent financing for such contracts. The receivable is recognized as revenue as each project is constructed. Upon completion and acceptance of the project by the government, typically within 24 months of construction commencement, the assigned ESPC receivable from the government and corresponding ESPC liability are eliminated from the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Project Development Costs 
  The Company capitalizes as project development costs only those costs incurred in connection with the development of energy projects, primarily direct labor, interest costs, outside contractor services, consulting fees, legal fees and travel, if incurred after a point in time where the realization of related revenue becomes probable. Project development costs incurred prior to the probable realization of revenue are expensed as incurred. The Company classifies as a current asset those project development efforts that are expected to proceed to construction activity in the twelve months that follow. The Company periodically reviews these balances and writes off any amounts where the realization of the related revenue is no longer probable. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment consists primarily of office and computer equipment, and is recorded at cost. Major additions and improvements are capitalized as additions to the property and equipment accounts, while replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: 
                   Asset Classification 
      
    Estimated Useful Life 
      Furniture and office equipment 
      
    Five years 
      Computer equipment and software costs 
      
    Three to five years 
      Leasehold improvements 
      
    Lesser of term of lease or five years 
      Automobiles 
      
    Five years 
      Land 
      
    Unlimited 

Project Assets 
  Project assets consist of costs of materials, direct labor, interest costs, outside contract services and project development costs incurred in connection with the construction of small-scale renewable energy plants that the Company owns and the implementation of energy savings contracts. These amounts are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenues in the Company s consolidated statements of income on a straight line basis over the lives of the related assets or the terms of the related contracts. 
  The Company capitalizes interest costs relating to construction financing during the period of construction. Capitalized interest is included in project assets, net in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized interest is amortized to cost of revenues in the Company s consolidated statements of income on a straight line basis over the useful life of the associated project asset. There was   $289   and   $232   in interest capitalized for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. There was   $616   and   $480   in interest capitalized for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Routine maintenance costs are expensed in the current year s consolidated statements of income to the extent that they do not extend the life of the asset. Major maintenance, upgrades and overhauls are required for certain components of the Company s assets. In these instances, the costs associated with these upgrades are capitalized and are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining life of the asset or the period until the next required major maintenance or overhaul. Gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 
  The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Examples of such triggering events applicable to the Company s assets include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group or a current-period operating or cash flow

     Table of Contents

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. 
  The Company evaluates recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows before interest associated with the expected uses and eventual disposition of those assets. When these comparisons indicate that the carrying value of those assets is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. 
  From time to time, the Company applies for and receives cash grant awards from the U.S. Treasury Department (the  Treasury ) under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the  Act ). The Act authorized the Treasury to make payments to eligible persons who place in service qualifying renewable energy projects. The grants are paid in lieu of investment tax credits. All of the cash proceeds from the grants were used and recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the applicable project assets. If the Company disposes of the property, or the property ceases to qualify as specified energy property, within   five years   from the date the property is placed in service, then a prorated portion of the Section 1603 payment must be repaid. 
  The Company did not receive any     Section 1603 grants during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     or     September 30, 2015  . 
  For tax purposes, the Section 1603 payments are not included in federal and certain state taxable income and the basis of the property is reduced by   50%   of the payment received. Deferred grant income of   $7,877   and   $8,291   recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31,     2015  , respectively, represents the benefit of the basis difference to be amortized to income tax expense over the life of the related property. 
  Deferred Financing Fees 
  Deferred financing fees relate to the external costs incurred to obtain financing for the Company. Deferred financing fees are amortized over the respective term of the financing using the effective interest method, with the exception of the Company s revolving credit facility, as discussed in Note 11, for which deferred financing fees are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Deferred financing fees are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to long-term debt and capital lease liabilities. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  The Company has classified as goodwill the amounts paid in excess of fair value of the net assets (including tax attributes) of companies acquired in purchase transactions. The Company has recorded intangible assets related to customer contracts, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names and technology, each with defined useful lives. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives on an annual basis (December 31   st   ) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than their carrying values. Judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets. 
  Factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant under-performance relative to plan or long-term projections, significant changes in business strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the base price of the Company s publicly traded stock for a sustained period of time.       Although the Company believes goodwill and intangible assets are appropriately stated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance. 
  See Note 3 for additional disclosures. 
  Other Assets 
  Other assets consist primarily of notes and contracts receivable due to the Company from various customers and non-current restricted cash. Other assets also include the non-current portion of project development costs, accounts receivable retainages, sale-leaseback deferred loss and deferred contract costs.

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

Asset Retirement Obligations 
  The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ( AROs ) when such obligations are incurred. The liability is estimated on a number of assumptions requiring management s judgment, including equipment removal costs, site restoration costs, salvage costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates and is credited to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention of depreciation of plant assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement cost incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31,     2015  , the Company had   no   ARO liabilities recorded. 
  Federal ESPC Liabilities 
  Federal ESPC liabilities represent the advances received from third-party investors under agreements to finance certain energy savings performance contract projects with various federal government agencies. Upon completion and acceptance of the project by the government, typically within 24 months of construction commencement, the ESPC receivable from the government and corresponding ESPC liability is eliminated from the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Until recourse to the Company ceases for the ESPC receivables transferred to the investor, upon final acceptance of the work by the government customer, the Company remains the primary obligor for financing received. 
  Sale-Leaseback 
  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor which gives the Company the option to sell and contemporaneously lease back solar photovoltaic ( solar-PV ) projects. In September 2016, the Company amended its agreement with the investor whereas the investor has committed up to a maximum combined funding amount of   $100,000   through June 30, 2017 on certain projects. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold   one   solar-PV project and in return received   $6,037   under the agreement. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold   three   solar-PV projects and in return received   $7,467   under the agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold   two   solar-PV projects and in return received   $3,541   under the agreement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company sold   two   solar-PV projects and in return received   $7,581   under the agreement. During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold   one   solar-PV project and in return received   $4,925   under the agreement. 
  As part of the agreement, the Company is a party to a master lease agreement that provides for the sale of solar-PV projects to a third-party investor and the simultaneous leaseback of the projects, which the Company then operates and maintains, recognizing revenue through the sale of the electricity and solar renewable energy credits generated by these projects. In sale-leaseback arrangements, the Company first determines whether the solar-PV project under the sale-leaseback arrangement is  integral equipment.  A solar-PV project is determined to be integral equipment when the cost to remove the project from its existing location, including the shipping and reinstallation costs of the solar-PV project at the new site, including any diminution in fair value, exceeds   10%   of the fair value of the solar-PV project at the time of its original installation. When the leaseback arrangement expires, the Company has the option to purchase the solar-PV project for the then fair market value or, in certain circumstances, renew the lease for an extended term. All solar-PV projects sold to date under the sale-leaseback program have been determined by the Company not to be integral equipment as the cost to remove the project from its existing location would not exceed 10% of its original fair value. 
  For solar-PV projects that the Company has determined not to be integral equipment, the Company then determines if the leaseback should be classified as a capital lease or an operating lease. All solar-PV projects sold to date under the sale-leaseback program have been determined by the Company to be capital leases. For leasebacks classified as capital leases, the Company initially records a capital lease asset and capital lease obligation in its consolidated balance sheet equal to the lower of the present value of the Company s future minimum leaseback payments or the fair value of the solar-PV project. For capital leasebacks, the Company defers any gain or loss, representing the excess or shortfall of cash received from the investor compared to the net book value of the asset in the Company s consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sale. The Company records the long term portion of any deferred gain or loss in other liabilities and other assets, respectively, and the current portion of any deferred gain or loss in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, in its consolidated balance sheet and amortizes the deferred amounts over the lease term in cost of revenues in its consolidated statements of income. During the quarter-ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $333   of deferred gain related to sale-leasebacks which will be recognized straight-line over the   25   year lease term. During the quarter-ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded   $124   of deferred loss related to sale-leasebacks which will be recognized straight-line over the   20   year lease terms. During the quarter-ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded   $1,421   of deferred loss related to sale-leasebacks which will be recognized straight-line over the   20   year lease terms.

September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $1,040   and   $1,029   of deferred gain, respectively. which will be recognized straight-line over the   20   to   25   year lease terms. The Company records the capital leaseback assets in project assets, net in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company records the capital lease liabilities in long-term debt and capital lease liabilities, less current portions and deferred financing fees, net in its consolidated balance sheets. During the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $3,158   and   $0   respectively, in capital lease assets and corresponding capital lease liabilities, and during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 the Company recorded   $3,299   in capital lease assets and corresponding capital lease liabilities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $8,830   and   $3,511   respectively, in capital lease assets and corresponding capital lease liabilities. The capital lease assets will be amortized straight-line over the   20   to   25   year lease terms. Leaseback payments made to the lessor, related to the capital lease liabilities, are allocated between interest expense and a reduction to the sale-leaseback financing obligation. The initial lease term for the solar-PV project sold during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   is   25   years with semi-annual leaseback payments due to the investor ranging from   $2   to   $397   over the lease term. The initial lease terms for the solar-PV projects sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are   20   to   25   years with semi-annual leaseback payments due to the investor ranging from   $2   to   $397   over the lease term. The initial lease terms for the solar-PV projects sold during the year ended December 31, 2015 are   20   years with semi-annual leaseback payments due to the investor ranging from   $7   to   $348   over the lease term. 
  Other Liabilities 
  Other liabilities consist primarily of deferred revenue related to multi-year operation and maintenance contracts which expire at various dates through   2031  . Other liabilities also include the fair value of derivatives and the long term portion of sale-leaseback deferred gains. 
  S  ee Note 7 for additional disclosures. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company derives revenues from energy efficiency and renewable energy products and services. Energy efficiency products and services include the design, engineering, and installation of equipment and other measures to improve the efficiency, and control the operation, of a facility s energy infrastructure. Renewable energy products and services include the construction of small-scale plants that produce electricity, gas, heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy, the sale of such electricity, gas, heat or cooling from plants that the Company owns, and the sale and installation of solar energy products and systems. 
  Revenue from the installation or construction of projects is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. The percentage-of-completion for each project is determined on an actual cost-to-estimated final cost basis. Maintenance revenue is recognized as related services are performed. In accordance with industry practice, the Company includes in current assets and liabilities the amounts of receivables related to construction projects realizable and payable over a period in excess of one year. The revenue associated with contract change orders is recognized only when the authorization for the change order has been properly executed and the work has been performed. 
  When the estimate on a contract indicates a loss, or claims against costs incurred reduce the likelihood of recoverability of such costs, the Company records the entire expected loss immediately, regardless of the percentage of completion. 
  Billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings represents advanced billings on certain construction contracts. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represent certain amounts under customer contracts that were earned and billable but not invoiced. 
  The Company sells certain products and services in bundled arrangements, where multiple products and/or services are involved. The Company divides bundled arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The relative selling price is determined using third-party evidence or management s best estimate of selling price. 
  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale and delivery of products, including the output from renewable energy plants, when produced and delivered to the customer, in accordance with specific contract terms, provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the Company s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

The Company recognizes revenues from O M contracts, consulting services and enterprise energy management services as the related services are performed. 
     For a limited number of contracts under which the Company receives additional revenue based on a share of energy savings, such additional revenue is recognized as energy savings are generated. 
  Cost of Revenues 
  Cost of revenues include the cost of labor, materials, equipment, subcontracting and outside engineering that are required for the development and installation of projects, as well as preconstruction costs, sales incentives, associated travel, inventory obsolescence charges, amortization of intangible assets related to customer contracts and, if applicable, costs of procuring financing. A majority of the Company s contracts have fixed price terms; however, in some cases the Company negotiates protections, such as a cost-plus structure, to mitigate the risk of rising prices for materials, services and equipment. 
  Cost of revenues also include the costs of maintaining and operating the small-scale renewable energy plants that the Company owns, including the cost of fuel (if any) and depreciation charges. 
   Income Taxes 
  The Company provides for income taxes based on the liability method. The Company provides for deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities calculated using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return. 
  The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a  more-likely-than-not  threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjusts the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. 
  The Company s liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. 
  The Company considers matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; the Company has no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and the Company believes that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the related tax position. The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 retrospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, the Company has presented all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in its consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  See Note 4 for additional information on the Company s income taxes.    
  Foreign Currency 
  The local currency of the Company s foreign operations is considered the functional currency of such operations. All assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders  equity. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company follows the guidance related to fair value measurements for all of its non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for those recognized at fair value in the financial statements at least annually. These assets include goodwill and long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessments, and non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination. 
  The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, long-term contract receivables, interest rate swaps, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital lease assets and liabilities and short-term and long-term borrowings. Because of their short maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term borrowings approximate fair value. The carrying value of long-term variable-rate debt approximates fair value. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company s long-term debt exceeds its carrying value by approximately   $1,775  . Fair value of the Company s debt is based on quoted market prices or on rates available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities, which are level two inputs of the fair value hierarchy, as defined in Note 6. 
  The Company accounts for its interest rate swaps as derivative financial instruments in accordance with the related guidance. Under this guidance, derivatives are carried on the Company s consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps are determined based on observable market data in combination with expected cash flows for each instrument. 
  See Note 6 for additional information related to fair value measurements. 
  Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
  Stock-based compensation expense results from the issuance of shares of restricted common stock and grants of stock options to employees, directors, outside consultants and others. The Company recognizes the costs associated with restricted stock and option grants using the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. 
  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant-date fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of the stock-based awards, including stock options, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the common stock underlying the award, the expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility. 
  The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent management s estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change, and different assumptions are employed, the stock-based compensation could be materially different in the future. The risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, with maturities approximating the expected life of the stock options. 
  The Company has no history of paying dividends. Additionally, as of each of the grant dates, there was no expectation that the Company would pay dividends over the expected life of the options. The expected life of the awards is estimated using historical data and management s expectations. Because there was no public market for the Company s common stock prior to the Company s initial public offering, for certain option grants management lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, estimates of expected stock volatility were based on that of publicly traded peer companies, and it is expected that the Company will continue to use this methodology until such time as there is adequate historical data regarding the volatility of the Company s publicly traded stock price. 
  The Company is required to recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest. Actual historical forfeiture rate of options is based on employee terminations and the number of shares forfeited. This data and other qualitative factors are considered by the Company in determining the forfeiture rate used in recognizing stock compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate varies from historical rates and estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities or the terms of the stock option, it may be necessary to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unamortized stock-based compensation expense. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of   $328   and   $396  , respectively, in connection with stock-based payment awards. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    

15 

     Table of Contents  
  AMERESCO, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - (Continued) 
  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

and   2015  , the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of   $1,086   and   $1,367  , respectively, in connection with stock-based payment awards. The compensation expense is allocated between cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income based on the salaries and work assignments of the employees holding the options. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $3,306   of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.8 years  . 
  The Company also accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employee directors and consultants at fair value. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterparty s performance is complete. No awards to individuals who were not either an employee or director of the Company occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or during the year ended   December 31,     2015  . 
  Share Repurchase Program 
           In April 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $10,000   of the Company s Class A common stock from time to time on the open market in privately negotiated transactions.  The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes. The repurchase program will be funded using the Company's working capital and borrowings under its revolving line of credit. The Company accounts for share repurchases using the cost method. Under this method, the cost of the share repurchase is recorded entirely in treasury stock, a contra equity account. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   503,246   shares of common stock in the amount of   $2,502  , including fees. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   920,944   shares of common stock in the amount of    $4,451  , including fees. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivatives contracts as part of its risk management strategy to manage exposure to market fluctuations in interest rates. These instruments are subject to various credit and market risks. Controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated. Credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract. The measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value. The Company seeks to manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions only through counterparties that the Company believes to be creditworthy. 
  Market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in interest rates. The Company seeks to manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. As a matter of policy, the Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. The Company considers the use of derivatives with all financing transactions to mitigate risk. 
  The Company recognizes cash flows from derivative instruments as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The effective portion of changes in fair value on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The ineffective portion of changes in fair value on interest rate swaps designated as hedges and changes in fair value on interest rate swaps not designated as hedges are recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 
  During 2007, the Company entered into   two   interest rate swap contracts under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swaps cover initial notional amounts of   $13,081   and   $3,256  , each a variable rate note at fixed interest rates of   5.4%   and   5.3%  , respectively, and expire in March 2024 and February 2021, respectively. These interest rate swaps qualified, but were not designated, as cash flow hedges until April 1, 2010. Since April 2010, they have been designated as hedges. 
  In March 2010, the Company entered into a   fourteen  -year interest rate swap contract under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swap covers an initial notional amount of approximately   $27,900   variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of   6.99%   and expires in December 2024. This swap was

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

designated as a hedge in March 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, this swap was de-designated and re-designated as a hedge as a result of a partial pay down of the associated hedged debt principal.  
  In July 2011, the Company entered into a   five  -year interest rate swap contract under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swap covered an initial notional amount of   $38,571   variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of   1.965%   and expired in June 2016. This interest rate swap had been designated as a hedge since inception. 
  In October 2012, the Company entered into   two     eight  -year interest rate swap contracts under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swaps cover an initial notional amount of   $16,750   variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of   1.71%  . This notional amount increased to   $42,247   on September 30, 2013 and expires in March 2020. These interest rate swaps have been designated as hedges since inception. 
  In October 2012, the Company also entered into   two     eight  -year forward starting interest rate swap contracts under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swaps cover an initial notional amount of   $25,377   variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of   3.70%  , with an effective date of March 31, 2020, and expires in June 2028. These interest rate swaps have been designated as hedges since inception. 
  In September 2015, the Company entered into a   seven  -year forward starting interest rate swap contract under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swap covers an initial notional amount of   $20,746   variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of   2.19%  , and expires in February 2023. The effective date of the interest rate swap was February 28, 2016. The underlying cash flows hedged have an initial principal balance of   $20,746   with an effective date of March 30, 2016. This interest rate swap has been designated as a hedge since inception. 
  In September 2015, the Company also entered into a   fifteen  -year forward starting interest rate swap contract under which the Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount, and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The swap covers an initial notional amount of   $14,084   variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of   3.26%  , with an effective date of February 28, 2023, and expires in December 2038. This interest rate swap has been designated as a hedge since inception. 
  See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on the Company s derivative instruments. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated using the Company s weighted-average outstanding common shares, including vested restricted shares. When the effects are not anti-dilutive, diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average outstanding common shares; the dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock, under the  if converted  method; and the treasury stock method with regard to warrants and stock options; all as determined under the treasury stock method. 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   the total number of shares of common stock related to stock options excluded from the calculation of dilutive shares, as the effect would be anti-dilutive, were   3,437,620   and   2,171,104  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   the total number of shares of common stock related to stock options excluded from the calculation of dilutive shares, as the effect would be anti-dilutive, were   3,437,620   and   1,704,004  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   the Company has excluded stock options from the calculation of

     Table of Contents

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

dilutive shares under the treasury stock method where the sum of the assumed proceeds, including unrecognized compensation and related excess tax benefits, exceeds the difference between the market price and the exercise price. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties. The arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the Company to share risks and/or secure specialty skills required for project execution. 
          The Company evaluates each partnership and joint venture at inception to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity ( VIE ) under ASC 810,   Consolidation  . A VIE is an entity used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in ASC 810, the Company reassesses its initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a VIE. 
          The Company also evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each VIE and consolidates the VIE if the Company has both (a) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure, distribution of profits and losses, risks, responsibilities, indebtedness, voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary. The Company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary.  When the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated. As required by ASC 810, management's assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is continuously performed. 
  Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest 
  In September 2015, the Company formed an investment fund with a third party investor which granted the investor ownership interests in the net assets of certain of the Company s renewable energy project subsidiaries. The Company entered into this agreement in order to finance the costs of constructing the project assets which are under long-term customer contracts. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary in the operational partnership for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the Company will consolidate the assets and liabilities and operating results of the entities in its consolidated financial statements. The Company will recognize the investors  share of the net assets of the subsidiary as a redeemable non-controlling interest in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company has determined that the provisions in the contractual arrangement represent a substantive profit-sharing arrangement. The Company has further determined that the appropriate methodology for attributing income and loss to the redeemable non-controlling interest each period is a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value ( HLBV ) method. Under the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributed to the redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of income reflect changes in the amounts the investor would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual agreement, assuming the net assets of this funding structure were liquidated at recorded amounts. The investors  non-controlling interest in the results of operations of this funding structure is determined as the difference in the non-controlling interest s claim under the HLBV method at the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions, such as contributions or distributions, between the Company s subsidiary and the investor. The use of the HLBV methodology to allocate income to the redeemable non-controlling interest holder may create volatility in the Company s consolidated statements of income as the application of HLBV can drive changes in net income available and loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest from quarter to quarter. 
  The Company classified the non-controlling interest with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the Company outside of permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheets. The redeemable non-controlling interest will be reported using the greater of its carrying value at each reporting date as determined by the HLBV method or the estimated redemption value in each reporting period.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance in this ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this ASU

     Table of Contents

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement in this ASU. The FASB has approved a one year deferral of this standard, and this pronouncement is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities would be permitted to adopt the standard as early as the original public entity effective date (i.e., annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein). Early adoption prior to that date is not permitted. Retrospective application of the amendments in this ASU is required. The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption (with some limited relief provided) or a modified retrospective approach. Early application is not permitted under GAAP. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles of current U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt , (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is still present, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  This pronouncement did not change the Company s previous consolidation conclusions. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-03): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  As such, deferred financing fees are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a reduction to long-term debt and capital lease liabilities. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). The guidance in this ASU involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under ASU 2016-09, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the statement of operations and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

3.   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  The changes in the carrying value of goodwill attributable to each reportable segment are as follows: 

Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives. The Company annually assesses whether a change in the life over which the Company s assets are amortized is necessary, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant. No changes to useful lives were made during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or for the year ended   December 31,     2015  .  
  Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill that are subject to amortization include customer contracts, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, technology and trade names. Customer contracts are amortized ratably over the period of the acquired customer contracts ranging in periods from approximately   one   to   five   years. All other acquired intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from approximately   four   to   fifteen   years, as defined by the nature of the respective intangible asset. 
  The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are as follows: 

Amortization expense related to customer contracts is included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Amortization expense related to all other acquired intangible assets is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Amortization expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to customer contracts was   $46   and   $230  , respectively. Amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    related to customer contracts was   $140   and   $689  , respectively. Amortization expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to all other acquired intangible assets was   $536   and   $787  , respectively. Amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to all other acquired intangible assets was   $1,653   and   $2,352  , respectively.

4.   INCOME TAXES 
  The provision for income taxes was   $1,865   and   $3,343   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The provision for income taxes was   $2,872   and   $2,187   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The estimated   2016   effective tax rate was   24.3%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to a   44.4%   estimated annual effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The estimated 2016 effective tax rate was   25.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to a   52.5%   estimated annual effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  The principal reason for the difference between the statutory rate and the estimated annual effective rate for 2016 were the effects of the tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 179D and production tax credits to which the Company is entitled from owned plants. The principal reason for the difference between the statutory rate and the estimated annual effective rate for 2015 were the effects of the valuation allowance required for the expected Canada losses as well as the investment tax credits and production tax credits to which the Company is entitled to from owned plants. 
  The investment tax credits and production tax credits to which the Company may be entitled fluctuate from year to year based on the cost of the renewable energy plants the Company places or expects to place in service and production levels at company owned facilities in that year. In addition, the tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 179D expired as of December 31, 2014 and was retroactively reinstated in December of 2015. The current expiration date for the 179D deduction is December 31, 2016. 
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31,     2015  , the Company had approximately   $1,764   and   $2,200  , respectively, of total gross unrecognized tax benefits. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31,     2015  , the Company had approximately   $400   and   $800  , respectively, of total gross unrecognized tax benefits (net of the federal benefit on state amounts) representing the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods. 
   
  5.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in a variety of claims and other legal proceedings generally incidental to its normal business activities. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
  Solar Tariff Contingency 
  In October 2012, the U.S. Department of Commerce ( Commerce ) announced its final determination in the anti-dumping ( AD ) and countervailing duty ( CVD ) investigations of imports of solar cells manufactured in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ), including solar modules containing such cells. Commerce s final determination confirmed its previously published AD duty of   249.96%  , for manufacturers without a separate rate, and increased its CVD from   3.61%   to   15.24%  ; both duties are applied to the value of imports of solar modules containing PRC cells. On November 7, 2012, the International Trade Commission announced its final determination upholding the duties. All shipments from May 25, 2012 until the Company suspended importing solar modules containing PRC cells in July 2012 ( covered shipments ) were subject to the CVD and were covered by a single continuous entry bond. Covered shipments also were subject to AD duty, for each of which the Company was required to post a single entry bond. In August, 2014, U.S. Customs lifted suspension of liquidation of covered shipments. As a result of liquidation, during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company paid CVD on covered shipments at the   3.61%   rate. During the fourth quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015, the Company paid AD duties

     Table of Contents

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

on covered shipments at a   31.18%   rate. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received the final bill from U.S. Customs for liquidation of   one   remaining covered shipment containing PRC cells and the matter was resolved in the first quarter of 2016. 
  Commitments as a Result of Acquisitions 
  Related to the Company's acquisition of Energyexcel LLP ( EEX ) in the second quarter of 2014, the former owners of EEX, who are now employees of the Company, may be entitled to receive up to   4,500   British pounds sterling (  $5,836   converted as of   September 30, 2016  ) in additional consideration, accounted for as compensation for post-combination services, if the acquired business meets certain financial performance milestones through December 31, 2018.    No   amounts were accrued as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31,     2015  , respectively. 
   
  6.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
  The Company recognizes its financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: 
  Level 1:    Inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 
  Level 2:    Inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
  Level 3:    Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. 
  The following table presents the input level used to determine the fair values of the Company s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps was determined using a cash flow analysis on the expected cash flow of the contract in combination with observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. As part of this valuation, the Company considered the credit ratings of the counterparties to the interest rate swaps to determine if a credit risk adjustment was required. 
  The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation techniques, as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term debt. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated using discounted cash flows analysis, based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements which are considered to be level two inputs. There were no transfers in or out of level two for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Based on the analysis performed, the fair value and the carrying value of the Company s long-term debt, excluding capital lease liabilities, are as follows: 

The Company is also required periodically to measure certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. There were   no   assets recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016  .

8.   INVESTMENT FUND 
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company formed an investment fund for the purpose of funding the purchase of a solar energy system. The Company consolidates the investment fund, and all inter-company balances and transactions between the Company and the investment fund are eliminated in its consolidated financial statements. The Company determined that the investment fund meets the definition of a VIE. The Company uses a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for VIEs that focuses on determining whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance and whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
  The Company has considered the provisions within the contractual arrangements that grant it power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of this VIE, including determining the solar energy systems and associated long term customer contracts to be sold or contributed to the VIE, and installation, operation and maintenance of the solar energy systems. The Company considers that the rights granted to the other investors under the contractual arrangements are more protective in nature rather than participating rights. As such, the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE for all periods presented. The Company evaluates its relationships with VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to be the primary beneficiary. 
  Under the related agreements, cash distributions of income and other receipts by the fund, net of agreed-upon expenses and estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss, and tax benefits of tax credits, are assigned to the fund investor and Company s subsidiary as specified in contractual arrangements. Certain of these arrangements have call and put options to acquire the investor s equity interest as specified in the contractual agreement. See Note 9 for additional information on the call and put options.

     Table of Contents  
  AMERESCO, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - (Continued) 
  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s consolidated balance sheet included   $949   in cash,   $1,554   in restricted cash,   $241   in accounts receivable,   $293   in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,   $43   in prepaid expenses and other current assets,   $32,535   of project assets,   $84   in other assets, and   $33   in accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to the investment fund. At   December 31,     2015  , the Company s consolidated balance sheet included   $5,419   in restricted cash,   $25   in prepaid expenses and other current assets,   $32,657   of project assets, net and   $112   in other assets related to the investment fund. 
   
  9.   NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS  
  Redeemable Non-controlling Interest 
  The Company s wholly owned subsidiary with a membership interest in the investment fund has the right, beginning on the fifth anniversary of the final funding of the variable rate construction and term loans due 2023 and extending for   six months  , to elect to require the non-controlling interest holder to sell all of its membership units to the Company s wholly owned subsidiary (the  Call Option ). The Company s investment fund, which was formed in the third quarter of 2015, also includes a right, beginning on the sixth anniversary of the final funding and extending for   one year  , for the non-controlling interest holder to elect to require the Company s wholly owned subsidiary to purchase all of its membership interests in the fund (the  Put Option ). 
  Because the Put Option represents a redemption feature that is not solely within the control of the Company, the non-controlling interest in these funds is presented outside of permanent equity. Redeemable non-controlling interests are reported using the greater of their carrying value at each reporting date (which is impacted by attribution under the HLBV method) or their estimated redemption value in each reporting period. 
  The purchase price for the fund investor s membership interest under the Call Option is equal to the fair market value as of the exercise date. 
   
  10.   BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Company reports results under ASC 280,   Segment Reporting.   The Company s reportable segments are U.S. Regions, U.S. Federal, Canada and Small-Scale Infrastructure. The Company s U.S. Regions, U.S. Federal and Canada segments offer energy efficiency products and services, which include the design, engineering and installation of equipment and other measures to improve the efficiency and control the operation of a facility s energy infrastructure; renewable energy solutions and services, which include the construction of small-scale plants for customers that produce electricity, gas, heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy; and O M services. The Company s Small-Scale Infrastructure segment sells electricity, processed landfill gas, heat or cooling produced from renewable sources of energy from small-scale plants that the Company owns. The  All Other  category offers enterprise energy management services, consulting services and the sale and installation of solar-PV energy products and systems. These segments do not include results of other activities, such as corporate operating expenses not specifically allocated to the segments. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company also reserved for certain assets in its Canada segment totaling   $1,934   due to collectability concerns as a result of its previously disclosed restructuring efforts. During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company included in unallocated corporate activity   $2,194   and   $3,195  , respectively, as a reserve for a customer who declared bankruptcy. 
  The reports of the Company s chief operating decision maker do not include assets at the operating segment level.

11.   LONG-TERM DEBT  
  Variable-Rate Construction and Term Loans 
  In September 2015, the Company entered into a credit and guaranty agreement for use in providing non-recourse financing for certain of its solar-PV projects currently under construction. The credit and guaranty agreement provides for a   $20,746   construction-to-term loan credit facility and bears interest at a variable rate. The term loan matures on March 30, 2023. On March 30, 2016, the construction loan was converted to a term loan. At   December 31,     2015  ,   $17,663   was outstanding under the construction loan. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $20,572   was outstanding under the term loan. The variable rate for this loan at   September 30, 2016   was   3.34%  . 
  In August 2016, the Company entered into a credit and guaranty agreement with   two   banks for use in providing limited recourse financing for certain of its solar PV projects in operation. The credit and guaranty agreement provides for a   $6,358   Canada dollar (  $4,837   converted as of   September 30, 2016  ) term loan credit facility and bears interest at a fixed rate of   4.95%  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $4,767   was outstanding under the term loan. 
  Senior Secured Credit Facility - Revolver and Term Loan 
  On   June 30, 2015  , the Company entered into a third amended and restated bank credit facility with   two   banks. The new credit facility replaces and extended the Company s existing credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in accordance with its terms on June 30, 2016. The revolving credit facility matures on June 30, 2020 and the term loan facility matures on June 30, 2018, when all amounts will be due and payable in full. The Company expects to use the new credit facility for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions, refinancing of existing indebtedness and working capital. In July 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the third amended and restated bank credit facility.  Under this amendment, the requirement of the total funded debt to EBITDA ratio was amended as described below. 
  The credit facility consists of a   $60,000   revolving credit facility and a   $17,143   term loan. The amount of the term loan represents the amount outstanding under the Company s existing term loan at closing. The revolving credit facility may be increased by up to an additional   $25,000   at the Company s option if lenders are willing to provide such increased commitments, subject to certain conditions. Up to   $20,000   of the revolving credit facility may be borrowed in Canadian dollars, Euros and Pounds Sterling. The Company is the sole borrower under the credit facility. The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of the Company s direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of all of the Company s and such subsidiary guarantors  assets, other than the equity interests of certain subsidiaries and assets held in non-core subsidiaries (as defined in the agreement). At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $18,733   amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and   $10,000   outstanding under the term loan.  At   December 31,     2015  , there was   $11,300   outstanding under the revolving credit facility and   $14,285   outstanding under the term loan. 
  The interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility is based on, at the Company s option, either (1) a base rate equal to a margin of   0.50%   or   0.25%  , depending on the Company s ratio of Total Funded Debt to EBITDA (each as defined in the agreement), over the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate, plus   0.50%  , (b) Bank of America s prime rate and (c) a rate based on the London interbank deposit rate ( LIBOR ) plus   1.50%  , or (2) the one-, two- three- or six-month LIBOR plus a margin of   2.00%   or   1.75%  , depending on the Company s ratio of Total Funded Debt to EBITDA. A commitment fee of   0.375%   is payable quarterly on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was   3.75%   and interest rate for borrowings under the term loan was   2.59%  . 
  The revolving credit facility does not require amortization of principal. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of   $1,429  , with the balance due at maturity. All borrowings may be paid before maturity in whole or in part at the Company s option without penalty or premium, other than reimbursement of any breakage and deployment costs in the case of LIBOR borrowings. 
  The credit facility limits the Company s and its subsidiaries  ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; incur liens or guarantee obligations; merge, liquidate or dispose of assets; make acquisitions or other investments; enter into hedging agreements; pay dividends and make other distributions and engage in transactions with affiliates, except in the ordinary course of business on an arms  length basis.

  (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

Under the credit facility, the Company and its subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in, or loan to, the Company s non-core subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding   49%   of the Company s consolidated stockholders  equity. In addition, under the credit facility, the Company and its core subsidiaries must maintain the following financial covenants:   

  Any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of the credit facility would not only prevent the Company from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, permitting the lenders to, among other things, accelerate the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, under the credit facility, to terminate the credit facility, and enforce liens against the collateral. 
  The credit facility also includes several other customary events of default, including a change in control of the Company, permitting the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness, terminate the credit facility, and enforce liens against the collateral. 
  For purposes of the Company s senior secured facility: EBITDA excludes the results of certain renewable energy projects that the Company owns and for which financing from others remains outstanding; total funded debt includes amounts outstanding under both the term loan and revolver portions of the senior secured credit facility plus other indebtedness, but excludes non-recourse indebtedness of project company subsidiaries; and debt service includes principal and interest payments on the indebtedness included in total funded debt other than principal payments on the revolver portion of the facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial and operational covenants. 
   
  12.   Subsequent Events 
  In October 2016, the Company entered into a non-recourse construction loan agreement with a lender to finance up to   80%   of the value of construction costs on certain solar-PV projects in development.  The maximum amount that can be drawn on the construction loan is   $35,000  . No amounts have been borrowed against the construction loan.

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we undertake no obligation to do so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Overview 
  Ameresco is a leading provider of energy efficiency solutions for facilities throughout North America and Europe. We provide solutions that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance costs and realize environmental benefits. Our comprehensive set of services includes upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure and the construction and operation of small-scale renewable energy plants.  
  In September 2015, we entered into an agreement with a third party investor which granted the investor ownership interests in the net assets of certain of our renewable energy project subsidiaries. We entered into this agreement in order to finance the costs of constructing certain project assets which are under long-term customer contracts. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in the operational partnership for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we will consolidate the assets and liabilities and operating results of the entities in our consolidated financial statements. We recognize the investor s share of the net assets of the investor s funds as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated balance sheets. These income or loss allocations, which will be reflected on our consolidated statements of income, may create significant volatility in our reported results of operations, including potentially changing net income available (loss attributable) to common stockholders from income to loss, or vice versa, from quarter to quarter.  
  In addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets have been an important part of our historical development. Since inception, we have completed numerous acquisitions, which have enabled us to broaden our service offerings and expand our geographical reach. 
  Our acquisition of the energy consultancy and energy project management business of Energyexcel LLP in the third quarter of 2014 added to our local presence in the United Kingdom ( UK ) and to our commercial and industrial customer base. 
  Our acquisition of the business of Ennovate Corporation in the first quarter of 2013 increased our footprint and penetration in the Rocky Mountain area. Our acquisition of energy management consulting companies The Energy Services Partnership Limited (now known as Ameresco Limited) and ESP Response Limited in the second quarter of 2013 added a local presence in the UK, expertise and seasoned energy industry professionals to support multi-national customers of our enterprise energy management service offerings. 
  Effects of Seasonality  
  We are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months, such as the northern United States and Canada, or at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied. In addition, government customers, many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours, typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Further, government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of, and delays in, the legislative process related to government programs and incentives that help drive demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. As a result, our revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarter are typically higher, and our revenues and operating income in the first quarter are typically lower, than in other quarters of the year. As a result of such fluctuations, we may occasionally experience declines in revenue or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.  
  Our annual and quarterly financial results are also subject to significant fluctuations as a result of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. See  Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may fall below expectations in any particular fiscal quarter  in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31,     2015   ( Annual Report ). 
  Backlog and Awarded Projects  
  Total construction backlog represents projects that are active within our ESPC sales cycle. Our sales cycle begins with the initial contact with the customer and ends, when successful, with a signed contract, also referred to as fully-contracted backlog. Our sales cycle recently has been averaging 18 to 42 months. Awarded backlog is created when a potential customer awards a

project to Ameresco following a request for proposal. Once a project is awarded but not yet contracted, we typically conduct a detailed energy audit to determine the scope of the project as well as identify the savings that may be expected to be generated from upgrading the customer s energy infrastructure. At this point, we also determine the sub-contractor, what equipment will be used, and assist in arranging for third party financing, as applicable. Recently, awarded projects have been taking 12 to 18 months to result in a signed contract and thus convert to fully-contracted backlog. It may take longer, however, depending upon the size and complexity of the project. Historically, approximately 90% of our awarded projects ultimately have resulted in a signed contract. After the customer and Ameresco agree to the terms of the contract and the contract becomes executed, the project moves to fully-contracted backlog. The contracts reflected in our fully-contracted backlog typically have a construction period of 12 to 24 months and we typically expect to recognize revenues for such contracts over the same period. Fully-contracted backlog begins converting into revenues generated from backlog on a percentage-of-completion basis once construction has commenced. See  We may not recognize all revenues from our backlog or receive all payments anticipated under awarded projects and customer contracts  and  In order to secure contracts for new projects, we typically face a long and variable selling cycle that requires significant resource commitments and requires a long lead time before we realize revenues  in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had backlog of approximately   $443.8 million   in expected future revenues under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects, which we sometimes refer to as fully-contracted backlog; and we also had been awarded projects for which we do not yet have signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenues of an additional   $1,054.5 million  . As of   September 30, 2015  , we had fully-contracted backlog of approximately   $379.3 million   in expected future revenues under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects; and we also had been awarded projects for which we had not yet signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenues of an additional   $1,032.6 million  . 
  We define our 12-month backlog as the estimated amount of revenues that we expect to recognize in the next twelve months from our fully-contracted backlog. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our 12-month backlog was   $285.9 million   and   $306.8 million  , respectively. 
  Assets in development, which represents the potential design/build project value of small-scale renewable energy plants that have been awarded or for which we have secured development rights, was   $149.0 million   and   $185.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. The most significant estimates with regard to these condensed consolidated financial statements relate to estimates of final contract profit in accordance with long-term contracts, project development costs, project assets, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, fair value of derivative financial instruments, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense.  
  Such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions are made on an ongoing basis, and accordingly, the actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  The following, in no particular order, are certain critical accounting policies that among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements: 
             
    Revenue Recognition; 
                
    Project Assets; 
                
    Derivative Financial Instruments; and 
                
    Variable Interest Entities. 
     Further details regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our Annual Report.

Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management has determined that no material changes concerning our critical accounting policies have occurred since December 31,   2015  . 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance in this ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in ASC 605-35,   Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts  . In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement in this ASU. The FASB has approved a one year deferral of this standard, and this pronouncement is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities would be permitted to adopt the standard as early as the original public entity effective date (i.e., annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein). Early adoption prior to that date would not be permitted. Retrospective application of the amendments in this ASU is required. The new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption (with some limited relief provided) or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles of current U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt , (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is still present, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This pronouncement did not change our previous consolidation conclusions. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-03): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We adopted this accounting standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  As such, prior periods in our financial statements were retrospectively adjusted. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). The guidance in this ASU involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under ASU 2016-09, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be  

30 

     Table of Contents  

recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the statement of operations and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations 
  The following tables set forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of income (loss) expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Revenues 
  The following tables set forth a comparison of our revenues for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Revenues decreased   $8.5 million  , or   4.5%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to a   $20.2 million   decrease in revenues from our U.S. Regions segment and a   $4.2 million   decrease in

     Table of Contents  

revenues from our All Other segment, partially offset by a a   $11.0 million   increase in revenues from our U.S. Federal segment and a   $5.8 million   increase in revenues from our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment. 
  Revenues increased   $19.9 million  , or   4.4%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due to a   $38.2 million   increase in revenues from our U.S. Federal segment, a   $15.6 million   increase in revenues from our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment, and a   $2.4 million   increase in revenues from our Canada segment, partially offset by a   $26.0 million   decrease in revenues from our U.S. Regions segment and a   $10.2 million   decrease in revenues from All Other. 
  Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit 
  The following tables set forth a comparison of our cost of revenues and gross profit for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Cost of revenues decreased   $11.0 million  , or   7.2%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and increased   $8.4 million  , or   2.3%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of 2015, respectively, primarily due to the changes in revenues described above. Gross margin percentage increased to   21.5%   and   20.6%   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from   19.2%   and   19.0%   for the same periods of   2015  , respectively.  The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a favorable mix of higher margin revenues as well as cost budget revisions from a significant project in our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which resulted in an increase in project to date revenues recognized. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was also partially due to cost budget revisions on a significant project in our Canada segment during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in a reduction in project to date revenues recognized and a reserve for potential future losses on the project recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  As a result of certain acquisitions, we have intangible assets related to customer contracts; these are typically amortized over a period of approximately one to five years from the respective date of acquisition. This amortization is recorded as a cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded amortization expense of   $0.1 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, related to customer contracts. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  The following tables set forth a comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $2.2 million  , or   8.4%  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to $2.2 million write-down of accounts receivable related to a customer that declared bankruptcy.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased   $5.4 million  , or   7.0%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to $2.9 million in write-downs, primarily in accounts receivable related to the customer bankruptcy and $1.9 million in bad debt expense in our Canada segment.

     Table of Contents  

Amortization expense of intangible assets related to customer relationships, non-compete agreements, technology and trade names is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. For the   three months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , we recorded amortization expense, related to these intangible assets, of   $0.5 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded amortization expense, related to these intangible assets, of   $1.7 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively. The decrease was due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2015. 
  Other Expenses, Net 
  Other expenses, net includes gains and losses from derivatives and foreign currency transactions, interest income and expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs, net. Other expenses, net, decreased   $1.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in interest expense primarily related to the construction-to-term loan we entered into in September 2015. 
  Income Before Taxes 
  Income before taxes increased   $0.2 million  , or   2.0%  , to   $7.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $7.5 million   for the same period of   2015   due to the reasons described above. Income before taxes increased   $7.3 million   or   175.6%  , to   $11.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $4.2 million   for the same period of   2015   due to the reasons described above. 
  Provision from Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes was   $1.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The provision for income taxes was   $2.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The estimated annual effective tax rate applied for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   24.3%   compared to   44.4%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The estimated annual effective tax rate applied for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   25.0%   compared to   52.5%   for the same period of   2015  . The decrease in the rate compared to the same periods in the prior year was due primarily to the effects of the tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 179D which had expired as of December 31, 2014 and was not available as of June 30, 2015.  It was retroactively reinstated in December of 2015, however, and was available for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The current expiration date for the 179D deduction is December 31, 2016. 
  The principal reasons for the difference between the statutory rate and the estimated annual effective rate for 2016 relate to the effects of the tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code Section 179D and production tax credits to which we are entitled from plants we own. The principal reason for the difference between the statutory rate and the estimated annual effective rate for 2015 were the effects of the valuation allowance required for the expected Canada losses as well as the investment tax credits and production tax credits to which we are entitled from plants we own. 
  The investment tax credits to which we are entitled fluctuate from year to year based on the cost of the renewable energy plants that we place or expect to place in service in that year. 
  Net Income and Earnings Per Share 
  Net income increased   $1.6 million  , or   39.1%  , to   $5.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $4.2 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Net income increased   $6.6 million  , to   $8.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $2.0 million   for the same period of 2015. 
  Basic and diluted earnings per share for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $0.12  , compared to basic and diluted earnings per share for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   of   $0.09  . Basic and diluted earnings per share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $0.19  , an increase of   $0.15   compared to the same period of 2015. 
  Business Segment Analysis (in thousands) 
  We report results under ASC 280,   Segment Reporting.   Our reportable segments are U.S. Regions, U.S. Federal, Canada and Small-Scale Infrastructure. Our U.S. Regions, U.S. Federal and Canada segments offer energy efficiency products and services, which include: the design, engineering and installation of equipment and other measures to improve the efficiency and control the operation of a facility s energy infrastructure; renewable energy solutions and services, which include the construction of small-scale plants that we own or develop for customers that produce electricity, gas, heat or cooling from

     Table of Contents  

renewable sources of energy; and O M services. Our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment sells electricity, processed LFG, heat or cooling, produced from renewable sources of energy and generated by small-scale plants that we own. Our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment also now includes certain small-scale plants developed for customers previously included in our U.S. Regions segment. Previously reported amounts have been restated for comparative purposes. The  All Other  category offers enterprise energy management services, consulting services and integrated-PV. These segments do not include results of other activities, such as corporate operating expenses not specifically allocated to the segments. 
  U.S. Regions 

Revenues for our U.S. Regions segment decreased   $20.2 million  , or   19.4%  , to   $83.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and decreased   $26.0 million  , or   11.7%  , to   $195.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015  , respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the number of active projects. 
  Income before taxes for our U.S. Regions segment decreased   $2.7 million  , or   25.2%  , to   $7.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and decreased   $5.9 million  , or   31.8%  , to   $12.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015  , respectively, primarily due to the decrease in revenues described above, which resulted in decreased operating leverage. 
  U.S. Federal 

Revenues for our U.S. Federal segment increased   $11.0 million  , or   31.0%  , to   $46.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and increased   $38.2 million  , or    42.4%  , to   $128.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015  , respectively, primarily due to an increase in project size and the timing of revenue recognized as a result of the phase of active projects. 
  Income before taxes for our U.S. Federal segment increased   $1.0 million  , or   23.2%  , to   $5.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to the increase in revenues described above.  Income before taxes for our U.S. Federal segment increased   $3.7 million  , or   29.1%  , to   $16.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by a budget revision on a large project in the second quarter of 2016.

Canada 

Revenues for our Canada segment decreased   $0.9 million  , or   7.1%  , to   $12.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to the phase of active projects.  Revenues for our Canada segment  increased   $2.4 million  , or   6.3%  , to   $40.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015  , primarily due to cost budget revisions, during the first quarter of 2015, on a significant project which resulted in a reduction in project to date revenues recognized in 2015, as well as an increase in the size of active projects in 2016. 
  Loss before taxes for our Canada segment decreased   $1.5 million   to   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due improved gross margin on active projects. Loss before taxes for our Canada segment decreased   $5.8 million  , or   79.9%  , to   $1.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015   primarily due to a reserve in 2015 for potential future losses on the significant project described above as well as improved gross margin on active projects, partially offset by $1.9 million of bad debt expense recorded during the second quarter of 2016. 
  Small-Scale Infrastructure 

Revenues for our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment increased   $5.8 million  , or   36.0%  , to   $21.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and increased   $15.6 million  , or   33.9%  , to   $61.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015  , primarily due to the active development of a small-scale plant we are constructing for a customer during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of 2015 where no similar projects were in development. 
  Income before taxes for our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment increased   $3.1 million  , or   141.0%  , to   $5.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to the increase in revenues described above. Income before taxes for our Small-Scale Infrastructure segment increased   $5.4 million  , or   117.9%  , to   $9.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the increase in revenues described above.

Revenues not allocated to segments and presented as All Other decreased   $4.2 million  , or   20.2%  , to   $16.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and decreased   $10.2 million  , or   16.6%  , to   $51.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015   primarily due to our anticipated decrease in integrated-PV sales as a result of a weakening of sales to customers for oilfield microgrid applications. 
  Loss before taxes not allocated to segments and presented as all other decreased   $1.4 million   to   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and decreased   $3.8 million  , or   79.7%  , to a loss of   $1.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015   primarily due to the positive impact of our 2015 restructuring efforts including cost savings realized in our software group. 
  Unallocated corporate activity includes all corporate level selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses not allocated to the segments. We do not allocate any indirect expenses to the segments. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Sources of liquidity.    Since inception, we have funded operations primarily through cash flow from operations, advances from Federal ESPC projects and various forms of debt. We believe that available cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving senior secured credit facility, combined with our access to credit markets, will be sufficient to fund our operations through   2016   and thereafter. 
  Proceeds from our Federal ESPC projects are generally received through agreements to sell the ESPC receivables related to certain ESPC contracts to third-party investors. We use the advances from the investors under these agreements to finance the projects. Until recourse to us ceases for the ESPC receivables transferred to the investor, upon final acceptance of the work by the government customer, we are the primary obligor for financing received. The transfers of receivables under these agreements do not qualify for sales accounting until final customer acceptance of the work, so the advances from the investors are not classified as operating cash flows. Cash draws that we receive under these ESPC agreements are recorded as financing cash inflows. The use of the cash received under these arrangements to pay project costs is classified as operating cash flows. Due to the manner in which the ESPC contracts with the third-party investors are structured, our reported operating cash flows are materially impacted by the fact that operating cash flows only reflect the ESPC contract expenditure outflows and do not reflect any inflows from the corresponding contract revenues. Upon acceptance of the project by the federal customer the ESPC receivable and corresponding ESPC liability are removed from our consolidated balance sheet as a non-cash settlement. See Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Our service offering also includes the development, construction and operation of small-scale renewable energy plants. Small-scale renewable energy projects, or project assets, can either be developed for the portfolio of assets that we own and operate or designed and built for customers. Expenditures related to projects that we own are recorded as cash outflows from investing activities. Expenditures related to projects that we build for customers are recorded as cash outflows from operating activities as cost of revenues.  
  The amount of interest capitalized relating to construction financing during the period of construction for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.6 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively.

Cash flows from operating activities.   Operating activities used   $47.4 million   of net cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During that period, we had net income of   $8.6 million  , which is net of non-cash compensation, depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss and other non-cash items totaling   $24.6 million  . Decreases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, net, project development costs and an increase in income taxes payable provided   $21.8 million  . These were offset by increases in restricted cash, accounts receivable, including retainage, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets and decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities, which used   $19.0 million   in cash. Increases in Federal ESPC receivables used an additional   $83.4 million  . As described above, Federal ESPC operating cash flows only reflect the ESPC expenditure outflows and do not reflect any inflows from the corresponding contract revenues, which are recorded as cash inflows from financing activities due to the timing of the receipt of cash related to the assignment of the ESPC receivables to the third-party investors. 
     Operating activities used   $32.6 million   of net cash during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . During that period, we had net income of   $2.0 million  , which is net of non-cash compensation, depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss and other non-cash items totaling   $18.1 million  . Increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and income taxes payable provided   $26.1 million   in cash. These were offset by increases in restricted cash, accounts receivable, including retainage, inventory, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, net, prepaid expenses and other current assets, project development costs and other assets and a decrease in other liabilities, which used   $28.2 million  . An increase in Federal ESPC receivables used an additional   $50.6 million  . 
  Cash flows from investing activities.   Cash flows from investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   used   $47.9 million  . We invested   $45.2 million   on purchases of project assets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We plan to invest an additional   $25 million   to   $40 million   on capital expenditures, principally for renewable energy plants, for the remainder of 2016. In addition, we invested   $2.7 million   in purchases of other property and equipment. 
     Cash flows from investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   used   $30.1 million  . Development of our renewable energy plants used   $29.9 million  . In addition, we invested   $1.0 million   in purchases of other property and equipment and received   $0.9 million   from the sale of assets. 
  Cash flows from financing activities.   Cash flows from financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   provided   $92.8 million  . This was primarily due to proceeds from redeemable non-controlling interest of   $6.5 million  ,   $3.0 million   of restricted cash released into operating cash,   $17.0 million   received under our sale-leaseback financing arrangement, proceeds from project financings of   $7.8 million  , net draws on our revolving credit facility of   $7.5 million   and proceeds from exercises of options of   $1.0 million  . This was partially offset by payments on long-term debt of   $9.2 million  , repurchase of stock of   $4.5 million  , including fees, and payments of financing fees of   $1.3 million  . Proceeds from Federal ESPC projects provided   $65.1 million  . 
  Cash flows from financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   provided   $58.5 million  . This was primarily due to   $7.6 million   received under our sale-leaseback financing arrangement, proceeds from project financings of   $4.6 million   and proceeds from exercises of options of   $0.6 million  . These was partially offset by payments on long-term debt of   $9.1 million  , net repayments on our revolving credit facility of   $5.0 million   and payments of financing fees of   $1.9 million  . Proceeds from Federal ESPC projects provided   $61.8 million  . 
  Senior Secured Credit Facility       Revolver and Term Loan 
  On   June 30, 2015  , we entered into a third amended and restated bank credit facility with two banks. The new credit facility replaces and extended our existing credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in accordance with its terms on June 30, 2016. The revolving credit facility matures on June 30, 2020 and the term loan facility matures on June 30, 2018, when all amounts will be due and payable in full. We expect to use the new credit facility for our general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions, refinancing of existing indebtedness and working capital. In July 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the third amended and restated bank credit facility.  Under this amendment, the requirement of the total funded debt to EBITDA ratio was amended as described below. 
  The credit facility consists of a   $60.0 million   revolving credit facility and a   $17.1 million   term loan. The amount of the term loan represents the amount outstanding under our existing term loan at closing. The revolving credit facility may be increased by up to an additional   $25.0 million   at our option if lenders are willing to provide such increased commitments, subject to certain conditions. Up to   $20.0 million   of the revolving credit facility may be borrowed in Canadian dollars, Euros

and Pounds Sterling. We are the sole borrower under the credit facility. The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of all of our and such of our subsidiary guarantors  assets, other than the equity interests of certain subsidiaries and assets held in non-core subsidiaries (as defined in the agreement). At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $18.7 million   borrowings outstanding and   $41.3 million   available under the revolving credit facility and   $10.0 million   outstanding under the term loan. 
  The interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility is based on, at our option, either (1) a base rate equal to a margin of   0.50%   or   0.25%  , depending on our ratio of Total Funded Debt to EBITDA (each as defined in the agreement), over the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate, plus   0.50%  , (b) Bank of America s prime rate and (c) a rate based on the London interbank deposit rate ( LIBOR ) plus   1.50%  , or (2) the one-, two- three- or six-month LIBOR plus a margin of   2.00%   or   1.75%  , depending on our ratio of Total Funded Debt to EBITDA. A commitment fee of   0.375%   is payable quarterly on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was   3.75%   and interest rate for borrowings under the term loan was   2.59%  .  
  The revolving credit facility does not require amortization of principal. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of   $1.4 million  , with the balance due at maturity. All borrowings may be paid before maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium, other than reimbursement of any breakage and deployment costs in the case of LIBOR borrowings. 
  The credit facility limits our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; incur liens or guarantee obligations; merge, liquidate or dispose of assets; make acquisitions or other investments; enter into hedging agreements; pay dividends and make other distributions and engage in transactions with affiliates, except in the ordinary course of business on an arms  length basis. 
  Under the credit facility, we may not invest cash or property in, or loan to, our non-core subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding   49%   of our consolidated stockholders  equity. In addition, under the credit facility, we and our core subsidiaries must maintain the following financial covenants:   

  Any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of the credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, permitting the lenders to, among other things, accelerate the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, under the credit facility, to terminate the credit facility, and enforce liens against the collateral. 
  The credit facility also includes several other customary events of default, including a change in control, permitting the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness, terminate the credit facility, and enforce liens against the collateral. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the financial and operational covenants in the senior credit facility. In addition, we do not consider it likely that we will fail to comply with these covenants for the next twelve months.  
  Project Financing 
  Construction and Term Loans.   We have entered into a number of construction and term loan agreements for the purpose of constructing and owning certain renewable energy plants. The physical assets and the operating agreements related to the renewable energy plants are owned by wholly owned, single member special purpose subsidiaries. These construction and term loans are structured as project financings made directly to a subsidiary, and upon acceptance of a project, the related construction loan converts into a term loan. While we are required under GAAP to reflect these loans as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, they are generally nonrecourse and not direct obligations of Ameresco, Inc. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $91.0 million   in aggregate principal amount under these loans with maturities at various dates from   2017   to   2031  . Effective interest rates, after consideration for our interest rate swap contracts, ranged from   4.7%   to   7.3%  .

In September 2015, the Company entered into a credit and guaranty agreement for use in providing non-recourse financing for certain of its solar-PV projects currently under construction. The credit and guaranty agreement provides for a   $20.7 million   construction-to-term loan credit facility and bears interest at a variable rate. On March 30, 2016, the construction loan was converted to a term loan. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $20.6 million   was outstanding under the term loan. The variable rate for this loan at   September 30, 2016   was   3.3%  . 
  One loan with an outstanding balance as of   September 30, 2016   totaling   $2.8 million  , requires Ameresco, Inc. to provide assurance to the lender of the project performance. A second loan, entered into during 2012, with an outstanding balance as of   September 30, 2016   of   $36.4 million   requires Ameresco, Inc. to provide assurance to the lender of reimbursement upon any recapture of certain renewable energy Government cash grants upon the occurrence of events that cause the recapture of such grants. As of December 31,   2015  , we had outstanding   $87.5 million   in aggregate principal amount under these loans. Effective interest rates, after consideration for our interest rate swap contracts, ranged from   2.8%   to   7.3%  . These loans mature at various dates from   2017   to   2028  . 
  These construction and term loan agreements require us to comply with a variety of financial and operational covenants. As of   September 30, 2016   we were in compliance with all of these financial and operational covenants. In addition, we do not consider it likely that we will fail to comply with these covenants during the term of these agreements. 
  Federal ESPC Liabilities.   We have arrangements with certain lenders to provide advances to us during the construction or installation of projects for certain customers, typically federal governmental entities, in exchange for our assignment to the lenders of our rights to the long-term receivables arising from the ESPCs related to such projects. These financings totaled   $108.0 million   and   $122.0 million   in principal amounts at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively. Under the terms of these financing arrangements, we are required to complete the construction or installation of the project in accordance with the contract with our customer, and the debt remains on our consolidated balance sheets until the completed project is accepted by the customer.

Sale-Leaseback.   During the first quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement with an investor which gives us the option to sell and contemporaneously lease back solar photovoltaic ( solar-PV ) projects. In September 2016, we amended our agreement with the investor whereas the investor has committed up to a maximum combined funding amount of   $100,000   through June 30, 2017 on certain projects. As of   September 30, 2016  , $70.5 million remained available under the lending commitment. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold one solar-PV project and in return received   $6.0 million   as part of this arrangement. No solar-PV projects were sold during the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . While we are required under GAAP to reflect these lease payments as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, they are generally nonrecourse and not direct obligations of Ameresco, Inc., except that Ameresco, Inc. has guaranteed certain obligations relating to taxes and project warranties, operation and maintenance. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1 
    ) 
      
    Federal ESPC arrangements relate to the installation and construction of projects for certain customers, typically federal governmental entities, where we assign to the third-party lenders our right to customer receivables. We are relieved of the liability when the project is completed and accepted by the customer. We typically expect to be relieved of the liability between one and three years from the date of project construction commencement. The table does not include, for our Federal ESPC liability arrangements, the difference between the aggregate amount of the long-term customer receivables sold by us to the lender and the amount received by us from the lender for such sale.

    For both the revolver and term loan portion of our senior secured credit facility, the table above assumes that the variable interest rate in effect at September 30, 2016 remains constant for the term of the facility. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet. 
   
  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no significant changes in market risk exposures that materially affected the quantitative and qualitative disclosures as described in Item 7A to our Annual Report. 
   
  Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, or the evaluation date. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the

     Table of Contents  

Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the evaluation date, concluded that as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance.

AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  
  This AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT is dated as of July 27, 2016 (this    Amendment   ), among                   AMERESCO, INC.

  WHEREAS, the Loan Parties, the Lenders, and the Agent are parties to that certain Third Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement dated as of June 30, 2015, as heretofore     amended, among the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Lenders, and the Agent (as amended,                           restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the    Credit Agreement    
  WHEREAS, the Loan Parties, the Agent and the Lenders wish to revise certain                            provisions of the Credit Agreement, as described herein;  
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the agreements contained                herein, the parties agree that the Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows: 
  1.  Capitalized Terms  .  Except as otherwise expressly defined herein, all capitalized            terms used herein which are defined in the Credit Agreement have the same meanings herein as            therein, except to the extent that such meanings are amended hereby. 
  2.      Amendment to Credit Agreement  .  Section 9.10(a) of the Credit Agreement is                  hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 
  (a)      Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio  .  The Loan Parties shall not permit                      the Core Leverage Ratio (i) as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending on or before                           June 30, 2016, to exceed 2.00 to 1.00, (ii) as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending    September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, to exceed                 2.75 to 1.00, and (iii) as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and  thereafter, to exceed 2.00 to 1.00.
