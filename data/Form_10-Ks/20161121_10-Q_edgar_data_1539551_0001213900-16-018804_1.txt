TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   (Unaudited)   

NOTE
1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

Sports
Field Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ,  Sports Field Holdings ,  we ,  our , or
 us ) is a Nevada corporation engaged in product development, engineering, manufacturing, and the construction, design
and building of athletic facilities, as well as supplying its own proprietary high end synthetic turf products to the sports industry.   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management,
such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the condensed financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year
ending December 31, 2016 or any other period.  

These
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and for the year then ended, which were filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) on Form 10-K on April 12, 2016.  

NOTE
2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sports Field Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s significant
estimates and assumptions include the accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts, percentage of completion revenue recognition
method, the useful life of fixed assets and assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation.  

Revenues
and Cost Recognition   

Revenues
from construction contracts are included in contract revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and are recognized
under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. The percent complete is measured by the cost incurred to date compared to
the estimated total cost of each project. This method is used as management considers expended cost to be the best available measure
of progress on these contracts, the majority of which are completed within one year, but may occasionally extend beyond one year.
Inherent uncertainties in estimating costs make it at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the
near term and over the life of the contracts.  

Contract
costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance and completion. Provisions
for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. General and administrative
costs are charged to expense as incurred.  

Changes
in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final
contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income. Such revisions are recognized in the period in which they are
determined.  

Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings are comprised principally of revenue recognized on contracts (on the percentage-of-completion
method) for which billings had not been presented to customers because the amounts were not billable under the contract terms
at the balance sheet date. In accordance with the contract terms, any unbilled receivables at period end will be billed subsequently.
Amounts are billed based on contractual terms. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent billings in excess
of revenues recognized.   

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the company did not have any cash equivalents.  

Property,
Plant and Equipment   

Property,
plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from 3 to 5 years. Gains and
losses from the retirement or disposition of property and equipment are included in operations in the period incurred. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is
generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value
amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually
the vesting period. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.   

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

Financial
instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash
and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with credit quality institutions. At times, such
amounts may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.  

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

Accounts
receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company generally does not require
collateral to support customer receivables. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the
outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection information and existing economic conditions. The Company determines if
receivables are past due based on days outstanding, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible by management.
The maximum accounting loss from the credit risk associated with accounts receivable is the amount of the receivable recorded,
which is the face amount of the receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company s accounts receivable balance was $14,704 and $151,168, respectively, and the allowance for doubtful
accounts is $0 in each period.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
incurred research and development expenses of $0 and $0, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company incurred research and development expenses of $88,447 and $0, respectively.  

Warranty
Costs   

The
Company generally provides a warranty on the products installed for up to 8 years with certain limitations and exclusions based
upon the manufacturer s product warranty; therefore the Company does not believe a warranty reserve is required as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Accounting
Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) requires disclosure of the fair value
of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized
or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future
cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.  

Beneficial
Conversion Feature   

For
conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records a  beneficial conversion
feature  ( BCF ) and related debt discount.  

When
the Company records a BCF the relative fair value of the BCF would be recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the
respective debt instrument. The debt discount attributable to the BCF is amortized over the period from issuance to the date that
the debt matures.  

Derivative
Instruments   

The
Company evaluates its convertible debt, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of
those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-15. The result of this accounting
treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.
In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statements of operations
as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at
the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.  

In
circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also
other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative
instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.  

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject
to reclassification are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Common Share   

The
Company computes basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) per share available to common stockholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities.
Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially
dilutive securities into common stock using the  treasury stock  and/or  if converted  methods as applicable.
The computation of basic and diluted loss per share excludes potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.  Anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are as follows:  

Shares
outstanding    

Shares
outstanding include shares of unvested restricted stock. Unvested restricted stock included in reportable shares outstanding was
217,593 and 0 shares as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Shares of unvested restricted stock are excluded from our
calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding, but their dilutive impact is added back in the calculation of diluted
weighted average shares outstanding.  

Significant
Customers   

The
Company s business focuses on securing a smaller number of high quality, highly profitable projects, which sometimes results
in having a concentration of sales and accounts receivable among a few customers. This concentration is customary among the design
and build industry for a company of our size. As we continue to grow and are awarded more projects, this concentration will continue
to decrease.   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had one customer representing 100.0% of the total accounts receivable balance.   

At
December 31, 2015, the Company had two customers representing 94% of the total accounts receivable balance.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had four customers that represented 10%, 17%, 28%, and 43% of the total
revenue and for the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had three customers that represented 14%, 62% and 23% of
the total revenue.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had five customers that represented 15%, 33%, 17%, 11% and 15% of the total
revenue and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had four customers that represented 18%, 28%, 39%, and 13%
of the total revenue.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
items in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  

Recently
Adopted Accounting Guidance   

In
April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , or ASU 2015-03. ASU 2015-03 amends current presentation guidance by requiring that
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were
required to be presented as an asset in the balance sheet. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 and prior
period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. As of December 31, 2015, $23,037 of debt
issuance costs were reclassified in the condensed consolidated balance sheet from current assets to convertible notes payable.
The adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not materially impact our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.   

In
June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12,   Compensation-Stock
Compensation  . The amendments in this update apply to reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments
in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period. This Accounting
Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update EITF-13D-Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after
the Requisite Service Period, which has been deleted. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting
and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should
apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such
awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation
cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent
the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance
target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation
cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized
during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted
to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service
and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. As indicated in the definition of vest, the
stated vesting period (which includes the period in which the performance target could be achieved) may differ from the requisite
service period. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted.  We adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-12 on January
1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not impact our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.  

Recent
Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted   

During
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which
requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The new
guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to
obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to the first
quarter of 2018 to provide companies sufficient time to implement the standards. Early Adoption will be permitted, but not before
the first quarter of 2017. Adoption can occur using one of two prescribed transition methods. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the new standard.   

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,   Presentation of
Financial Statements-Going Concern.   The Update provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating
whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures.
For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are
issued. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2013-300-Presentation of
Financial Statements (Topic 205): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Going Concern Presumption, which has been
deleted. The amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.  

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-02,  Leases  (topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.
2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging  (topic 815). The FASB issued this update to clarify the requirements for assessing
whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely
related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this update is required to assess the
embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. The updated guidance is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.
2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (topic 718). The FASB issued this update to improve the accounting
for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b)
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  (topic 606).
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross verses
Net)  (topic 606). These amendments provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued
ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on
materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct performance obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs;
and determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use an entity's intellectual
property or a right to access an entity's intellectual property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity should identify
the specified good or service for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain
types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an entity's adoption of ASU 2014-09, which
we intend to adopt for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of the new standard.  

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   ASU No. 2016-15
addresses specific cash flow classification issues where there is currently diversity in practice including debt prepayment and
proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

There
were no other new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective since the issuance of our 2015 Annual Report
on Form 10-K that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.   

Subsequent
Events   

Management
has evaluated subsequent events or transactions occurring through the date on which the financial statements were issued.
Based upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required
adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed.  

NOTE
3   GOING CONCERN   

As reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2016 the Company had a working capital deficit of $(1,952,354). Furthermore,
the Company had a net loss and net cash used in operations of $(2,882,280) and $(2,026,048), respectively, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and an accumulated deficit totaling $(13,151,798). These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability of the Company to continue its operations as a going concern is dependent on Management's plans, which include the raising
of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including
but not limited to term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.  

The
Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve
its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient
to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable
to the Company, if at all.  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Warranty
Costs   

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 the Company incurred costs of approximately $103,600 and $121,000, respectively. A substantial amount of the warranty
costs incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to subgrade infill materials used on a 2015 project.
Since then, neither this supplier nor this infill material has been used again. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015 the Company incurred costs of approximately $21,863 and $227,863, respectively, relating to the installation of materials
by a subcontractor that has been released from the Company. The Company has implemented policies and procedures to avoid these
costs in the future. The Company generally provides a warranty on the products installed for up to 8 years with certain limitations
and exclusions based upon the manufacturer s product warranty; therefore, the Company does not believe a warranty reserve
is required as of September 30, 2016.

NOTE
6   DEBT   

Convertible
Notes   

On
May 7, 2015, the Company issued unsecured convertible promissory notes (each a  Note  and collectively the
 Notes ) in an aggregate principal amount of $450,000 to three accredited investors (collectively the  Note
Holders ) through a private placement. The notes pay interest equal to 9% of the principal amount of the notes, payable
in one lump sum, and mature on February 1, 2016 unless the notes are converted into common stock if the Company undertakes a
qualified offering of securities of at least $2,000,000 (the  Qualified Offering ). The principal of the notes
are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price that is the lower of $1.00 per share or the price per share
offered in a Qualified Offering. In order to induce the investors to invest in the notes, one of the Company s
shareholders assigned an aggregate of 45,000 shares of his common stock to such investors. The Company recorded a $45,000
debt discount relating to the 45,000 shares of common stock issued with an offsetting entry to additional paid in capital.
The debt discount shall be amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes. As part of the transaction, we incurred
placement agent fees of $22,500 and legal fees of $22,500 which were recorded as debt issue costs and shall be amortized over
the life of the notes. The outstanding principal balance on the notes at December 31, 2015 was $450,000.  

The
notes matured on February 1, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the Note Holders entered into a letter agreement whereby, effective as of
February 1, 2016, they waived any and all defaults that may or may not have occurred prior to the date thereof (the  First
Waiver ). As consideration for the First Waiver, the Company issued the Note Holders an aggregate of 45,000 shares of the
Company s common stock. The principal amount on the Notes increased from $450,000 to $490,500 as the initial interest amount,
$40,500 as of February 1, 2016, was added to the principal amount of the Notes. The maturity date of the Notes was extended to
July 1, 2016 and the Notes shall pay interest as of February 1, 2016 at a rate of 9% per annum, payable in one lump sum on the
maturity date. In addition, on any note conversion date from February 1, 2016 through July 1, 2016, the Notes are convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. On any Note conversion after July 1,
2016, the Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price that is the lower of (i)
$1.00 per share and (ii) the volume-weighted average price for the last five trading days preceding the conversion date. All remaining
terms of the Notes remained the same.  

Subsequent to the First Waiver, the
Notes matured on July 1, 2016. On September 7, 2016, one Note Holder entered into a letter agreement whereby, effective as of August
1, 2016, they waived any and all defaults that may or may not have occurred prior to the date thereof (the  Second Waiver ).
As consideration for the Second Waiver, the Company issued the Note Holder an aggregate of 40,000 shares of the Company s
common stock and added $15,000 to the principal amount of the note. The principal amount on the Note increased from $218,000 to
$242,810 as the accrued interest amount, $9,810 as of August 1, 2016 and the aforementioned $15,000 of consideration, was added
to the principal amount of the Note. The maturity date of the Note was extended to January 1, 2017 and the Note shall pay interest
as of August 1, 2016 at a rate of 15% per annum, payable in one lump sum on the maturity date. In addition, on any note conversion
date from August 9, 2016 through January 1, 2017, the Note is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a
conversion price of $1.00 per share. On any Note conversion after January 1, 2017, the Note is convertible into shares of the Company s
common stock at a conversion price that is the lower of (i) $1.00 per share and (ii) the volume-weighted average price for the
last five trading days preceding the conversion date. All remaining terms of the Note remained the same. 

On October 21, 2016, a second Note Holder entered into a letter agreement whereby, effective as of August
1, 2016, they waived any and all defaults that may or may not have occurred prior to the date thereof (the  Second Waiver ).
As consideration for the Second Waiver, the Company issued the Note Holder an aggregate of 30,000 shares of the Company s
common stock. The principal amount on the Note increased from $163,500 to $170,858 as the accrued interest amount, $7,358 as of
August 1, 2016, was added to the principal amount of the Note. The maturity date of the Note was extended to January 1, 2017 and
the Note shall pay interest as of August 1, 2016 at a rate of 15% per annum, payable in one lump sum on the maturity date. In
addition, on any note conversion date from August 9, 2016 through January 1, 2017, the Note is convertible into shares of the
Company s common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. On any Note conversion after January 1, 2017, the Note
is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price that is the lower of (i) $1.00 per share
and (ii) the volume-weighted average price for the last five trading days preceding the conversion date. All remaining terms of
the Note remained the same. 

Glenn
Tilley, a director of the Company, is the holder of $163,500 of principal as of September 30, 2016 of the aforementioned Notes.  

As of July 1, 2016, the Company was not compliant
with the repayment terms of one of the Notes but no defaults under the Note have been called by the Note Holder. As September
30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance on the Note was $109,000. The Company is currently conducting good faith negotiations
with the Note Holder to further extend the maturity date, however, there can be no assurance that a further extension will be
granted. The Company is currently accruing interest on the Note at the default interest rate of 15% per annum. 

First
Waiver   

In
accordance with ASC 470, since the present value of the cash flows under the new debt instrument was not at least ten percent
different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original debt instrument, the Company accounted
for the First Waiver as a debt modification. Accordingly, the Company recorded a debt discount of $49,500 in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet. The debt discount shall be amortized to interest expense over the life of the note.  

Second
Waiver   

In
accordance with ASC 470, since the present value of the cash flows under the new debt instrument was at least ten percent different
from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original debt instrument, the Company accounted for
the Second Waiver as a debt extinguishment. Accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $35,400 in the
condensed consolidated statement of operations.  

The Company assessed
the conversion feature of the Note in default at the end of the reporting period and concluded the conversion feature of the Note
did not qualify as a derivative because there is no market mechanism for net settlement and it is not readily convertible to cash.
The Company will reassess the conversion feature of the Note for derivative treatment at the end of each subsequent reporting period. 

On
August 19, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a private investor (the  Investor ).
Under the Agreement, the Investor agreed to purchase convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of up to $450,000
(together the  Debentures  and each individual issuance a  Debenture ), bearing interest at a rate of
0% per annum, with maturity on the thirty-six (36) month anniversary of the respective date of issuance.  

On
the Initial Closing Date, we issued and sold to the Investor, and the Investor purchased from us, a first Debenture in the principal
amount of $150,000 for a purchase price of $135,000. $15,000 was recorded as an original issue discount and will be accreted over
the life of the note to interest expense. The Agreement provides that, subject to our compliance with certain conditions to closing,
at the request of the Company and approval by the Investor, (i) we will issue and sell to the Investor, and the Investor will
purchase from us, a second Debenture in the principal amount of $150,000 for a purchase price of $135,000 and (ii) thereafter,
we will issue and sell to the Investor, and the Investor will purchase from us, a third Debenture in the principal amount of $150,000
for a purchase price of $135,000.   

The
principal amount of the Debentures can be converted at the option of the Investor into shares of our common stock at a conversion
price per share of $1.00 until the six month anniversary of each closing date.  If the Debenture is not repaid within six
months, the Investor will be able to convert such Debenture at a conversion price equal to 65% of the lowest closing bid price
for our common stock during the previous 20 trading days, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Debenture. If the
Debentures are repaid within 90 days of the date of issuance, there is no prepayment penalty or premium.  Following such
time, a prepayment penalty or premium will apply.  As part of the transaction, we agreed to pay the Investor $5,000 and issue
25,000 shares of our Common Stock for certain due diligence and other transaction related costs. In-addition the Company incurred
placement agent fees of $7,500 and legal fees of $7,500. The Company recorded a $25,000 debt discount relating to the 25,000 shares
of common stock issued. The debt discount shall be amortized to interest expense over the life of the note. The remaining fees
were recorded as debt issue costs and shall be amortized over the life of the note.  

The
Company assessed the conversion feature of the Debentures on the date of issuance and at end of each subsequent reporting period
and concluded the conversion feature of the Debentures do not qualify as a derivative because there is no market mechanism for
net settlement and it is not readily convertible to cash. The Company will reassess the conversion feature of the Debentures for
derivative treatment at the end of each subsequent reporting period.   

The
outstanding principal balance on the Debentures at December 31, 2015 was $150,000. On February 19, 2016, the Company paid the
Debentures in full along with a prepayment penalty in the amount of $45,000.  

On February 22, 2016 (the  Effective
Date ), the Company issued a convertible note in the principal aggregate amount of $170,000 to a private investor. The note
pays interest at a rate of 12% per annum and matures on August 19, 2016 (the  Maturity Date ). The Note is convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to: (i) from the Effective Date through the Maturity
Date at $1.00 per share; and (ii) beginning one day after the Maturity Date, or notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after
the Company has registered shares of its common stock underlying the Note in a registration statement on Form S-1 or any other
form applicable thereto, the lower of i) $1.00 per share and ii) 60% of the volume-weighted average price for the last twenty
trading days preceding the conversion date. 

The
Company used the proceeds of the note to pay off a debenture issued in favor of a private investor on August 19, 2015. The debenture
was in the principal amount of $150,000 and as of the date of this filing the investor has been paid all principal and interest
due in full satisfaction thereof.  

As additional consideration for issuing
the note, on the Effective Date the Company issued to the investor 35,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock.
The Company recorded a $30,637 debt discount relating to the 35,000 shares of common stock issued. The debt discount was amortized
to interest expense over the life of the convertible note. 

The intrinsic value of the convertible
note, when issued, gave rise to a beneficial conversion feature which was recorded as a discount to the note of $67,637 and was
amortized over the period from issuance to the date that the debt matured. 

The Company assessed
the conversion feature of the note on the date of issuance, on the date of default and at the end of each subsequent reporting
period and concluded the conversion feature of the note did not qualify as a derivative because there is no market mechanism for
net settlement and it is not readily convertible to cash. The Company will reassess the conversion feature of the note for derivative
treatment at the end of each subsequent reporting period. 

The outstanding principal balance on
the convertible note at September 30, 2016 was $170,000. 

As of August 19, 2016, the Company is not
compliant with the repayment terms of this note but no defaults under the note have been called by the note holder. The Company
is currently conducting good faith negotiations with the note holder to further extend the maturity date, however, there can be
no assurance that a further extension will be granted. The Company recorded $17,850 in penalty interest during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the default. Accrued interest on this note is $18,525 as of September 30, 2016.

option pricing model to options granted, the Company used the following weighted average assumptions:  

Since
the Company has limited trading history, volatility was determined by averaging volatilities of comparable companies.  

The
expected term of the option, taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees  expected
exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the
period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1, it may be appropriate
to use the  simplified method  ,  i.e., expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)  , if (i) A
company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due

financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

Sports
Field Holdings, Inc. (the  Company  or  Sports Field ), through its wholly owned subsidiary FirstForm,
Inc. (formerly SportsField Engineering, Inc.,  FirstForm ), is an innovative product development company engaged in
the design, engineering and construction of athletic fields, facilities and sports complexes and the sale of customized synthetic
turf products and synthetic track systems.  

According
to Applied Market Information (AMI), over 2,000 athletic field projects were constructed in the U.S. in 2015, creating
a $1.8 billion synthetic turf market. These statistics are supported by the number of square meters of synthetic turf manufactured
and installed in the U.S. in 2015 based on an average size of 80,000 sqft per project. We believe synthetic turf fields have become
the field of choice for public and private schools, municipal parks and recreation departments, non-profit and for profit sports
venue businesses, residential and commercial landscaping and golf related venues. We believe this is due to the spiraling costs
associated with maintaining natural grass athletic fields and the demand for increased playing time, durability of the playing
surface and the ability to play on that surface in any weather conditions.  

Although
synthetic turf athletic fields and synthetic turf have become a viable alternative to natural grass fields, there are a number
of technical and environmental issues that have arisen through the evolution of the development of turf and the systems designed
around its installation. Sports Field has focused on addressing the main technical issues that still remain with synthetic turf
athletic fields and synthetic turf including but not limited to environmental and safety concerns related to infill used in synthetic
turf fields as well the reduction of surface heat, Gmax levels (the measure of how much force the surface absorbs and in return,
how much is returned to the athlete) as well drainage issues related to the base construction of a turf installation.  

In
addition to increased need for available playing space, collegiate athletic facilities have become an attractive recruiting tool
for many institutions. The competition for athletes and recruiting has resulted in a multitude of projects to build new or upgrade
existing facilities. These facilities projects include indoor fields, bleachers, press boxes, lighting, concession stands as well
as locker rooms and gymnasiums. We believe that our position in the sports facilities design, construction and turf sales industry
allows us to benefit from this spending because we are able to compete for sale of the turf as well as the design and construction
revenue on such projects, whereas our competitors can typically only compete for the turf components or the construction revenue,
but not all three. In fact, according to a current IBIS report, there are no national firms competing in these sectors that have
even 5% market share.  

Through
our strategic operations design, we have the ability to operate throughout the U.S. and provide high quality synthetic turf systems
focused on player safety and performance and construct those facilities for our clients using a single partner. Due to our ability
to design, estimate, engineer, general contract and install our solutions, we can spend more of every owner dollar on product
rather than margin and overhead, thereby delivering a premium product at market rates for our customers. Since inception we have
completed a variety of projects from the design, engineering and build of entire football stadiums to the installation of a specialized
turf track systems. Our team has also designed, engineered and installed baseball stadiums, soccer and lacrosse fields, indoor
soccer facilities, softball fields and running tracks and for private sports venues, public and private high schools and public
and private universities. In addition, we have designed and engineered and constructed concession stands with full kitchen facilities,
restroom structures, press boxes, baseball dugouts, bleacher seating, ticket booths, locker room facilities and gymnasium expansion
projects.  

During
fiscal 2016, the Company has completed some very important projects and initiatives including the completion of a lacrosse/soccer
field at IMG Academy in Bradenton, FL ( IMG ).  In addition to creating a very important reference site, we have
also built out a series of research and development plots to allow for continuous product trials and development opportunities
at IMG.   

Additionally,
our largest facilities design build project to date is currently underway at in Staten Island,
NY. With the design and engineering portions of the project completed we will be moving into phase two construction during the
third and fourth quarter of 2016.  We believe that this project will represent a new benchmark for our facilities construction
capabilities.  

Furthermore,
we maintain a number of contracts for projects that were originally slated to commence in the third quarter of 2016. However,
due to mobilization delays, these projects and revenue related to such projects, will be realized beginning in the fourth quarter.    

Summary
of Statements of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenue    

Revenue was $669,953 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2,092,083 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,948,511. The
substantial decrease in revenue was primarily due to contracts entered into during prior quarters winding down during the second
quarter. New contracted projects were started late in third quarter and the majority of the associated revenue will be recognized
in the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond. 

Gross
Profit (Loss)    

The
Company generated a gross profit of $98,918, resulting in a gross profit margin of 14.76%, during the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to a gross profit (loss) of $(108,191) and a gross profit margin of (5.17%), during the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Gross profit percentage increased from (5.17%) for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 14.76% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in overall estimated profit margins on jobs entered into subsequent
to June 30, 2015. During the prior period projects were bid at lower than current acceptable margins in order to place fields
in certain strategic geographic locations that the Company believed could be used as a marketing tool in the future.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our facilities,
finance, human resources, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal,
audit, marketing, investor relations and outsourcing services.  

Operating
expenses increased by 4% during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. The overall $26,730 increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following approximate net increases
(decreases) in operating expenses:  

A
    decrease in stock based compensation expense of $67,000. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fair value of the
    Company s common stock during the current period. Unvested equity awards granted to consultants are revalued at the
    end of each reporting period until they vest and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.   

An
    increase in professional fees of $40,000 (excluding stock based compensation). In the current period the Company incurred
    an increase in in consulting fees related to business development and sales consultants along with increases in fees for investor
    relations and accounting and auditing fees. These increases were partially offset by decrease in legal fees and financial
    advisory service fees.    

A
    decrease in travel and travel related expenses of $38,000 as a result of decreased sales and project management travel expenses.   

An
    increase in warranty expenses of $82,000. During the current period the Company incurred warranty costs primarily relating
    to faulty materials installed on a job completed in a prior period.    

Other
Income (Expenses)    

Other
income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense related to the Company s notes payable.  

Other
income (expenses), net for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were $(150,597), as compared to $(31,701) for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 other income (expenses) consisted of $(135,764)
in interest expense, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $(35,400) and miscellaneous income of $20,567. For the three months ended
September 30, 2015 other income (expenses) consisted of $(36,029) in interest expense and miscellaneous income of $4,328.  

Net
Loss    

The
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $(737,318), or a basic and diluted loss per share of $(0.04), as compared
to a net loss of $(798,801), or a basic and diluted loss per share of $(0.06), for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The decrease in the loss compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit partially offset
by an increase in operating expenses and increase in other income (expense) items discussed above.  

Summary
of Statements of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenue    

Revenue was $1,948,511 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,505,977 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,557,466. The
substantial decrease in revenue was primarily due to contracts entered into during prior quarters winding down during the second
quarter. New contracted projects were started late in third quarter and the majority of the associated revenue will be recognized
in the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond. 

Gross
Profit (Loss)    

The
Company generated a gross profit of $88,396, resulting in a gross profit margin of 4.54%, during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to a gross profit (loss) of $(165,387) and a gross profit margin of (4.72%), during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Gross profit percentage increased from (4.72%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.54% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in overall estimated profit margins on jobs entered into subsequent to
June 30, 2015. During the prior period projects were bid at lower than current acceptable margins in order to place fields in
certain strategic geographic locations that the Company believed could be used for the purpose of marketing its products.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our facilities,
finance, human resources, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal,
audit, marketing, investor relations and outsourcing services.  

Operating
expenses increased by 35% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The overall $659,759 increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following approximate net increases
(decreases) in operating expenses:  

An
    increase in stock based compensation expense of $636,000. The increase was primarily due to an increase in stock based awards
    issued subsequent to September 30, 2015 which are being expensed over the term of the contract. The overall increase was partially
    offset due to a decrease in fair value of the Company s common stock during the third quarter of 2016. Unvested equity
    awards granted to consultants are revalued at the end of each reporting period until they vest and are expensed on a straight-line
    basis over the term of the agreement.   

An
    increase of research and development expenses of $88,447. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred
    at our field testing sites. We expense research and development costs as incurred.   

An
    increase in professional fees of $50,000 (excluding stock based compensation). In the current period the Company incurred
    an increase in consulting fees related to business development, sales consultants and investor relations. These increases
    were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees and financial advisory service fees.   

A
    decrease in travel and travel related expenses of $67,000 as a result of decreased sales and project management travel expenses.   

A
    decrease in warranty expenses of $107,000. During the prior period the Company incurred substantial warranty costs relating
    to the faulty installation of materials by a subcontractor that has been released from the Company.   

An
    increase in advertising, marketing and marketing related expenses of $37,000. The Company is focusing on building name recognition
    in the industry.   

Other
Income (Expenses)    

Other
income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense related to the Company s notes payable.  

Other
income (expenses), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $(422,959), as compared to $(43,628) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 other income (expenses) consisted of $(408,367) in interest
expense, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $(35,400) and miscellaneous income of $20,808. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015 other income (expenses) consisted of $(47,956) in interest expense and miscellaneous income of $4,328.  

Net
Loss    

The
net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $(2,882,280), or a basic and diluted loss per share of $(0.18), as compared
to a net loss of $(2,096,973), or a basic and diluted loss per share of $(0.15), for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in the loss compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to the increase in operating expenses and increase
in other income (expense) items discussed above partially offset by an increase in gross profit.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at September 30, 2016, compared to December 31,
2015:  

At
September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $(1,952,354) as compared to working capital deficit of $(2,517,035) at
December 31, 2015, a working capital deficit decrease of $564,681. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company
received approximately $1,641,407 in net proceeds from the private placement of common stock through Spartan Capital, 150,000
in proceeds from convertible notes and $800,000 in proceeds from promissory notes. The Company used the proceeds to pay down existing
debt and vendor liabilities and to fund operations due to the Company s continued operating losses and negative cash flows
from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Summary
Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Cash
Used in Operating Activities   

Our
primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to contractors for project costs, consultants, legal and professional
fees, marketing expenses and other general corporate expenditures.  

Cash
used in operating activities consist of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, primarily equity-based compensation expense,
depreciation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on dispositions of fixed assets, amortization of debt issuance
costs and amortization of debt discount, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.  

The
adjustments for the non-cash items increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September
30, 2016 due primarily to an increase in equity-based compensation, a loss on extinguishment of debt and the amortization of debt
discount and debt issuance costs on debt agreements entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition,
the net decrease in cash from changes in working capital activities from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of a decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to a winding down of prior
quarter projects of which all outstanding invoices were collected, an increase in prepaid expenses and a decrease in accounts
payable and accrued expenses primarily due to the Company paying down vendor liabilities with the proceeds received from the private
placement of the Company s common stock along with proceeds from promissory notes during the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities   

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,073,036 and $883,493, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had the following financing transactions: i) received $150,000 in
gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and repaid $(150,000) towards convertible notes; ii) received $800,000 in
gross proceeds from the issuance of promissory notes and repaid $(323,871) in promissory notes; iii) received $1,641,407 in net
proceeds from common stock subscriptions; iv) paid $(44,500) in debt issuance costs. During the nine months ended September 30,
2015, the Company had the following financing transactions: i) received $585,000 in gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible
notes; ii) received $355,993 in gross proceeds from the issuance of promissory notes; iii) paid $(57,500) in debt issuance costs.  

Going
Concern   

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2016 the Company had a working
capital deficit of $1,952,354 and net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $2,026,048. Furthermore,
the Company incurred net losses of $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $3.3 million and $3.8 million
for years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $13.2 million at September 30, 2016.
Substantially all of our accumulated deficit has resulted from losses incurred on construction projects, costs incurred in connection
with our research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

We
expect that for the next 12 months, our operating cash burn will be approximately $2.5 million, excluding repayments of existing
debts in the aggregate amount of $1.75 million. Our cash requirements relate primarily to working capital needed to operate and
grow our business, including funding operating expenses and continued development and expansion of our products/services. Our
ability to achieve profitability and meet future liquidity needs and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including
the timing and size of awarded contracts; the timing and amount of our operating expenses; the timing and costs of working capital
needs; the timing and costs of expanding our sales team and business development opportunities, the timing and costs of developing
a marketing program; the timing and costs of warranty and other post-implementation services; the timing and costs of hiring and
training construction and administrative staff; the extent to which our brand and construction services gain market acceptance;
the extent of our ongoing and any new research and development programs; and changes in our strategy or our planned activities.  

We
have experienced and continue to experience negative cash flows from operations and we expect to continue to incur net losses
in the foreseeable future.  

The
Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve
its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient
to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable
to the Company, if at all. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan.
As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations
would be materially harmed.  

To
date, we have funded our operational short-fall primarily through private offerings of common stock, convertible notes and promissory
notes, our line of credit and factoring of receivables. The Company believes it has potential financing sources in order to raise
the capital necessary to fund operations through fiscal year end 2016.  

The
Company s recent capital raising transactions include the following:  

The
Company entered into an exclusive Financial Advisory and Investment Banking Agreement with Spartan Capital Securities, LLC ( Spartan )
effective October 1, 2015 (the  2015 Spartan Advisory Agreement ). Pursuant to the 2015 Spartan Advisory Agreement,
Spartan acted as the Company s financial advisor and placement agent and assisted the Company in connection with a best
efforts private placement (the  2015 Financing ) of up to $3.5 million or 3,181,819 shares (the  Shares )
of the common stock of the Company at $1.10 per Share. The 2015 Spartan Advisory Agreement expires on January 1, 2019.  

From
December 28, 2015 through July 22, 2016, the Company sold 1,833,377 shares common stock to accredited investors in exchange for
$2,016,712 in gross proceeds in connection with the private placement of the Company s stock.  

  In
connection with the private placement the Company incurred fees of $262,204. In addition, 183,338 five year warrants with an exercise
price of $1.10 were issued to the placement agent. The Company valued the warrants on the commitment date using a Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model. The value of the warrants was a direct cost of the private placement and has been recorded as a reduction
in additional paid in capital.  

On
July 14, 2016, the Company closed a Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) by and among the Company and FirstForm
and Genlink Capital, LLC, as lender ( Genlink ). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Genlink agreed to loan the Company
up to a maximum of $1 million for general operating expenses. An initial amount of $670,000 was funded by Genlink at the closing
of the Credit Agreement. Any increase in the amount extended to the Borrowers shall be at the discretion of Genlink.  

The
amounts borrowed pursuant to the Credit Agreement are evidenced by a Revolving Note (the  Revolving Note ) and the
repayment of the Revolving Note is secured by a first position security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets
in favor of Genlink, as evidenced by a Security Agreement by and among the Borrowers and Genlink (the  Security Agreement ).
The Revolving Note is due and payable, along with interest thereon, on December 20, 2017, and bears interest at the rate of 15%
per annum, increasing to 19% upon the occurrence of an event of default. The Company incurred loan fees of approximately $44,500
for entering into the Credit Agreement. The Company must pay a minimum of $75,000 in interest over the life of the loan. The principal
balance on the note as of the date hereof is $925,000.  

In
addition to the aforementioned current sources of capital that will provide additional short term liquidity, the Company is currently
exploring various other alternatives, including debt and equity financing vehicles, strategic partnerships, government programs
that may be available to the Company, as well as trying to generate additional sales and increase margins. However, at this time
the Company has no commitments to obtain any additional funds, and there can be no assurance such funds will be available on acceptable
terms or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding and improve its operations, the Company s financial
condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the Company may not be able to continue operations.  

Additionally,
even if we raise sufficient capital through additional equity or debt financing, strategic alternatives or otherwise, there can
be no assurances that the revenue or capital infusion will be sufficient to enable us to develop our business to a level where
it will be profitable or generate positive cash flow. The Company has begun work on its currently contracted jobs and anticipates
recognizing that revenue and increasing its gross margin on these current projects, however, there can be no assurance that higher
sales volume and increasing margins will indefinitely continue into the foreseeable future.  

If
we incur additional debt, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest
on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. The terms of any debt securities issued could
also impose significant restrictions on our operations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price
of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and may adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds.  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its total liabilities of $3.2 million
at September 30, 2016, and to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of future funding, continued growth
in sales along with increased profitability on sales. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of these uncertainties.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.    

Revenue
and Cost Recognition   

Revenues
from construction contracts are included in contract revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and are recognized
under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. The percent complete is measured by the cost incurred to date compared to
the estimated total cost of each project. This method is used as management considers expended cost to be the best available measure
of progress on these contracts, the majority of which are completed within one year, but may occasionally extend beyond one year.
Inherent uncertainties in estimating costs make it at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the
near term and over the life of the contracts.  

Contract
costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance and completion. Provisions
for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. General and administrative
costs are charged to expense as incurred.  

Changes
in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final
contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income. Such revisions are recognized in the period in which they are
determined.  

Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings are comprised principally of revenue recognized on contracts (on the percentage-of-completion
method) for which billings had not been presented to customers because the amounts were not billable under the contract terms
at the balance sheet date. In accordance with the contract terms, any unbilled receivables at period end will be billed subsequently.
Amounts are billed based on contractual terms. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent billings in excess
of revenues recognized.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s significant
estimates and assumptions include the accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts, percentage of completion revenue recognition
method, the useful life of fixed assets and assumptions used in the fair value of stock-based compensation.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is
generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value
amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually
the vesting period. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Accounting
Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) requires disclosure of the fair value
of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized
or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future
cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

For
information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were adopted and new accounting pronouncements that were issued during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, see the  Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance  and  Recent Accounting
Guidance Not Yet Adopted  sections of Note 2,  Significant Accounting Policies  to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We
do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a- 15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ) and Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ),
of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s PEO and PFO concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s PEO and PFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.   

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

Except
as set forth below we are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any
court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers
of our Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our Company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries
or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision
could have a material adverse effect.  

The Company is engaged in an administrative
proceeding against a former employee who was terminated from his positions with the Company for cause on May 12, 2014. The former
employee has claimed he is due between $24,000 and $48,000 in unpaid wages. The Company is in the process of settling the matter
while continuing to vigorously defend itself. 

The Company has been put on notice by Brock USA, LLC d/b/a Brock International LLC ( Brock ) of
patent infringement relating to certain products acquired by the Company from NexxField, Inc. ( NexxField ), namely,
NexxField s NexxPad turf underlayment panels. In July 2016, Brock commenced a patent infringement lawsuit against NexxField
alleging that NexxField s NexxPad panels infringe certain patents owned by Brock. The Company has not been named as a defendant
in Brock s patent infringement action. The Company believes it will be able to resolve this matter without being named as
a defendant in the lawsuit and will be able to find alternative products if necessary. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

We believe there are no changes that constitute
material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Amended Registration Statement on Form S-1/A, filed with the
SEC on November 4, 2016. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

required to be reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K.   

Item
3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   

There
has been no default in the payment of principal, interest, sinking or purchase fund installment, or any other material default,
with respect to any indebtedness of the Company.  

Item
4. Mine Safety Disclosures.   

Not
applicable.  

Item
