CALERES, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 
    Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and reflect all adjustments and accruals of a normal recurring nature, which management believes are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of Caleres, Inc. (the "Company").  These statements, however, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.  
    
  The Company s business is seasonal in nature due to consumer spending patterns, with higher back-to-school and Christmas  holiday season sales. Traditionally, the third fiscal quarter accounts for a substantial portion of the Company s earnings for the year. Interim results may not necessarily be indicative of results which may be expected for any other interim period or for the year as a whole.  
    
  Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not affect net earnings attributable to Caleres, Inc.  
    
  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016  . 

Note 2 
    Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   and subsequently issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date and ASUs 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12 to clarify the implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09  .    Topic 606 provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized, based upon the core principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.   The ASUs are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company has completed an initial assessment of the ASUs.  Although the ASUs will impact revenue recognition for both of the Company's reportable segments, the Company anticipates a more significant impact on its Famous Footwear segment, primarily due to the ASUs' required treatment for loyalty programs (such as Rewards, the Company's loyalty program).  While the Company is currently developing its implementation plan, including the determination of its adoption method, it expects to adopt the ASUs in the first quarter of 2018.  The Company anticipates that the adoption may have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330),   which requires entities to measure inventory at "the lower of cost and net realizable value", simplifying the current guidance under which entities must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  The ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Because approximately   95%   of the Company's inventories are valued using the LIFO method, the Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which requires entities to measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method, those that result in consolidation of the investee and certain other investments) at fair value and recognize any fair value changes in net income.  The ASU permits entities to elect a measurement alternative for equity investments that don t have readily determinable fair values.  If elected, those investments would be valued at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price  
  
   6 

changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The Company has an investment in a nonconsolidated affiliate that is currently accounted for using the cost method.  The investment, with a carrying value of   $7.0 million   as of October 29, 2016, October 31, 2015 and January 30, 2016, is subject to this ASU. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  Due to the large number of retail operating leases to which the Company is a party, the Company anticipates that the impact to its condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption in the first quarter of 2019 will be significant. However, the adoption of the ASU is not expected to trigger non-compliance with any covenant or other restrictions under the provisions of any of the Company s debt obligations.   
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)  , which simplifies accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, including income taxes, forfeitures and statutory income tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The ASU requires certain income tax impacts related to share-based plans to be recorded within the income tax provision, rather than as a component of additional paid-in capital, as presented today.  Upon adoption of the standard in the first quarter of 2017, the Company anticipates a greater degree of volatility in its income tax provision and effective income tax rate.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which     significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted beginning after December 15, 2018.  The ASU's provisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which it is adopted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3 
    Earnings Per Share 

The Company uses the two-class method to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Caleres, Inc. shareholders. In periods of net loss, no effect is given to the Company s participating securities since they do not contractually participate in the losses of the Company. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Caleres, Inc. shareholders for the periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

7 

Options to purchase   63,915   shares of common stock for the thirteen and   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   56,997   shares of common stock for the thirteen and   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 31, 2015   were not included in the denominator for diluted earnings per common share attributable to Caleres, Inc. shareholders because the effect would be anti-dilutive. 
    
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Company repurchased   900,000   shares and   151,500   shares, respectively, under the publicly announced share repurchase program, which permits repurchases of up to   2.5 million   shares.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company has repurchased a total of   1.1 million   shares at a cost of   $28.1 million  . 

Note 4 
    Long-term and Short-term Financing Arrangements 

Credit Agreement  
  The Company maintains a revolving credit facility for working capital needs in an aggregate amount of up to   $600.0 million  , with the option to increase by up to   $150.0 million  .  On December 18, 2014, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the  Loan Parties ) entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which was further amended on July 20, 2015 to release all of the Company s subsidiaries that were borrowers under or that guaranteed the Credit Agreement other than Sidney Rich Associates, Inc. and BG Retail, LLC (as so amended, the  Credit Agreement ).  After giving effect to the amendment, the Company is the lead borrower, and Sidney Rich Associates, Inc. and BG Retail, LLC are each co-borrowers and guarantors under the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement matures on   December 18, 2019  . 
    
  Borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement is limited to the lesser of the total commitments and the borrowing base ("Loan Cap"), which is based on stated percentages of the sum of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and eligible credit card receivables, as defined, less applicable reserves.  Under the Credit Agreement, the Loan Parties  obligations are secured by a first-priority security interest in all accounts receivable, inventory and certain other collateral.  
    
  Interest on borrowings is at variable rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or the prime rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a spread.  The interest rate and fees for letters of credit vary based upon the level of excess availability under the Credit Agreement.  There is an unused line fee payable on the unused portion under the facility and a letter of credit fee payable on the outstanding face amount under letters of credit. 
    
  The Credit Agreement limits the Company s ability to create, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and liens, make investments or specified payments, give guarantees, pay dividends, make capital expenditures and merge or acquire or sell assets.  In addition, certain additional covenants would be triggered if excess availability were to fall below specified levels,  
  
   8 

including fixed charge coverage ratio requirements.  Furthermore, if excess availability falls below   12.5%   of the Loan Cap for three consecutive business days or an event of default occurs, the lenders may assume dominion and control over the Company s cash (a  cash dominion event ) until such event of default is cured or waived or the excess availability exceeds such amount for   30   consecutive days, provided that a cash dominion event shall be deemed continuing (even if an event of default is no longer continuing and/or excess availability exceeds the required amount for   30   consecutive business days) after a cash dominion event has occurred and been discontinued on two occasions in any twelve-month period. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, judgment defaults in excess of a certain threshold, the failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the agreement to be in full force and effect, and a change of control event.  In addition, if the excess availability falls below the greater of (i)   10.0%   of the lesser of the Loan Cap and (ii)   $50.0 million  , and the fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0, the Company would be in default under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains certain other covenants and restrictions.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under the Credit Agreement as of   October 29, 2016  .  
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , the Company had   no   borrowings outstanding and   $6.5 million   in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  Total borrowing availability was   $531.3 million   at   October 29, 2016  .    
    
  $200 Million Senior Notes Due 2019  
  During 2011, the Company issued   $200.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   7.125%   Senior Notes due 2019 (the  2019 Senior Notes ).  The 2019 Senior Notes were guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of its subsidiaries that was an obligor under the Credit Agreement.  Interest on the 2019 Senior Notes was payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year.  The 2019 Senior Notes were scheduled to mature on May 15, 2019 but were callable at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  On July 20, 2015, the Company commenced a cash tender offer (the "Tender Offer") to purchase any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 2019 Senior Notes.  Upon expiration of the Tender Offer on July 24, 2015,   $160.7 million   aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes were validly tendered at the redemption price of   103.950%  , representing the specified redemption price and a tender premium.  On August 26, 2015, the remaining outstanding   $39.3 million   aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2019 Senior Notes were redeemed at the redemption price of   103.563%  .  During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , the Company recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of the 2019 Senior Notes of   $2.0 million   and   $10.7 million  , respectively, representing the tender offer and call premiums, the unamortized debt issuance costs and the original issue discount.  
    
  $200 Million Senior Notes Due 2023 
  On July 27, 2015, the Company issued   $200.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Notes") in a private placement.  On October 22, 2015, the Company commenced an offer to exchange its 2023 Senior Notes outstanding for substantially identical debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  The exchange offer was completed on November 23, 2015 and did not affect the amount of the Company's indebtedness outstanding.  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes were approximately   $196.3   million after deducting fees and expenses associated with the offering. The Company used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to redeem the outstanding 2019 Senior Notes.  
    
  The 2023 Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company's subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement. Interest on the 2023 Senior Notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2023 Senior Notes will mature on   August 15, 2023  .  Prior to August 15, 2018, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2023 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes plus a "make-whole" premium (as defined in the 2023 Senior Notes indenture) and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  After August 15, 2018, the Company may redeem all or a part of the 2023 Senior Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Interest (as defined in the 2023 Senior Notes indenture), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 15 of the years indicated below: 

9 

If the Company experiences specific kinds of changes of control, it would be required to offer to purchase the 2023 Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase. 
    
  The 2023 Senior Notes also contain other covenants and restrictions that limit certain activities including, among other things, levels of indebtedness, payments of dividends, the guarantee or pledge of assets, certain investments, common stock repurchases, mergers and acquisitions and sales of assets.  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions relating to the 2023 Senior Notes.

Of the   6,500   and   8,000   restricted shares granted during the   thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, all of the shares have a vesting term of   four years  . Of the   357,100   restricted shares granted during the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016  , all of the shares have a vesting term of   four years  .  Of the   301,421   restricted shares granted during the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015  ,   288,921   have a vesting term of   four years   and   12,500   of the shares have a vesting term of   five years  . Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting periods. 
    
  Performance Share Awards 
  During the   thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Company granted   no   performance share awards. During the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the Company granted performance share awards for a targeted   159,000   and   177,921   shares, respectively, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $26.64   and   $30.12  , respectively.  Vesting of performance-based awards is dependent upon the financial performance of the Company and the attainment of certain financial goals during the   three  -year period following the grant. At the end of the vesting period, the employee will have earned an amount of shares or units between   0%   and   200%   of the targeted award, depending on the achievement of the specified financial goals for the service period.  Compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the award and the anticipated number of shares or units to be awarded in accordance with the vesting schedule of the units over the   three  -year service period.

The performance share units are settled in cash and their fair value is based on the unadjusted quoted market price for the Company s common stock on each measurement date. 
    
  Stock Options 
  The following table summarizes stock option activity for the periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  : 

Of the   16,667   stock options granted during the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015  ,   8,333   have a vesting period of   four years   and   8,334   have a vesting period of   five years  .  
    
  Restricted Stock Units for Non-Employee Directors 
  Equity-based grants may be made to non-employee directors in the form of cash-equivalent restricted stock units ("RSUs").  The RSUs earn dividend equivalents at the same rate as dividends on the Company's common stock and are automatically re-invested in additional RSUs.  The Company granted   1,086   and   784   RSUs for dividend equivalents to non-employee directors during the   thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, with weighted-average grant date fair values of   $24.98   and   $30.40  , respectively.  The Company granted   55,250   and   38,228   RSUs, including   3,050   and   2,229   RSUs for dividend equivalents, to non-employee directors during the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, with weighted-average grant date fair values of   $21.78   and   $31.66  , respectively.  All RSUs for dividend equivalents vested immediately and compensation expense was fully recognized during the thirteen and   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .

Note 10 
    Risk Management and Derivatives 

In the normal course of business, the Company s financial results are impacted by currency rate movements in foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows as it makes a portion of its purchases and sales in local currencies. The Company has established policies and business practices that are intended to mitigate a portion of the effect of these exposures. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to manage its currency exposures. These derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives entered into by the Company are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions.  
    
  Derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit and market risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions being hedged. The Company does not believe there is a significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with major international financial institutions and have varying maturities through   October 2017  . Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.  
    
  The Company s hedging strategy uses foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedging instruments, which are recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  The effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedge instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and reclassified to earnings in the period that the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. 
    
  Hedge ineffectiveness is evaluated using the hypothetical derivative method. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness for the thirteen and   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was not material.  

16 

As of   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , the Company had forward contracts maturing at various dates through   October 2017  ,   October 2016   and   January 2017  , respectively. The contract notional amount represents the net amount of all purchase and sale contracts of a foreign currency.  

The classification and fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments included within the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016   are as follows: 

For the thirteen and   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , the effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings was as follows: 

17 

All gains and losses currently included within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income associated with the Company s foreign exchange forward contracts are expected to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months. Additional information related to the Company s derivative financial instruments are disclosed within Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Note 11 
    Fair Value Measurements 

Fair Value Hierarchy    
  Fair value measurement disclosure requirements specify a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources ( observable inputs ) or reflect the Company s own assumptions of market participant valuation ( unobservable inputs ). In accordance with the fair value guidance, the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value are categorized into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:  

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
       
  In determining fair value, the Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Classification of the financial or non-financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
    
  Measurement of Fair Value    
  The Company measures fair value as an exit price, the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, using the procedures described below for all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  
    
  Money Market Funds    
  The Company has cash equivalents consisting of short-term money market funds backed by U.S. Treasury securities. The primary objective of these investing activities is to preserve the Company s capital for the purpose of funding operations and it does not enter into money market funds for trading or speculative purposes. The fair value is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for the funds in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency (Level 1).  

18 

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities  
  The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the  Deferred Compensation Plan ) for the benefit of certain management employees. The investment funds offered to the participants generally correspond to the funds offered in the Company s 401(k) plan, and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. The Deferred Compensation Plan permits the deferral of up to   50%   of base salary and   100%   of compensation received under the Company s annual incentive plan. The deferrals are held in a separate trust, which has been established by the Company to administer the Deferred Compensation Plan. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of the Company s creditors in the event that the Company becomes insolvent. Consequently, the trust qualifies as a grantor trust for income tax purposes (i.e., a  Rabbi Trust ). The liabilities of the Deferred Compensation Plan are presented in other accrued expenses and the assets held by the trust are classified as trading securities within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities are charged to selling and administrative expenses. The fair value is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for the funds in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency (Level 1).  
    
  Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors       
  Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan with deferred amounts valued as if invested in the Company s common stock through the use of phantom stock units ( PSUs ). Under the plan, each participating director s account is credited with the number of PSUs that is equal to the number of shares of the Company s common stock that the participant could purchase or receive with the amount of the deferred compensation, based upon the average of the high and low prices of the Company s common stock on the last trading day of the fiscal quarter when the cash compensation was earned. Dividend equivalents are paid on PSUs at the same rate as dividends on the Company s common stock and are re-invested in additional PSUs at the next fiscal quarter-end. The liabilities of the plan are based on the fair value of the outstanding PSUs and are presented in other accrued expenses (current portion) or other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the PSUs are presented in selling and administrative expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of earnings. The fair value of each PSU is based on an unadjusted quoted market price for the Company s common stock in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency on each measurement date (Level 1).  
    
  Restricted Stock Units for Non-Employee Directors 
  Under the Company s incentive compensation plans, cash-equivalent restricted stock units ( RSUs ) of the Company may be granted at no cost to non-employee directors. The RSUs are subject to a vesting requirement (usually one year), earn dividend-equivalent units, and are settled in cash on the date the director terminates service or such earlier date as a director may elect, subject to restrictions, based on the then current fair value of the Company s common stock. The fair value of each RSU is based on an unadjusted quoted market price for the Company s common stock in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency on each measurement date (Level 1).  Additional information related to restricted stock units for non-employee directors is disclosed in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Performance Share Units 
  Under the Company s incentive compensation plans, common stock or cash may be awarded at the end of the performance period at no cost to certain officers and key employees if certain financial goals are met. Under the plan, employees are granted performance share awards at a target number of shares or units, which generally vest over a   three  -year service period. At the end of the vesting period, the employee will have earned an amount of shares or units between   0%   and   200%   of the targeted award, depending on the achievement of specified financial goals for the service period. The fair value of each performance share unit is based on an unadjusted quoted market price of the Company s common stock in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency on each measurement date (Level 1).  Additional information related to performance share units is disclosed in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments    
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange contracts, to reduce its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are measured at fair value using quoted forward foreign exchange prices from counterparties corroborated by market-based pricing (Level 2). Additional information related to the Company s derivative financial instruments is disclosed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Secured Convertible Note 
  The Company received a   $7.5 million   face value secured convertible note as partial consideration for the December 2014 disposition of Shoes.com.  The convertible note requires installments over   four years   with the first payment of   $1.25 million   due on July 1, 2017 and quarterly installments of   $0.6 million   thereafter, plus accrued interest, until it matures on   December 12, 2019  .  Interest accrues at an annual rate of   6%   until December 11, 2016,   7%   until December 11, 2017,   8%   until December 11, 2018, and   9%   until the maturity date.  The principal and outstanding accrued interest is convertible into common stock of an affiliate of ShoeMe Technologies Limited ("the Purchaser") at a specified conversion price per share, at the Company's option, or automatically upon  
  
   19 

a qualified initial public offering ("IPO") by the Purchaser at the IPO price. The convertible note is measured at fair value using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The fair value of the convertible note is   $7.2 million   at   October 29, 2016  , of which   $1.9 million   is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and   $5.3 million   is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The fair value of the convertible note is   $7.2 million   and   $7.1 million   at   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively, and is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The change in fair value reflects an immaterial amount of interest income for the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  
    
  The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  . The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   or   October 31, 2015  .    

Impairment Charges    
  The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors the Company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset, or a negative industry or economic trend.  When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors, impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method.  Certain factors, such as estimated store sales and expenses, used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement are considered Level 3 inputs as defined by FASB ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement  .  Long-lived assets held and used with a carrying amount of   $100.4 million   and   $89.4 million   at   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  ,  
  
   20 

respectively, were assessed for indicators of impairment and written down to their fair value.  This assessment resulted in the following impairment charges, by segment, which were included in selling and administrative expenses for the respective periods.  

Fair Value of the Company s Other Financial Instruments    
  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents (excluding money market funds discussed above), restricted cash, receivables and trade accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
    
  The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's other financial instruments subject to fair value disclosures are as follows: 

The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was based upon quoted prices in an inactive market as of the end of the respective periods (Level 2). 

The Company s effective tax rate can vary considerably from period to period, depending on a number of factors.  The Company s consolidated effective tax rates were   33.6%   and   26.7%   for the thirteen weeks and   32.3%   and   26.4%   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  During the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016  , the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, related to the settlement of certain federal tax matters.  If these discrete tax benefits had not been recognized, the Company's effective tax rates would have been   34.1%   and   33.4%  , respectively.  During the   thirteen   and   thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015  , the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of   $1.3 million   and   $4.2 million  , respectively.  If these discrete tax benefits had not been recognized, the Company's effective tax rates would have been   29.5%   and   30.8%  , respectively.  On a year-to-date basis, excluding the discrete tax items described above, our higher effective tax rate reflects a greater anticipated mix of domestic earnings, which carry a higher effective tax rate than earnings in our international subsidiaries. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740)  , which requires entities to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 on a retrospective basis during the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in a reclassification of   $0.8 million   from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets as of   January 30, 2016   and a reclassification of   $21.3 million   and   $32.5 million   from current deferred tax liabilities to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities as of   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

    Related Party Transactions 

C. banner International Holdings Limited 
  The Company has a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of C. banner International Holdings Limited ( CBI ) to market Naturalizer footwear in China, effective through August 2017.  The Company is a   51%   owner of the joint venture ( B H Footwear ), with CBI owning the other   49%  .  B H Footwear sells Naturalizer footwear to a retail affiliate of CBI on a wholesale basis, which in turn sells the Naturalizer products through department store shops and free-standing stores in China.  The Company, through its consolidated subsidiary, B H Footwear, sold   $1.3 million   and   $2.8 million   during the   thirteen weeks   and   $5.1 million   and   $7.5 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, of Naturalizer footwear on a wholesale basis to CBI.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company communicated its intention to dissolve the joint venture with CBI upon the expiration of the license to sell Naturalizer footwear. 

Note 14 
    Commitments and Contingencies 

Environmental Remediation    
  Prior operations included numerous manufacturing and other facilities for which the Company may have responsibility under various environmental laws for the remediation of conditions that may be identified in the future. The Company is involved in environmental remediation and ongoing compliance activities at several sites and has been notified that it is or may be a potentially responsible party at several other sites. 
    
  Redfield 
  The Company is remediating, under the oversight of Colorado authorities, the groundwater and indoor air at its owned facility in Colorado (the  Redfield site  or, when referring to remediation activities at or under the facility, the  on-site remediation ) and residential neighborhoods adjacent to and near the property (the  off-site remediation ) that have been affected by solvents previously used at the facility. The current on-site remediation calls for the operation of a pump and treat system (which prevents migration of contaminated groundwater off the property) as the final remedy for the site, subject to monitoring and periodic review of the on-site conditions and other remedial technologies that may be developed in the future. In May 2016, the Company submitted a revised plan to address on-site conditions, including direct treatment of source areas, and received approval from the oversight authorities to begin implementing the revised plan later in 2016. As the treatment of the on-site source areas progresses, the Company expects to convert the pump and treat system to a passive treatment barrier system. Off-site groundwater concentrations have been reducing over time since installation of the pump and treat system in 2000 and injection of clean water beginning in 2003. However, localized areas of contaminated bedrock just beyond the property line continue to impact off-site groundwater. The modified workplan for addressing this condition includes converting the off-site bioremediation system into a monitoring well network and employing different remediation methods in these recalcitrant areas. In accordance with the workplan, a pilot test was conducted of certain groundwater remediation methods and the results of that test were used to develop more detailed plans for remedial activities in the off-site areas, which were approved by the authorities and are being implemented in a phased manner. The results of groundwater monitoring are being used to evaluate the effectiveness of these activities.  In 2014, the Company submitted a proposed expanded remedy workplan that was accepted by the oversight authorities during 2015. The Company continues to implement the expanded remedy workplan.  
    
  The cumulative expenditures for both on-site and off-site remediation through   October 29, 2016   were   $28.6 million  . The Company has recovered a portion of these expenditures from insurers and other third parties.  The reserve for the anticipated future remediation activities at   October 29, 2016   is   $9.7 million  , of which   $8.9 million   is recorded within other liabilities and   $0.8 million   is recorded within other accrued expenses.  Of the total $  9.7 million   reserve,   $4.8 million   is for on-site remediation and   $4.9 million   is for off-site remediation.  The liability for the on-site remediation was discounted at   4.8%  . On an undiscounted basis, the on-site remediation liability would be   $14.3 million   as of   October 29, 2016  . The Company expects to spend approximately $  0.2 million   in the next fiscal year,   $0.1 million   in each of the following four years and   $13.7 million   in the aggregate thereafter related to the on-site remediation. 
    
  Other 
  The Company has completed its remediation efforts at its closed New York tannery and   two   associated landfills. In 1995, state environmental authorities reclassified the status of these sites as being properly closed and requiring only continued maintenance and monitoring through 2024. The Company has an accrued liability of   $1.2 million   at   October 29, 2016   to complete the cleanup, maintenance and monitoring at these sites, which has been discounted at   6.4%  . Of the   $1.2 million   reserve,   $1.0 million   is recorded in other liabilities and   $0.2 million   is recorded in other accrued expenses. On an undiscounted basis, this liability would be   $1.4 million  . The Company expects to spend approximately   $0.2 million   in each of the next five years and   $0.4 million   in the aggregate thereafter related to these sites. In addition, various federal and state authorities have identified the Company as a potentially  
  
   22 

responsible party for remediation at certain other sites. However, the Company does not currently believe that its liability for such sites, if any, would be material. 
    
  The Company continues to evaluate its estimated costs in conjunction with its environmental consultants and records its best estimate of such liabilities. However, future actions and the associated costs are subject to oversight and approval of various governmental authorities. Accordingly, the ultimate costs may vary, and it is possible costs may exceed the recorded amounts. 
    
  Litigation 
  The Company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including various employee-related claims under state and federal law, such as claims for discrimination, wrongful discharge or retaliation and for wage and hour violations. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such ordinary course of business proceedings and litigation currently pending is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial position. Legal costs associated with litigation are generally expensed as incurred.

ITEM 2 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OVERVIEW 

Financial Highlights 
  Our financial performance during the third quarter of 2016 reflects a solid back-to-school season.  Despite a mixed consumer environment, our Famous Footwear segment reported a   2.1%   increase in same-store sales for the quarter, and our Brand Portfolio segment reported a gross margin improvement of more than 300 basis points to   37.5%  .  
     
  The following is a summary of the financial highlights for the   third quarter of 2016  :    

Consolidated net sales increased   $3.6 million  , or   0.5%  , to   $732.2 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  .  We are pleased with the solid back-to-school season at Famous Footwear, where sales for the quarter increased   $11.6 million  , or   2.6%  .  Our Brand Portfolio segment reported an   $8.1 million   decrease in net sales, driven by lower net sales of our Naturalizer and Dr. Scholl's brands, partially offset by higher sales from our Sam Edelman, Vince and Ryka brands.  

Gross profit increased   $5.4 million  , or   1.9%  , to   $293.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , reflecting an improved mix of higher margin brands and lower wholesale sales allowances in our Brand Portfolio segment, partially offset by a lower gross profit rate in our Famous Footwear segment.  As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to   40.1%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   39.6%   for the   third quarter of 2015  , reflecting an improved mix of higher margin brands and a higher consolidated mix of retail versus wholesale sales in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in freight expense attributable to higher e-commerce sales.   

Consolidated operating earnings increased   $3.3 million  , or   6.2%  , to   $55.5 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , reflecting a higher gross profit rate and sales volume, partially offset by additional costs associated with the modernization and expansion of our Lebanon, Tennessee distribution center, higher expenses related to rent for our growing retail store base and our ongoing investment in new brands.  

Consolidated net earnings attributable to Caleres, Inc. were   $34.7 million  , or   $0.81   per diluted share, in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to net earnings of   $34.0 million  , or   $0.78   per diluted share, in the   third quarter of 2015  .  The   third quarter of 2015   included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $2.0 million   ($1.2 million on an after-tax basis, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to the refinancing of our senior notes.  We incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $10.7 million   ($6.5 million on an after-tax basis, or $0.15 per diluted share) for the nine months ended October 31, 2015.  
       
  Our debt-to-capital ratio improved to   23.3%   as of   October 29, 2016  , compared to   24.6%   as of   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , primarily reflecting higher shareholders' equity due to the benefit of our net earnings.  Our current ratio increased to 2.46 to 1 as of   October 29, 2016  , compared to 2.31 to 1 at   October 31, 2015   and 2.24 to 1 at   January 30, 2016  .  
    
  Outlook for the Remainder of   2016    
  During the third quarter, we continued to adapt to changing consumer shopping trends, delivering growth in net sales, margins, operating earnings, and net cash provided by operating activities.  Throughout the remainder of 2016, we plan to continue executing against our strategy to deliver consistent, profitable and sustainable growth to our shareholders.

Following are the consolidated results and the results by segment:  

Net Sales  
  Net sales increased   $3.6 million  , or   0.5%  , to   $732.2 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $728.6 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  Our Famous Footwear segment reported an   $11.6 million  , or   2.6%  , increase in net sales, reflecting a solid back-to-school season and growth in e-commerce sales.  Net sales of our Brand Portfolio segment declined   $8.1 million  , driven by lower net sales of our Naturalizer and Dr. Scholl's brands, a portion of which were planned declines, partially offset by higher sales from our Sam Edelman, Vince and Ryka brands.  
    
  Net sales decreased   $28.9 million  , or   1.5%  , to   $1,939.9 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $1,968.8 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  Our Brand Portfolio segment reported a   $39.3 million   decrease in net sales, driven by lower net sales of our Naturalizer, Dr. Scholl's and LifeStride brands, a portion of which were planned declines, partially offset by growth in our Sam Edelman retail operations and higher sales from our Diane Von Furstenberg (launched in 2016), Carlos and Vince brands.  Net sales at our Famous Footwear segment increased   $10.4 million  , primarily reflecting a   0.7%   increase in same-store sales and a higher store count. 
    
  Same-store sales changes are calculated by comparing the sales in stores that have been open at least 13 months.  Relocated stores are treated as new stores, and closed stores are excluded from the calculation.  Sales change from new and closed stores, net reflects the change in net sales due to stores that have been opened or closed during the period and are therefore excluded from the same-store sales calculation. E-commerce sales for those e-commerce websites that function as an extension of a retail chain are included in the same-store sales calculation. 
    
  Gross Profit  
  Gross profit increased   $5.4 million  , or   1.9%  , to   $293.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $288.4 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  , reflecting an improved gross profit rate and higher sales volume.  As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to   40.1%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   39.6%   for the   third quarter of 2015  , reflecting an improved mix of our higher margin brands and lower wholesale sales allowances within our Brand Portfolio segment. In addition, we experienced a higher consolidated mix of retail versus wholesale sales in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in freight expense driven by higher e-commerce sales.  Retail and wholesale net sales were 69% and 31%, respectively, in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to 67% and 33% in the   third quarter of 2015  .

Gross profit increased   $1.3 million  , or   0.2%  , to   $801.1 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $799.8 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , reflecting higher gross profit in our Brand Portfolio segment and lower gross profit in our Famous Footwear segment.  As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to   41.3%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   40.6%   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  This increase reflects higher rates in our Brand Portfolio segment, driven by an improved mix of our higher margin brands, and a higher consolidated mix of retail versus wholesale net sales.  Retail and wholesale net sales were 68% and 32%, respectively, in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to 67% and 33% in the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  
    
  We classify certain warehousing, distribution, sourcing and other inventory procurement costs in selling and administrative expenses.  Accordingly, our gross profit and selling and administrative expense rates, as a percentage of net sales, may not be comparable to other companies.  
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses  
  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $2.1 million  , or   0.9%  , to   $238.3 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $236.2 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase was primarily driven by higher costs associated with our expanded distribution center in Lebanon, Tennessee, higher store rent in our retail divisions and our ongoing investment in our new brands.  This increase was partially offset by lower cash-based incentive compensation expense.  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to   32.5%   for the   third quarter of 2016   from   32.4%   for the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $3.1 million  , or   0.5%  , to   $684.6 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $681.5 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  Expenses related to store openings and the development of our new brands were partially offset by lower cash-based incentive compensation expense.  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to   35.3%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   from   34.6%   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  . 
    
  Operating Earnings  
  Operating earnings increased   $3.3 million  , or     6.2%  , to   $55.5 million   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $52.2 million   for the     third quarter of 2015  , primarily reflecting a higher gross profit rate and higher net sales, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses.  As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings increased to     7.6%   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared to     7.2%   for the   third quarter of 2015  . 
    
  Operating earnings decreased   $1.8 million  , or   1.6%   to   $116.5 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $118.3 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , reflecting lower net sales and higher selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by a higher gross profit rate.  As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings remained consistent at   6.0%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   and October 31, 2015. 
    
  Interest Expense  
  Interest expense decreased   $0.6 million  , or   16.0%  , to   $3.5 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $4.1 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily reflecting higher capitalized interest of $0.4 million associated with the expansion and modernization of our Lebanon, Tennessee distribution center, with no corresponding amount capitalized in the   third quarter of 2015  .  In addition, in 2015 we refinanced $200.0 million of senior notes, which reduced our interest rate from 7.125% to 6.25%, as further discussed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.   
    
  Interest expense decreased   $2.3 million  , or   18.4%  , to   $10.6 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $12.9 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , primarily reflecting higher capitalized interest of $1.3 million associated with the expansion and modernization of our Lebanon, Tennessee distribution center, with no corresponding amount capitalized in the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  In addition, we have benefited from a lower interest rate on our senior notes, as described above.  
    
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt was   $2.0 million   for the third quarter and   $10.7 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , reflecting the redemption of our senior notes prior to maturity, as further discussed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  We incurred no corresponding charges during the third quarter or   nine months ended October 29, 2016  .

Income Tax Provision  
  Our effective tax rate can vary considerably from period to period, depending on a number of factors.  Our consolidated effective tax rate was   33.6%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   26.7%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  In the   third quarter of 2016  , we recognized a discrete tax benefit of   $0.3 million   related to federal tax matters.  During the   third quarter of 2015  , we recognized discrete tax benefits of   $1.3 million  , primarily related to the utilization of certain tax asset carryforwards that were previously fully reserved.  If these discrete tax benefits had not been recognized during the   third quarter of 2016   or   2015  , our effective tax rates would have been   34.1%   and   29.5%  , respectively.  
    
  Our consolidated effective tax rate was   32.3%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   26.4%   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  We recognized discrete tax benefits of $1.1 million during the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , related to the settlement of certain federal tax matters.  For the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , we recognized discrete tax benefits of $4.2 million.  The discrete tax benefits in 2015 were attributable to a number of factors, including the conversion of one of our primary operating subsidiaries to a limited liability company and the utilization of certain tax asset carryforwards primarily related to the disposition of Shoes.com that were previously fully reserved.  If these discrete tax benefits had not been recognized during the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   and 2015, our effective tax rates would have been   33.4%   and   30.8%  , respectively.  On a year-to-date basis, excluding the discrete tax items described above, our higher effective tax rate reflects a greater anticipated mix of domestic earnings, which carry a higher effective tax rate than earnings in our international subsidiaries.  
    
  Net Earnings  
  Net earnings increased   $0.7 million  , or   2.2%  , to   $34.7 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $34.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  , reflecting the factors described above.  
    
  Net earnings increased   $2.0 million  , or   2.9%  , to   $72.3 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $70.3 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , reflecting the factors described above.  
    
  Net Earnings Attributable to Caleres, Inc.  
  Net earnings attributable to Caleres, Inc. were   $34.7 million   and   $72.3 million   for the   third quarter   and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to net earnings of   $34.0 million   and   $70.1 million   for the   third quarter of 2015   and   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , as a result of the factors described above.

Net Sales  
  Net sales increased   $11.6 million  , or   2.6%  , to   $467.8 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $456.2 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase was primarily driven by a   2.1%   increase in same-store sales and a net increase in sales from new and closed stores.  Famous Footwear experienced growth in e-commerce sales, and reported improvement in both online conversion rate and customer traffic, due in part to the expansion of our in-store fulfillment program.  Strong e-commerce sales were partially offset by a decline in customer traffic at our retail store locations.  The segment experienced sales growth in the lifestyle athletic and sport-influenced product, while boot sales were lower during the quarter, due in part to the unseasonably warm fall.  During the   third quarter of 2016  , we opened   16   new stores and closed   nine   stores, resulting in   1,051   stores and total square footage of   7.0 million   at the end of the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   1,044   stores and total square footage of   7.0 million   at the end of the   third quarter of 2015  .  On a trailing twelve month basis, sales per square foot, excluding e-commerce, decreased   0.9%   to   $216   for the twelve months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $218   for the twelve months ended   October 31, 2015  .  Members of Rewards, our customer loyalty program, continue to account for a majority of the segment s sales, with approximately 76% of our net sales made to Rewards program members in the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to 75% in the   third quarter of 2015  .  
    
  Net sales increased   $10.4 million  , or   0.9%  , to   $1,222.5 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $1,212.1 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by a   0.7%   increase in same-store sales and a higher store count.  Famous Footwear experienced growth in e-commerce sales, partially offset by a decline in customer traffic  
  
   35 

at our retail store locations, as described above.  Famous Footwear experienced sales growth in the lifestyle athletic category, while sales of performance athletic footwear declined.  
    
  Gross Profit  
  Gross profit decreased   $0.2 million  , or   0.1%  , to   $194.7 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $194.9 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit was   41.6%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   42.7%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  The decrease in our gross profit rate primarily reflects higher freight expense due to growth in our Famous.com business and the in-store fulfillment program as well as lower product margins in certain categories, including a shift from higher margin boots to booties.  
    
  Gross profit decreased   $1.8 million  , or   0.3%  , to   $540.8 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $542.6 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , primarily driven by a lower gross profit rate, partially offset by higher net sales.  As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit was   44.2%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   44.8%   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  . The decrease in our gross profit rate primarily reflects the factors described above. 
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses  
  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $6.7 million  , or   4.3%  , to   $162.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $155.3 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  The increase was attributable to higher store rent for our expanding store base and warehouse and distribution costs, primarily related to our expanded distribution center in Lebanon, Tennessee, partially offset by lower expenses related to cash-based incentive compensation.  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to   34.6%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   34.0%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  
    
  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $12.4 million  , or   2.8%  , to   $459.7 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $447.3 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by the factors described above.  As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to   37.6%   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   36.9%   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  
    
  Operating Earnings   
  Operating earnings decreased   $6.9 million  , or     17.5%  , to   $32.7 million   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $39.6 million   for the     third quarter of 2015  .  The decrease reflects higher selling and administrative expenses and a lower gross profit rate, partially offset by higher net sales. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings decreased     to     7.0%   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared     to   8.7%   for the     third quarter of 2015  .  
    
  Operating earnings decreased   $14.2 million  , or     14.9%  , to   $81.1 million   for the     nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $95.3 million   for the     nine months ended October 31, 2015  , reflecting the factors described above.  As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings decreased     to     6.6%   for the     nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared     to   7.9%   for the     nine months ended October 31, 2015  .

Net Sales    
  Net sales decreased   $8.1 million  , or     3.0%  , to   $264.4 million   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $272.5 million   for     the   third quarter of 2015  .      The decrease was driven by lower net sales of our Naturalizer and Dr. Scholl's brands, partially offset by higher sales from our Sam Edelman, Vince and Ryka brands. A portion of the sales declines were planned, as we elected to discontinue certain lower margin business.  In general, our strongest category for the quarter was lifestyle athletic, while sales of tall shaft boots were lower during the   third quarter of 2016  .  Our retail sales primarily benefited from a net increase in sales from new and closed stores, partially offset by a decrease in same-store sales of   5.4%  .  During the   third quarter of 2016  , we opened   two   stores and closed   two   stores, resulting in a total of   167   stores and total square footage of   0.3   million at the end of the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   164   stores and total square footage of   0.3   million at the end of the   third quarter of 2015  .  Sales per square foot, excluding e-commerce, decreased   7.5%   to   $84   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $91   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  Our unfilled order position decreased   $3.2 million  , or   1.0%  , to   $315.2 million   as of   October 29, 2016  , from   $318.4 million   as of   October 31, 2015  , primarily due to declines in our Franco Sarto, Ryka and Dr. Scholl's brands, partially offset by increases in our Sam Edelman and Naturalizer brands.

Net sales decreased   $39.3 million  , or   5.2%  , to   $717.4 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $756.7 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  The decrease was driven by lower net sales of our Naturalizer, Dr. Scholl's and LifeStride brands, a portion of which were planned declines, partially offset by growth in our Sam Edelman retail operations and higher sales from our Diane Von Furstenberg (launched in 2016), Carlos and Vince brands.      Our retail sales benefited from a net increase in sales from new and closed stores, partially offset by a decrease in same-store sales of   5.2%   and a lower Canadian dollar exchange rate.  During the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , we opened   seven   stores and closed   five   stores. Sales per square foot, excluding e-commerce, decreased   10.2%   to   $236   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $262   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .

As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to   37.5%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   34.3%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  Our gross profit rate benefited from an improved mix of our higher margin brands and lower wholesale sales allowances. 
    
  Gross profit increased   $3.1 million  , or   1.2%  , to   $260.3 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $257.2 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , driven by the factors described above.

As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased to   26.0%   for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to   26.6%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .

  Operating earnings increased   $9.5 million  ,   or   44.7%  ,   to   $30.5 million   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared to   $21.0 million   for the     third quarter of 2015  .  The increase reflects a higher gross profit rate and lower selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower net sales.  As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings increased to     11.5%   for the     third quarter of 2016  , compared to     7.7%   in the     third quarter of 2015  .

OTHER 

The Other category includes unallocated corporate administrative expenses and other costs and recoveries.  Costs of $7.7 million were incurred for the   third quarter of 2016  , compared to $8.5 million for the third quarter of 2015, reflecting lower consulting and other professional fees and lower cash-based incentive compensation during the   third quarter of 2016  .    
    
  Unallocated corporate administrative expenses and other costs and recoveries were $22.1 million for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to $25.1 million for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  The $3.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to lower cash-based incentive compensation for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  .

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Borrowings  

Total debt obligations of   $196.9 million   at   October 29, 2016   increased   $0.4 million   compared to   $196.5 million   at   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  .  Interest expense for the   third quarter of 2016   decreased   $0.6 million   to   $3.5 million  , compared to   $4.1 million   for the   third quarter of 2015   and decreased   $2.3 million   to   $10.6 million   for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $12.9 million   for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  .  The decreases were primarily a result of capitalized interest of   $0.4 million   and   $1.3 million   during the third quarter and   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , respectively, associated with the expansion and modernization of our Lebanon, Tennessee distribution center.  The expansion and modernization is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, we refinanced our senior notes, which reduced our interest rate from 7.125% to 6.25%, as further described below.  
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , we had no borrowings outstanding and   $6.5 million   in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  Total borrowing availability was   $531.3 million   at   October 29, 2016  .  We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under the Credit Agreement as of   October 29, 2016  .  
    
  $200 Million Senior Notes  
  As further discussed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on July 20, 2015, we commenced a cash tender offer for our 2019 Senior Notes.  The tender offer expired on July 24, 2015 and $160.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes were tendered.  The remaining $39.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Senior Notes was redeemed on August 26, 2015.  During the third quarter and   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $2.0 million   and   $10.7 million  , respectively, representing the tender offer and call premiums, the unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the 2019 Senior Notes.   Of the   $2.0 million   loss on early extinguishment of debt for the   third quarter of 2015  , approximately $0.6 million was non-cash.  Of the   $10.7 million   loss on early extinguishment of debt for the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , approximately $3.0 million was non-cash.  
     On July 27, 2015, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Senior Notes in a private placement.  On October 22, 2015, we commenced an offer to exchange our 2023 Senior Notes outstanding for substantially identical debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The exchange offer was completed on November 23, 2015 and did not affect the amount of our indebtedness outstanding. 
    
  The 2023 Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the subsidiaries of Caleres, Inc. that is an obligor under the Credit Agreement, and bear interest at 6.25%, which is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2016. The 2023 Senior Notes mature on August 15, 2023. Prior to August 15, 2018, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Senior Notes at various redemption prices. 
   The 2023 Senior Notes also contain covenants and restrictions that limit certain activities including, among other things, levels of indebtedness, payments of dividends, the guarantee or pledge of assets, certain investments, common stock repurchases, mergers and acquisitions and sales of assets.  As of   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions relating to the 2023 Senior Notes. 
    
  Working Capital and Cash Flow 

39 

Reasons for the major variances in cash provided (used) in the table above are as follows:  
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $53.0 million   higher in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended October 31, 2015  , reflecting the following factors:   
             
    A decrease in prepaid expenses and other current and noncurrent assets in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to an increase in the comparable period in   2015   due to lower prepaid rent as of   October 29, 2016   compared to   October 31, 2015  , reflecting a shift in the timing of rent payment due dates relative to the end of our fiscal quarter; 
                
    A decrease in receivables in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to an increase in the comparable period in   2015   due primarily to lower wholesale sales volume in the latter portion of the quarter and improved cash collections; and 
                
    A decrease in inventory in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , compared to an increase in the comparable period in   2015  , reflecting our continued focus on inventory management; partially offset by  
                
    A larger decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   compared to the comparable period in   2015  , reflecting lower interest payable on our 2023 Senior Notes due to a lower interest rate and a shift in the timing of payments, as well as lower anticipated payments under our cash-based incentive compensation plans; and 
                
    A larger decrease in accounts payable in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   compared to the comparable period in   2015  , driven by lower purchases of inventory resulting from the softer retail environment. 
       
  Cash used for investing activities was   $3.4 million   higher in the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  , as compared to   2015   primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of $7.1 million of proceeds upon the sale of a vacant building at our corporate headquarters during the   third quarter of 2015  , partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment during the   nine months ended October 29, 2016  .  For fiscal 2016, we expect purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software of approximately $70 million.  
    
  Cash used for financing activities was   $13.9 million   higher for the   nine months ended October 29, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily reflecting higher share repurchases under our stock repurchase program.  We can use the repurchase program, as further discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, to repurchase shares on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending upon market conditions.   
    
  A summary of key financial data and ratios at the dates indicated is as follows:  

(1) 
    Working capital has been computed as total current assets less total current liabilities. 
              (2) 
    The debt-to-capital ratio has been computed by dividing total debt by total capitalization. Total debt is defined as long-term debt and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. Total capitalization is defined as total debt and total shareholders  equity. 
              (3) 
    The current ratio has been computed by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. 
          
  Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, driven by both strong earnings and improvements in our working capital.  Working capital at   October 29, 2016   was   $515.5 million  , which was   $50.4 million   and   $30.7 million   higher than at   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively.  Our current ratio increased to 2.46 to 1 as of   October 29, 2016  , compared to 2.31 to 1 at   October 31, 2015   and 2.24 to 1 at   January 30, 2016  .  The increase in working capital and the current ratio from   October 31, 2015   to   October 29, 2016   reflects an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in other accrued expenses, partially offset by lower inventory levels and higher trade accounts payable.  The increase in working capital and the current ratio from   January 30, 2016   to   October 29, 2016   reflects an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by lower prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventory levels.  The increase in cash and cash equivalents from   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016   to   October 29, 2016   primarily reflects our net earnings and related operating cash flows during the periods.  Our debt-to-capital ratio improved to   23.3%   as of   October 29, 2016  , compared to   24.6%   as of   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , primarily reflecting higher shareholders' equity due to the benefit of our net earnings.  
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , we had   $173.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents.  The majority of this balance represents the accumulated unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries, which are considered indefinitely reinvested.   

40 

We declared and paid dividends of     $0.07     per share in both the   third quarter of 2016   and the   third quarter of 2015  .  The declaration and payment of any future dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.  However, we presently expect that dividends will continue to be paid.  

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

Our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, operating lease commitments, long-term debt, interest on long-term debt, minimum license commitments, derivative obligations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, obligations for our supplemental executive retirement plan and other postretirement benefits and obligations.  
    
  Except for changes within the normal course of business (primarily changes in purchase obligations, which fluctuate throughout the year as a result of the seasonal nature of our operations, borrowings under and repayments of our revolving credit agreement and changes in operating lease commitments as a result of new stores, store closures and lease renewals), there have been no other significant changes to our contractual obligations identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016  . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

No material changes have occurred related to critical accounting policies and estimates since the end of the most recent fiscal year. For further information, see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016  .

41 

ITEM 4 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
  It is the Chief Executive Officer's and Chief Financial Officer's ultimate responsibility to ensure we maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our disclosure controls and procedures include mandatory communication of material events, automated accounting processing and reporting, management review of monthly, quarterly and annual results, an established system of internal controls and internal control reviews by our internal auditors.  
    
  A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.  The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that their objectives are achieved.  As of   October 29, 2016  , management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
    
  There were no significant changes to internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   October 29, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.    

PART II 
    OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the outcome of such ordinary course of business proceedings and litigation currently pending will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.  All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred.  
    
  Information regarding Legal Proceedings is set forth within Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and incorporated by reference herein.  

ITEM 1A 
    RISK FACTORS 

Changes to Federal overtime regulations could increase our payroll costs. 
  In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor ("DOL") released updated overtime and exemption rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act which increase the minimum salary needed to qualify for the standard white collar employee exemption and the threshold to qualify for a highly compensated employee ("HCE").  Additionally, the updated rules establish a mechanism for automatically increasing the minimum salary and compensation levels every three years.  Changes to the overtime and exemption rules may increase the Company's payroll costs and the risk of litigation.  The rules had an effective date of December 1, 2016.  However, on November 22, 2016, a federal district court temporarily enjoined enforcement of the rules.  The final outcome of these proceedings and potential impact to the Company is uncertain.  

42 

Other than the risk factor described above, there have been no material changes that have occurred related to our risk factors since the end of the most recent fiscal year.  For further information, see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016  .   

ITEM 2 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

The following table provides information relating to our repurchases of common stock during the   third quarter   of   2016  : 

(1) 
    On August 25, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 2,500,000 shares of our outstanding common stock.  We can use the repurchase program to repurchase shares on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions.  The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Under this plan, 900,000 shares were repurchased during the nine months ended   October 29, 2016   and 151,500 shares were repurchased during fiscal year 2015.  Therefore, there were 1,448,500 shares authorized to be repurchased under the program as of   October 29, 2016  . Our repurchases of common stock are limited under our debt agreements.  
       
           (2) 
    Includes shares that were tendered by employees related to certain share-based awards and shares purchased as part of our publicly announced program.  The shares related to employee share-based awards were tendered in satisfaction of the exercise price of stock options and/or to satisfy minimum tax withholding amounts for non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and stock performance awards.
