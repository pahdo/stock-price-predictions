NOTE 1  
  Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position as of August 31, 2016, in addition to the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. Due to the seasonal nature of the Corporation s business, interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.  
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting
on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally accompanying the annual consolidated financial statements have been omitted. The audited consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2016 and the unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation s latest annual report on Form 10-K.  

NOTE 2  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements       In November 2015, FASB issued ASU No.
2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. For public entities, this update is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. The Corporation implemented this
pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 without a material effect on financial condition and results of operations.      

NOTE 3  
  Discontinued Operations       During September 2014, the Corporation made a strategic
decision to exit the recreational vehicle industry in order to focus on its core housing business. As a result, on October 7, 2014, the Corporation completed the sale of certain assets associated with its recreational vehicle segment to
Evergreen Recreational Vehicles, LLC.

  Warranty       A reconciliation of accrued warranty is as follows:  
   
   At August 31, 2016, the total current obligation for warranty and related expenses associated with
discontinued operations is estimated to be $126,000 as compared to $150,000 at May 31, 2016.     

NOTE 7  
  Life Insurance Loans       Life insurance loans have no fixed repayment schedule, and have
interest rates ranging from 4.2 percent to 7.4 percent. The weighted average interest rate is 5.2 percent.     

NOTE 8  
  Income Taxes       At August 31, 2016, the Corporation s gross deferred tax assets of
approximately $48.7 million consist of approximately $32.0 million in federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, $7.7 million in state net operating loss carryforwards and $9.0 million resulting from temporary differences between
financial and tax reporting. The federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have a life expectancy of between eleven and twenty years. The state net operating loss carryforwards have a life expectancy, depending on the state
where a loss was incurred, between one and twenty years. The Corporation has recorded a full valuation allowance against this asset. If the Corporation, after considering future negative and positive evidence regarding the realization of
deferred tax assets, determines that a lesser valuation allowance is warranted, it would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of determination. For the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Corporation
utilized previously fully-reserved federal net operating loss carryforwards of $345,000 and state operating loss carryforwards of $63,000 and released corresponding amounts of the valuation allowance to offset federal and state income tax expense.

NOTE 9  
  Commitments and Contingencies       The Corporation was contingently liable at August 31,
2016 and May 31, 2016, under repurchase agreements with certain financial institutions providing inventory financing for dealers of its products. Under these arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing and park model
industries, the Corporation agrees to repurchase units in the event of default by the dealer at declining prices over the term of the agreement. The period to potentially repurchase units is between 12 to 24 months. The maximum repurchase
liability is the total amount that would be paid upon the default of the Corporation s independent dealers.    The maximum potential
repurchase liability, without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased units, was approximately $28 million at August 31, 2016 and approximately $25 million at May 31, 2016. As a result of the Corporation s favorable experience
regarding repurchased units, which is largely due to the strength of dealers selling the Corporation s products, the Corporation maintained at August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, a $100,000 loss reserve that is a component of other accrued
liabilities. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many dealers and financial institutions. The loss, if any, under these agreements is the difference between the repurchase cost and the resale value of the units. The
Corporation estimates the fair value of this commitment considering both the contingent losses and the value of the guarantee. This amount has historically been insignificant. The Corporation believes that any potential loss under the
agreements in effect at August 31, 2016 will not be material to its financial position or results of operations.   The amounts of
obligations from repurchased units and incurred net losses for the periods presented are as follows:

NOTE 9  
  Commitments and Contingencies         (Continued)         
  The Corporation is a party to various pending legal proceedings in the normal course of
business. Management believes that any losses resulting from such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s results of operations or financial position.  
 The Corporation utilizes a combination of insurance coverage and self-insurance for certain items, including workers  compensation and
group health benefits. Liabilities for workers  compensation are recognized for estimated future medical costs and indemnity costs. Liabilities for group health benefits are recognized for claims incurred but not paid. Insurance
reserves are estimated based upon a combination of historical data and actuarial information. Actual results could differ from these estimates.      

NOTE 10  
  Secured Revolving Credit Facility       On March 20, 2015, the Corporation
( Borrower(s) ) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with First Business Capital Corp. ( First Business Capital ). Under the Loan Agreement, First Business Capital will provide a
secured revolving credit facility to the Borrowers for a term of three years, renewable on an annual basis thereafter with each renewal for a successive one-year term. The Corporation may obtain loan advances up to a maximum of $10,000,000
subject to certain collateral-obligation ratios. In addition, loan advances bear interest at 3.75% in excess of  The Wall Street Journal s  published one year LIBOR rate, and are secured by substantially all of the Borrowers 
assets, now owned or hereafter acquired. Interest is payable monthly, in arrears, and all principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due and payable upon termination of the Loan Agreement. First Business Capital also agreed under the
Loan Agreement to issue, or cause to be issued by a bank affiliate or other bank, letters of credit for the account of the Corporation. However, no advances have yet been made in connection with such letters of credit.  
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the following additional amendments were made to the Loan Agreement:  

An increase in the capital expenditure limit for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017 from $800,000 in the aggregate to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. In the absence of any subsequent amendment, the capital
expenditure limit for subsequent fiscal years shall remain at $800,000 in the aggregate per fiscal year; and

NOTE 11  
  Stock-Based Compensation       On June 25, 2015, the Corporation s Board of Directors
approved the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan ( Plan ), which allows the granting of stock options and other equity awards to directors, officers, employees, and eligible independent contractors of the Corporation and is intended to retain and
reward key employees  performance and efforts as they relate to the Corporation s long-term objectives and strategic plan. The Plan was subsequently approved by shareholders at the Corporation s annual shareholder meeting on
September 21, 2015. A total of 700,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under the Plan. Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to, or greater than, the market price of the Corporation s
stock at the date of grant and vest over a period of time as determined by the Corporation at the date of grant up to the contractual ten year life at which time the options expires.  
 The following table summarizes option activity for the three months ended August 31, 2016:  
   
   Stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the stock options vested during the first quarter of
2017 was approximately $31,000. At August 31, 2016, the intrinsic value of all options outstanding approximated $2,029,000 and had a weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately nine years. In addition, the intrinsic value
of all vested and exercisable options outstanding approximated $355,000 and had a remaining contractual life of approximately nine years. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock-based awards outstanding at August 31, 2016 was
$530,000 and is to be recorded over a weighted-average life of approximately four years.

NOTE 11  
  Stock-Based Compensation        (Continued)         
  The Corporation records all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options, in the consolidated
statements of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant. The Corporation currently uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock
options on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by stock price as well as assumptions that include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, expected life of the awards, risk-free interest rate, and expected
dividends.    The fair value of the options granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were estimated at the date of grant using the
following weighted average assumptions:      
   Volatility is estimated based on historical volatility measured monthly for a time period equal to the
expected life of the option ending on the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is determined based on observed U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of the grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the options. The
expected option life (estimated average period of time the options will be outstanding) is estimated based on the expected exercise date of the options. The expected dividend yield of zero is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of
grant as adjusted for any expected changes during the life of the options.      

NOTE 12  
  Earnings Per Share       Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the combination of dilutive common share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the
Corporation s Stock Incentive Plan and the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Dilutive common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options to purchase shares, which is
calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

   There were 13,716 and 129,139 anti-dilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.        
  Overview     The Corporation designs,
produces and markets manufactured housing, modular housing and park models to independent dealers, developers, campgrounds and manufactured housing communities located throughout the United States and Canada. To better serve the needs of its
dealers, developers, campgrounds and communities, the Corporation has ten manufacturing facilities in nine states; including a facility in Elkhart, Indiana that commenced operations in June 2016. Manufactured housing, modular housing and park
models are sold to customers either through floor plan financing with various financial institutions, credit terms, or on a cash basis. While the Corporation maintains production of manufactured housing, modular homes and park models throughout
the year, seasonal fluctuations in sales do occur.    Manufactured Housing, Modular Housing and Park Model Industry Conditions   
 Sales and production of manufactured housing, modular housing and park models are affected by winter weather conditions at the
Corporation s northern plants. Manufactured and modular housing are marketed under a number of trademarks, and are available in a variety of dimensions. Park models are marketed under the  Shore Park  trademark.

  Manufactured Housing, Modular Housing and Park Model Industry Conditions         (Continued)   
   
  Manufactured housing products are built according to standards established by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development. Modular homes are built according to state, provincial or local building codes. Park models are built according to specifications established by the American National Standards Institute, and are intended to provide
temporary living accommodations for individuals seeking leisure travel and outdoor recreation.    Sales of manufactured housing, modular
housing and park models are affected by the strength of the U.S. economy, interest rate and employment levels, consumer confidence and the availability of wholesale and retail financing. Recent trends regarding calendar year unit shipments of
the Corporation s products and their respective industries are as follows:

     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued).        
   
   Results of Operations   Three-Month Period Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three-Month Period Ended
August 31, 2015       Net Sales and Unit Shipments    
   
   Net sales increased approximately 25.5 percent. The increase was comprised of a 24.6 percent increase in
manufactured housing net sales, a 6.9 percent increase in modular housing net sales, and a 100.8 percent increase in park model net sales. Current year net sales includes approximately $2,086,000 attributable to the Elkhart, Indiana facility which
commenced operations in June 2016.    For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the percentage increase or decrease in unit shipments from the
comparable period last year are as follows:      
   Compared to the prior year, the average net sales price for manufactured housing and park models decreased 4.0
and 1.4 percent, respectively, primarily as a result of homes sold with less square footage and fewer amenities and was partially offset by a price increase. The average net sales price for modular housing increased 14.6 percent as a result of
a price increase and product sold with greater square footage and additional amenities.

     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued).        
   
    Cost of Sales    
   
   Cost of sales, in dollars, increased primarily as a result of increased net sales. In addition, current
year cost of sales includes approximately $2,645,000 attributable to the Elkhart, Indiana facility; a portion of which were costs associated with startup inefficiencies. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased due to more effectively
controlling material costs during the procurement and manufacturing process, and certain manufacturing expenses being fixed amid rising sales.  
   Selling and Administrative Expenses        
   Selling and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased sales-based compensation and
performance-based compensation. In addition, current year selling and administrative expenses includes approximately $172,000 attributable to the Elkhart, Indiana facility. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses
declined due to certain costs remaining relatively constant amid rising sales.     Interest Expense    
   
   Interest expense increased as the result of debt financing costs incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016
that are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Credit Facility.

     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued).        
   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   
   As noted in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash increased due to cash flow from operating
activities increasing $1,366,000 and cash flow from investing activities decreasing $575,000. The increase in Other Current assets, exclusive of cash, resulted primarily from $634,000 of annual insurance premiums paid during the first quarter
or fiscal 2017.   Current liabilities increased primarily as a result of an $899,000 increase in accrued marketing programs. Accrued
marketing programs rose as a result of accruals for an ongoing marketing program for manufactured housing customers. Accruals are made monthly, and the majority of payments are made during the Corporation s fourth fiscal quarter.  
 Capital expenditures totaled $569,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to $70,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The
increase is the result of building improvements, purchasing equipment for the Elkhart, Indiana facility, and replacing equipment that had reached its full economic useful life.  
 If necessary, the Corporation has the ability to borrow money under the Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and against the cash surrender
value of certain life insurance policies.     Impact of Inflation   
 The consolidated financial statements included in this report reflect transactions in the dollar values in which they were incurred and,
therefore, do not attempt to measure the impact of inflation. On a long-term basis, the Corporation has adjusted selling prices in reaction to changing costs due to inflation. 
  Forward Looking Information     The
preceding Management s Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are also made elsewhere in this report. The
Corporation publishes other forward-looking statements from time to time.   Statements that are not historical in nature, including those
containing words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   should,   expect,   believe,   intend,  and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We caution to
be aware of the speculative nature of  forward-looking statements.

Item 2.  
     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   (Continued).        

Forward Looking Information   (Continued)   
   
  Although these statements reflect the Corporation s good faith belief based on current expectations,
estimates, and projections about (among other things) the industry and the markets in which the Corporation operates, they are not guarantees of future performance.  
 Whether actual results will conform to management s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of known and unknown risks and
uncertainties, including the following:      

Consumer confidence and economic uncertainty;        

Availability of wholesale and retail financing;        

The health of the U.S. housing market as a whole;        

Regulations pertaining to the housing and park model industries;        

The cyclical nature of the manufactured housing and park model industries;        

General or seasonal weather conditions affecting sales;        

Potential impact of natural disasters on sales and raw material costs;        

Potential periodic inventory adjustments by independent retailers;        

Interest rate levels;        

Impact of inflation;        

Impact of labor costs;        

Competitive pressures on pricing and promotional costs;        

Catastrophic events impacting insurance costs;        

The availability of insurance coverage for various risks to the Corporation;        

Market demographics; and        

Management s ability to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel.    
 Consequently, all of the Corporation s forward-looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements. The Corporation may
not realize the results anticipated by management or, even if the Corporation substantially realizes the results management anticipates, the results may not have the consequences to, or effects on, the Corporation or its business or operations that
management expects. Such differences may be material. Except as required by applicable laws, the Corporation does not intend to publish updates or revisions of any forward-looking statements management makes to reflect new information,
future events or otherwise.

Item 4.  
     Controls and Procedures.           Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     As of August 31, 2016, the Corporation conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the
period ended August 31, 2016 to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required.
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 No change in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act  Rule 13a-15(f))  occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2016 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
    PART II         OTHER INFORMATION       

Item 1.  
     Legal Proceedings:          The Corporation is a party to various pending
legal proceedings in the normal course of business. Management believes that any losses resulting from such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s results of operations or financial position.  

Item 1A.  
     Risk Factors.          There were no material changes in the risk factors
disclosed in Item 1A of the Corporation s Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016.
