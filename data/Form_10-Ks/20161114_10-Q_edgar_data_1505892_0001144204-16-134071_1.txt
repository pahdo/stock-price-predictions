NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

1.   
       The Company and Basis of Presentation    

Business Activity and Organization  The
Company is a Delaware corporation, incorporated on August 17, 1998. POW! Entertainment, Inc. ( POW ,  Company ,
 we ) has the following subsidiaries: POW! Entertainment, LLC (the operating company), QED Productions, LLC, PFD, LLC,
and an inactive Delaware corporation: Pharmelle, Inc. 

We have prepared the Company s accompanying
consolidated unaudited financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, or GAAP, for interim financial statements and with instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Exchange
Act. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of our management, we have included all adjustments considered necessary (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) for a fair presentation. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are
not indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. You should read these unaudited
consolidated financial statements in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in our annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Going Concern Qualifications  

The Company's operation will be sustained through
December 2016 by the promissory note from a party with which the Company has a joint venture and by $183,000 of revenue received
for the show  Lucky Man . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,209,594 and has
a negative working capital balance of approximately $5,300,000. Revenues fluctuate and are uncertain and these conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is currently exploring various other sources
of revenues, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in finding other revenue streams sufficient to support our
operational requirements and we may need to further scale back operations, defer executive salaries and reduce staff members. The
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 do not contain any adjustments to reflect future effects
on the recoverability or classification of assets and liabilities that may result should we not able to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company's assets
and the satisfaction of its liabilities in the normal course of conducting its business. The Company's ability to continue as a
going concern is dependent upon various factors including, among others, its ability to generate income and positive cash flows
from operations.  

2.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Revenue Recognition   As a creator of
intellectual property, the majority of the Company s business is derived from contracts with third parties providing for
the development and use of intellectual property developed by the Company. 

6   

The Company records revenue from these sources: artist
consulting, film rights, animated television and comic-book royalties. In accounting for these contracts, the Company recognizes
revenue when services have been rendered or when contractual parameters have been satisfied and are measureable. 

Use of Estimates   The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the appropriate
application of certain accounting policies, many of which require estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact
on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with
certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the financial statements. 

We have identified the first tier of estimates and
assumptions as significant areas of estimation and assumptions to be the valuation of derivatives liabilities from the utilization
of the Black-Scholes Pricing Model, which has inherent volatility that may greatly differ from the actual results. The second tier
of estimation consists of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the net deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. While
we deem the latter estimates to be significant, their infrequent occurrence in our operations are considered secondary compared
to the first tier. 

Concentration of Credit Risk  The Company
maintains cash at financial institutions which may, at times, exceed insured limits. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  Cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities include cash, certificates of deposit, mutual funds and liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities consist of securities classified as available for sale. 

Accounts Receivable  The Company extends
credit to its customers.  These customers have specific contracts that detail the payments expected under their contract
terms.  Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under these contract terms.  Management reviews accounts
receivable on a regular basis, based on contracted terms and how recently payments have been received, to determine if any such
amounts will potentially be uncollected.  After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written
off. 

Other Receivables  Other receivables are
receivables from third parties deemed collectible. 

Property and Equipment  Property and equipment
are stated at cost.  Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets over three to five years. Depreciation expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $614 and $3,650, respectively. Depreciation expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $2,381 and $10,950, respectively. 

Fair Value Measurements  The Company measures
its financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Additionally, the Company is required to provide disclosure and categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one
of three different levels depending on the assumptions (i.e. inputs) used in the valuation. Level 1 provides the most reliable
measure of fair value while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. Financial assets and liabilities are classified
in their entirety based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined
as follows: 

1.   
      Level I   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.   

2.   
      Level II   Other significant observable inputs for assets or liabilities through corroboration with market data at measurement date.   

3.   
      Level III   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use to price assets or liabilities at the measurement date.   

7   

The following table summarizes fair value measurements
by level at December 31, 2015 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The following table summarizes fair value measurements
by level at September 30, 2016 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in
fair value of the Company s Level III liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company s management believes the carrying
amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expense approximate fair value due to their short maturity. 

Valuation of Derivative Instruments  ASC
815-40 (formerly SFAS No. 133  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities )  requires that
embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on
their issuance date and in accordance with ASC 815-40-15 (formerly EITF 00-19  Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company s Own Stock ) to determine whether they should be considered a derivative
liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses
the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. 

Marketable Securities   The following
tables show the Company s securities classified as available for sale with adjusted cost, unrealized gains (loss), and fair
value by investment category recorded as of December 31, 2015: 

Marketable Securities consisted of $283 in cash and
cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016. 

Loss on Sale of Marketable Securities  The
Company sold securities classified as available for sale with adjusted cost basis of $264,724 for net proceeds of $240,583 with
a loss on sale totaling $24,010 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. There was no sale of marketable securities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    

8   

Other Comprehensive Income  The Company s
other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on securities classified as available for sale that are recorded
as an element of shareholders  equity but are excluded from net income. 

Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted
for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements and income tax returns. The
Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a
portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. 

Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include
the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common share equivalents had been issued
and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is
anti-dilutive. 

Concentrations  The Company has two major
customers that individually exceeded 10% of total revenue and accounted for 89.6% and 86.8% of total revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, four
major customers accounted for 91.8% and individually exceeded 10% of the total revenue. The Company has two major customers that
individually exceeded 10% and accounted for 58.4% of the total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      

Recently Issued or Newly Adopted Accounting Standards  In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The update intends to enhance the
reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information and addresses
certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The new standard affects
all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption
of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity
of the Company. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842), which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in  Leases (Topic 840)  and generally
requires all leases to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a
modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard, if any, on its
Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard will eliminate the transaction- and industry-specific revenue
recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The
revenue recognition standard is required to be applied retrospectively, including any combination of practical expedients as allowed
in the standard. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to our financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial
reporting. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued AS 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends
certain aspects of the Board s new revenue standard, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The standard
should be adopted concurrently with adoption of ASU 2014-09 which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing
financial reporting. 

9   

In August 2014, the FASB issued FASB ASU2014-15, Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern. FASB ASU 2014-15 changes to the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as
a going concern. These changes require an entity s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
after the date that financial statements are issued. Substantial doubt is defined as an indication that it is probable that an
entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that financial statements are issued.
If management has concluded that substantial doubt exists, then the following disclosures should be made in the financial statements:
(i) principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, (ii) management s evaluation of the significance
of those conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations, (iii) management s
plans that alleviated the initial substantial doubt or, if substantial doubt was not alleviated, management s plans that
are intended to at least mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, and (iv) if the latter in (iii) is
disclosed, an explicit statement that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
These changes become effective for the Company for the 2016 annual period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
a material impact on the consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to adoption, this guidance will need to be applied by management
at the end of each annual period and interim period therein to determine what, if any, impact there will be on the consolidated
financial statements in a given reporting period. 

3.   
       Advances Payable    

The contract with Silver Creek contained recoupable
advance payments per annum of $550,000 for five years. The agreement ended December 31, 2014. The amounts were recorded by the
Company as advances payable pursuant to the contractual clause in which the advances are recoupable by Silver Creek if at all from
projects in development during the term of the agreement. As of September 30, 2016, cumulative advances received from Silver Creek
were $4,196,667 and such amount remains unchanged. This amount was recoupable by Silver Creek solely from projects which were in
development during the term of the agreement. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no projects  in development  under
the agreement with Silver Creek, so no recoupment payments were owed.    

4.    Deferred Compensation  

Deferred compensation consists of accrued and unpaid
salaries of executives, which will be paid as the Company increases its cash, over time, or by obtaining additional financing.  
The balance at September 30, 2016 reflects payments made during the three months in the amount of $150,000. 

5.   
       Related Party Transactions .   

From time to time, Stan Lee has appeared and will
continue to appear at certain events or projects for which both he and the Company receive payments. There were no fees paid to
Mr. Lee or the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Both Mr. Lee and the Company were paid approximately $20,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company believes that his ability to appear at these events enhances the Company s
brand without additional costs to the Company. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $13,002
was collected from the equity partner from Stan Lee Power Concerts ( SLPC ), which was previously written-off as bad
debt.   

The Company entered into a promissory note for $680,000
from a party with which the Company has a joint venture. The balance currently outstanding is $680,000. The advances bear interest
at the Prime Rate announced by Citibank, N. A., from time to time, and are to be repaid with principal at the maturity date of
December 31, 2016, unless sooner due as a result of a change in control of the Company. The Note may be prepaid, in whole or in
part, at any time without penalty. 

10   

6.   
       Warrants and Options for Non-Employees    

On December 2, 2010, the Company issued warrants to
purchase 350,000 shares of common stock at $0.1905 per share in lieu of the remaining balance of an accrued commission of $125,000
to a consultant. The contract has an anti-dilutive clause, vests immediately and originally was scheduled to expire in 2012 and
was later extended to expire in December 2017. Accordingly, the Company uses the guidance in ASC 815-40-15 to scope and measure
the warrants for non-employees as a derivative liability. 

A loss on change in derivative liability was recorded
to reflect an increase of $1,529 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. A gain on change in derivative liability was recorded
to reflect a decrease of $3,147 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The fair value of stock warrants and options at the
date of grant and derivative liability were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on the following assumptions:  

7.   
       Note Payable    

The Company entered into a promissory note for $680,000
from a party with which the Company has a joint venture. The balance currently outstanding is $680,000. The advances bear interest
at the Prime Rate announced by Citibank, N. A., from time to time, and are to be repaid with principal at the maturity date of
December 31, 2016, unless sooner due as a result of a change in control of the Company. The Note may be prepaid, in whole or in
part, at any time without penalty. 

8.   
       Commitments and Contingencies    

Legal Proceedings   

From time to time the Company may become involved
in various legal proceedings in the normal conduct of its business.  

On February 14, 2011, the Company and its subsidiary,
QED Productions, LLC, were named in a lawsuit citing, among other things, trademark infringement. The Company filed a motion to
dismiss the lawsuit on March 15, 2011. On August 23, 2012, Judge Wilson of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
California dismissed the case. On October 29, 2014, the dismissal was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. SMI filed
a writ of certiorari to the US Supreme Court on February 12, 2015, which was denied on March 30, 2015. 

On August 11, 2015, Shawn Lukaszewicz
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California against Stan Lee and the Company, among others, alleging multiple
causes of action related to plaintiff's performance of services. Plaintiff was never an employee, independent consultant or other
service provider to the Company, and has no contractual or other relationship with the Company, and the Company believes that such
claims are without merit. The parties have filed a number of motions in Superior Court relating to this matter.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

Some of the statements in the Form 10-Q are forward-looking
statements about what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our current beliefs, goals,
and expectations about matters such as our expected financial position and operating results, our business strategy, and our financing
plans. The forward-looking statements in the Form 10-Q are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the current expectations
of our management concerning future results and events. The forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of
terms such as  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan, 
 foresee,   likely  or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our objectives,
plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance
and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. We cannot guarantee that our forward-looking statements will turn out
to be correct or that our beliefs and goals will not change. Our actual results could be very different from and worse than our
expectations for various reasons. You should review carefully all information, including the discussion of risk factors under  Item
1A: Risk Factors  and  Item 7: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Overview   

The Company is a multimedia development and licensing
company that creates and licenses animated and live-action fantasy and superhero entertainment content and merchandise, leveraging
the creative output and branded image of Stan Lee.  The Company develops originally created franchises for new media
such as mobile, on-line, and videogames, where content is currently in high demand, and for traditional entertainment media such
as feature length films in both live action and animation, DVD, television programming, merchandising and related ancillary markets.
All of the Company s intellectual property, which may include characters and stories, is vertically integrated in that each
property is developed into as many products as possible, to create a branded franchise to accelerate global identity from the synergy
created across various media. 

Currently, the Company
plans to focus on: 

creating project concepts, primarily in the form of story treatments,   

identifying select partners willing to participate in, and/or finance, the development of the Company s projects,   

identifying talented and suitable writers to write scripts for the Company s projects, and   

negotiating agreements for the production of the projects ( i.e  ., the filming of a movie or television series, the creation of games, etc.)    

Going Concern Qualifications  

The Company's operation will be sustained through
December 2016 by the promissory note from a party with which the Company has a joint venture and by $183,000 of revenue received
for the show  Lucky Man . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,209,594 and has
a negative working capital balance of approximately $5,300,000. Revenues fluctuate and are uncertain and these conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

12   

The Company is currently exploring various other sources
of revenues, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in finding other revenue streams sufficient to support our
operational requirements and we may need to further scale back operations, defer executive salaries and reduce staff members. The
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 do not contain any adjustments to reflect future effects
on the recoverability or classification of assets and liabilities that may result should we not able to continue as a going concern. 

Projects in Development  

The Company begins with story ideas from Stan Lee
and, prior to January 2015 presented the ideas to Disney pursuant to the  first look  contract (See  Transactions
with Affiliates of The Walt Disney Company  ) , then third parties (such as writers, directors, producers or studios) to
develop the project at the third party s expense. The Company considers a project to be  in development  once
we have packaged the project and handed the project off to a third party. At that point, the project has left the control of the
Company and is in the purview of the third party. Since the Company does not control the process once it is in the hands of others
it is unable to indicate with much, if any, certainty when that project will be produced or the cost that such other party may
incur to produce it.  The numbers of projects in development tend to vary at any given point in time, but they are in the
15-20 projects range. A majority of projects  in development  are never produced, or are produced only after lengthy
delays. 

We believe that the odds are against the typical project
 in development  being produced because there are a very large number of people who come up with ideas for movies,
television shows, and other forms of entertainment, but only a limited number of entities with the financial and personnel resources
required to produce and distribute these projects. However, we believe that several factors improve the odds of the Company s
projects being produced and, if produced being successful. 

First, Stan Lee s has co-created a large number of very successful characters and projects.   

Second, through Stan Lee, we have established relationships with a variety of well-known writers, directors and producers.      

Third, Stan Lee s natural inclination and focus are on superheroes, action characters and other characters that have potential to become  franchises  (i.e. that lend themselves to sequels, to licensing to other media, to merchandising and to other ancillary opportunities).     

Transactions with Affiliates of The
Walt Disney Company   

Silver Creek Pictures, Inc. ( Silver Creek ),
an affiliate of The Walt Disney Company ( Disney ), entered into an agreement with the Company in 2006 and subsequently
amended (the  Silver Creek Agreement ) pursuant to which, among other things, the Company provided Silver Creek with
a  first look  at all of the Company s creative intellectual property and the right to acquire any such properties,
in Silver Creek s discretion under prescribed terms, and Silver Creek compensated the Company for all properties that were
in development by Silver Creek into revenue producing works pursuant to complex terms, typical in the film and media industry.  

The Silver Creek Agreement provided for Silver Creek
to pay the Company overhead allowance amounts equal to $700,000 per annum from 2010 through 2014, and an additional $550,000 per
annum advance against certain future payments due from Silver Creek.  Silver Creek is entitled to recoup the $550,000
annual payments from proceeds of Company projects, which were in development during the term of the Silver Creek Agreement. At
September 30, 2016, Silver Creek was entitled to $4,196,667 in recoupment payments. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no projects
 in development  under the agreement with Silver Creek, so no recoupment payments were owed. 

13   

The Silver Creek Agreement, including all amendments,
are exhibits to the Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2010 and the foregoing summary is
subject to the actual terms provided therein. 

Additionally, Catalyst Investments, LLC ( Catalyst
Investments ), another Disney affiliate, purchased on December 31, 2009 ten percent of the then-outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company for $2,500,000 (the  Catalyst Investment ). 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates
and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation.
Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates
as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. 

We have identified the first tier of estimates and
assumptions as significant areas of estimation and assumptions to be the valuation of derivatives liabilities from the utilization
of the Black-Scholes Pricing Model, which has inherent volatility that may greatly differ from the actual results. The second tier
of estimation consists of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the net deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. While
we deem the latter estimates to be significant, their infrequent occurrence in our operations are considered secondary compared
to the first tier. 

Results of Operations  

We believe that, due to the complex nature and long
term cycle of our business operations, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. However, it is still important that you review the audited financial
statements filed on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the related notes in addition to thoroughly reading
our current plan of operations. 

For Three Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015  

The Company's revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $250,896, a decrease of $506,246 or 67% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received revenues for the show  Lucky Man  totaling $183,000 and from various
other projects. Our new sources of revenue did not result in similar revenue streams compared to 2015 revenues. Project development
revenues have fluctuated and are uncertain. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net
loss was $269,756 compared to net income of $182,628 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Total operating costs decreased by $59,616, mainly
due to decreases in wages and benefits and professional fees compared to prior year. Other expenses have been held constant compared
to prior year. 

14   

For Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015  

The Company's revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $483,359, a decrease of $1,393,383 or 74% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company received revenues for the show  Lucky Man  and from various other projects. Our new
sources of revenue did not result in similar revenue streams compared to 2015 revenues. Project development revenues have fluctuated
and are uncertain. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net
loss was $1,209,594 compared to net income of $151,456 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Total operating costs decreased by $76,483 mainly due to decreases in wages and benefits. Other expenses
have been held constant compared to prior year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Historically, our liquidity and capital resources
were provided principally through our agreement with Silver Creek Pictures. We have a deficiency in working capital of $5,321,764
and $3,985,553 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, cumulative advances received
from Silver Creek were $4,196,667 and such amount remains unchanged. This amount was recoupable by Silver Creek solely from projects
which were in development during the term of the agreement. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no projects  in development 
under the agreement with Silver Creek, so no recoupment payments were owed. 

The Silver Creek agreement expired in December 2014
and the agreement was not extended. The Company is currently exploring various other sources of revenues, but there can be no assurances
that we will be successful in finding other revenue streams sufficient to support our current operational requirements. During
2015 and 2016, the Company found various strategic new partners to develop new projects which resulted in the revenues received
in 2015 and 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received revenues for the show  Lucky Man  totaling
$183,000 and from various other projects. The revenue sources did not replace the Silver Creek agreement and were one-time revenue
streams. The Company continues to search for new strategic partners. 

The Company entered into a promissory note for $680,000
from a party with which the Company has a joint venture. The balance currently outstanding is $680,000. The advances bear interest
at the Prime Rate announced by Citibank, N. A., from time to time, and are to be repaid on December 31, 2016, unless sooner due
as a result of a change in control of the Company or the Company's bankruptcy. The Note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at
any time without penalty. 

Deferred compensation due to executives totaled $1,077,917
and $1,227,917 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company paid down deferred compensation totaling $150,000. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We are not party to any material off-balance
sheet financing arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

None 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

15   

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer, we evaluated
our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in
the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonable likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

From time to time the Company may become involved
in various legal proceedings in the normal conduct of its business.   

Stan Lee Media, Inc.    

Stan Lee Media, Inc. ( SLM ) was a publicly-traded
entity listed on the NASDAQ during 1999.  SLM operated as a typical dot com company during the dot com bubble, in that
it created and developed new properties and franchises for the internet, in this case under the Stan Lee signature, but without
any sustainable revenue source other than new debt or equity financings.  While Stan Lee was the Chairman of the Board
of Directors and Chief Creative Officer of SLM and Gill Champion was the Chief Operating Officer of SLM, the President and Chief
Executive Officer of SLM was a party who is unrelated to the Company. Stan Lee terminated his employment agreement with SLM in
January 2001 because, among other reasons, SLM had ceased paying him thereunder. 

On July 9, 2007, SLM filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California against Stan Lee, QED and the Company entitled  Stan Lee Media,
Inc. v. Lee, et al. (the  SLM Suit ).    In this suit, SLM sought declaratory relief and asserted claims
for misappropriation of corporate opportunity, breach of contract, civil conspiracy, an accounting for profit, violation of the
Lanham Act, copyright infringement, cyber squatting, and unfair business practices naming various defendants, including the Company.  Specifically,
SLM petitioned the court for an order declaring that SLM is the rightful owner of certain intellectual property and, as such, is
the only entity that can use and benefit from such property. In January 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Central District
of California directed that SLM file a Consolidated Complaint in that Court, consolidating all the litigation pending in that Court.
In February 2011, SLM filed its Consolidated Complaint seeking substantially the same relief sought in the complaint previously
filed and dismissed in New York Federal Court. In March 2011, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the newest complaint on the
grounds that the claims are barred by  res judicata  and statutes of limitation, among other grounds, based in part on the
prior New York decision. On August 23, 2012, Judge Wilson dismissed the case. On October 29, 2014, the dismissal was affirmed by
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. SLM filed a writ of certiorari on February 12, 2015 to the US Supreme Court. On March 30, 2015,
the writ of certiorari was denied by the US Supreme Court. 

On August 11, 2015, Shawn Lukaszewicz
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California against Stan Lee and the Company, among others, alleging multiple
causes of action related to plaintiff's performance of services. Plaintiff was never an employee, independent consultant or other
service provider to the Company, and has no contractual or other relationship with the Company, and the Company believes that such
claims are without merit. The parties have filed a number of motions in Superior Court relating to this matter.
