 1. Basis of Presentation  
 Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our ) design, develop, manufacture and sell precision photonic and motion control components and subsystems to Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs ) in the medical and advanced industrial markets. We combine deep expertise at the intersection of photonics and motion to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and subsystems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers  demanding applications. We deliver highly engineered photonics, vision and precision motion solutions to customers around the world. 
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods.  
 The Company has a 41% ownership interest in Laser Quantum Ltd. ( Laser Quantum ), a privately held company located in the United Kingdom. The Company records the results of this entity under the equity method as it does not have a controlling interest in the entity.  
 The Company s unaudited interim financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31.  
 Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 Statement of Cash Flows Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which provides further clarification on eight cash flow classification issues. The standard further clarifies the classification of the following: (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (vi) distributions received from equity method investees; (vii) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 will become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-15 should be applied using a retrospective transition method for each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.

    Share-Based Compensation  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions to require recognition of the income tax effects resulting from the settlement of stock-based awards as income tax provision or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. In addition, ASU 2016-09 requires that all tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments, including the excess tax benefits related to the settlement of stock-based awards, be classified as cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 also requires that cash paid through directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. In addition, ASU 2016-09 allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, consistent with existing U.S. GAAP, or account for forfeitures when they occur. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 during the second quarter of 2016, which required no retrospective adjustments to the consolidated financial statements.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had an impact of less than $0.1 million on income from continuing operation on the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended July 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had no impact on the prior year consolidated financial statements. 
 Leases 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which provides comprehensive lease accounting guidance. The standard requires entities to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40),  which requires management to assess a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively only to customer contracts not yet completed as of the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized in beginning retained earnings at the date of the initial application. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date,  which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, with the option of early adoption as of the original effective date. The amendment in ASU 2015-14 will result in ASU 2014-09 being effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and plans to adopt the standard beginning in the first quarter of 2018.

2. Business Combinations  
 On May 24, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Reach Technology Inc. ( Reach ), a Fremont, California-based provider of embedded touch screen technology solutions for OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $9.4 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The Company expects that the addition of Reach will enable the Company to enhance its value proposition with medical OEM customers by adding Reach s high-performance touch screen solutions to its product offerings. The Company recognized acquisition costs of $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Acquisition-related costs are included in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs in the consolidated statements of operations.    
 The acquisition of Reach has been accounted for as a business combination. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon a valuation of assets and liabilities acquired. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of Reach and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. The Company s estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regards to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is preliminary. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the final settlement of working capital and the amount of the residual goodwill. 
 Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price was allocated as follows (in thousands):

    As of September 30, 2016, the working capital adjustments had not been finalized and were estimated to be an additional cash payment of $0.2   million which has been included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  
 The fair value of intangible assets is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):

    The purchase price   allocation resulted in $  4  .  9   million of goodwill and $4.0 million of identifiable intangible assets, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based   upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flow potential attributable to: (i) Reach s ability to grow their busine  ss with existing and new customers,   including leveraging the Company s customer base, and   (ii) cost improvements due to scale and more efficient operations.  
 The operating results of Reach were included in the Company s results of operations beginning on May 24, 2016. Reach contributed revenues of $3.2 million and a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Operating loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included transition costs of $0.6 million recognized under earn-out agreements. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of Reach, as if it had been acquired as of January 1, 2015, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2015. Reach is included in the Company s Vision reportable segment. 
 On November 9, 2015, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of Lincoln Laser Company ( Lincoln Laser ), a Phoenix, Arizona-based provider of ultrafast precision polygon scanners and other optical scanning solutions for the medical, food processing, and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $12.1 million, net of working capital adjustments. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company finalized the working capital adjustments with the sellers of Lincoln Laser and received a payment of $0.4 million. 
   
 3. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures 
 In April 2015, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its JK Lasers business, previously included in the Photonics (formerly known as  Laser Products ) reportable segment, for approximately $29.6 million in cash, net of final working capital adjustments and transaction costs. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $19.6 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 under the caption  other income (expense), net.  The JK Lasers business divestiture did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment. 
 In July 2014, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its Scientific Lasers business for approximately $6.5 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. In accordance with the purchase and sale agreement, $1.5 million of the sales proceeds was held in escrow until January 2016. The Company reported the $1.5 million escrow in other current assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. In January 2016, the $1.5 million escrow was released to the Company in full and is reported as cash flow from investing activities of discontinued operations. 
   
 4. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)  
 Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows (in thousands):  

(1)   
 
 The amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

    5. Earnings per Share   
 Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator also includes the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and stock options determined using the treasury stock method. Dilutive effects of contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation when the contingencies have been resolved. For periods in which net losses are generated, the dilutive potential common shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. 
 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):  

Common Stock Repurchases  
 In October 2013, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company s common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company s discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company s common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 172 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million at an average price of $12.48 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 109 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $1.6 million at an average price of $14.93 per share.

    6. Fair Value Measurements   
 ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements,  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable:  

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access.      

Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1.      

Level 3: Unobservable inputs.      

 The Company s cash equivalents are investments in money market accounts, which represent the only asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of our cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities (excluding contingent considerations) approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature.  
 Contingent consideration 
 On December 18, 2015, the Company acquired all assets and certain liabilities of Skyetek Inc. ( Skyetek ). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Skyetek acquisition, the owners of Skyetek are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain sales order commitment targets from October 2015 through June 2017. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to $0.3 million. If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration will be payable in 2017. The Company recognized an estimated fair value of $0.2 million as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is reported as an other current liability and a long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Lincoln Laser acquisition, the shareholders of Lincoln Laser are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets for fiscal year 2016. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to $6.0 million. If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration will be payable in cash in 2017. The estimated fair value of $2.3 million was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. In June 2016, a $0.3 million increase in the estimated fair value was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs. The estimated fair value of $2.6 million for the contingent consideration was reported as an other current liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The estimated fair value of $2.3 million for the contingent consideration was reported as a long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
 On February 19, 2015, the Company acquired Applimotion Inc. ( Applimotion ). The former shareholders of Applimotion are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets for fiscal years 2015 to 2017. The undiscounted range of contingent considerations is zero to $4.0 million. If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration will be payable in cash in two installments in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The estimated fair value of $1.0 million was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. In December 2015 and June 2016, respectively, the Company recorded a $0.4 million and $1.1 million increase in the estimated fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. These adjustments are included in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs. The estimated fair value of $2.5 million for the contingent consideration was reported as an other current liability and a long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 in accordance with the timing of the estimated payments.

9. Debt  
 Debt consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Senior Credit Facilities  
 On May 19, 2016, the Company entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement (the  Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ) with new and existing lenders for an aggregate credit facility of $300.0 million, consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility due in quarterly installments of $1.9 million beginning in July 2016 and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the  Senior Credit Facilities ). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in May 2021. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the amended and restated credit agreement dated December 27, 2012. Quarterly installments due in the next twelve months under the term loan amount to $7.5 million and are classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 The Company incurred $2.5 million in financing costs related to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. These costs are presented as a reduction to debt and will be amortized over the term of the Senior Credit Facilities. 
 The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2016. 
 Liens 
 The Company s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured on a senior basis by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its material United States ( U.S. ) and United Kingdom ( U.K. ) subsidiaries and guaranteed by the Company and its material U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.   
 Fair Value of Debt  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the Company s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of the same maturity.

10. Share-Based Compensation 
 The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in income from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): 

The expense recorded during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively, included $0.5 million related to deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company s Board of Directors. 
 Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units 
 The Company s restricted stock units ( RSUs ) have generally been issued with a three-year or five-year vesting period and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and actual experience. 
 Deferred stock units ( DSUs ) are granted to the members of the Company s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the respective date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. 
 The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.9 million based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of vesting.  
 Performance Stock Units 
 On March 30, 2016, the Company granted 46 thousand performance stock units ( PSUs ) to certain members of the executive management team.  The performance objective is measured using cumulative Non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance cycle.  The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs on a straight-line basis. Compensation expense is determined based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed each quarter. The cumulative effect of the changes in the estimated compensation expense will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. 
 The table below summarizes activities relating to PSUs issued and outstanding under the Company s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Stock Options 
 On March 30, 2016, the Company granted 193 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a price equal to the closing market price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over a three-year period beginning on the anniversary date of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected option term, the expected volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options, the risk-free interest rate, and our expected dividend yield. The Company recognizes the compensation expense of stock options on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period.  
 The table below summarizes activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: 

(1)   
 
 The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method provided by Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14:  Share-Based Payment .    

(2)   
 
 The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the expected option term.    

(3)   
 
 Risk-free interest rate was based upon treasury instrument whose term was one year longer than the expected option term.    

(4)   
 
 The expected annual dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends.    

The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.0 million.

11. Income Taxes  
 The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted income from continuing operations before income taxes and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date income from continuing operations before income taxes at the end of each interim period. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada s statutory tax rate of 28.5% in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. Effective April 1, 2016, the Canadian statutory tax rate increased from 27.0% to 29.0%, yielding a blended statutory rate of 28.5% for the full year. 
 The Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 31.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 28.5% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and losses in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance.  
 The Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 30.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 28.5% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, losses in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance, the Laser Quantum dividend distribution and the impact of other discrete items for the period. The Company received a tax free cash dividend of $2.3 million from Laser Quantum in March 2016, which had a 1.9% favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 The Company s effective tax rates on income from continuing operations of 27.2% and 26.3%, respectively, for the three and nine month periods ended October 2, 2015 differ from the Canadian statutory rate of 27.0% due to the gain from JK Lasers divestiture, the audit settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ), mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, losses in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance, and the impact of discrete items for the periods. 
 The Company maintains a valuation allowance on some of its deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  
   
 12. Restructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs  
 The following table summarizes restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):  

2016 Restructuring 
   During the third quarter of 2015, the Company initiated the 2016 restructuring program, which includes consolidating certain of our manufacturing operations to optimize our facility footprint and better utilize resources, costs associated with discontinuing our radiology product line and reducing redundant costs due to productivity cost savings and business volume reductions. We substantially completed the 2016 restructuring program during the second quarter of 2016. In August 2016, the Company sold our facility in

The Company expects to incu  r additional restructuring charges of $0.3 million to $0.4 million related to the 2016 restructuring plan.  
 The following table summarizes restructuring costs for each segment and unallocated corporate and shared services related to the 2016 restructuring plan (in thousands): 

2015 Restructuring 
 During the first quarter of 2015, the Company initiated a program to eliminate redundant costs, as a result of acquisition and divestiture activities, to better align our operations to our strategic growth plans, to further integrate our business lines, and as a consequence of our productivity initiatives. During the nine months ended October 2, 2015, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $1.5 million related to the 2015 restructuring plan.

 2011 Restructuring  
 In November 2011, the Company announced a strategic initiative ( 2011 restructuring ), which aimed to consolidate operations to reduce the Company s cost structure and improve operational efficiency. As part of this initiative, the Company eliminated facilities through the consolidation of certain manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities and the exit of Semiconductor and Laser Systems businesses. The Company substantially completed the 2011 restructuring program by the end of 2013. In March 2016, the Company sold our previously exited facility located in Orlando, Florida for cash at the net carrying value of $3.5 million. Restructuring costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included facility costs related to the Orlando, Florida facility. These costs were recorded in the Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segment.

 Guarantees and Indemnifications  
 In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of our officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors  and officers  liability insurance to be maintained by the Company.

Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: the PMI may not provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial end market in any particular period or at all; economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers  businesses and level of business activity; our significant dependence upon our customers  capital expenditures, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations; our dependence upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand; our ability to continually innovate and successfully commercialize our innovations; failure to introduce new products in a timely manner; customer order timing and other similar factors beyond our control; disruptions or breaches in security of our information technology systems; changes in interest rates, credit ratings or foreign currency exchange rates; risk associated with our operations in foreign countries; our increased use of outsourcing in foreign countries; our failure to comply with local import and export regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; violations of our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties; risk of losing our competitive advantage; our failure to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions into our businesses or grow acquired businesses; our ability to make divestitures that provide business benefits; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; our restructuring and realignment activities and disruptions to our operations as a result of consolidation of our operations; product defects or problems integrating our products with other vendors  products; disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers; production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions; our compliance, or our failure to comply, with various federal, state and foreign regulations; changes in governmental regulation of our business or products; effects of compliance with conflict minerals regulations; our compliance, or failure to comply, with environmental regulations; our failure to implement new information technology systems and software successfully; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets; our exposure to the credit risk of some of our customers and in weakened markets; our reliance on third party distribution channels; changes in tax laws, and fluctuations in our effective tax rates; being subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though we are a non-U.S. corporation; any need for additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; volatility in the market price for our common shares; our ability to access cash and other assets of our subsidiaries; the influence of certain significant shareholders over our business; provisions of our articles of incorporation may delay or prevent a change in control; our significant existing indebtedness may limit our ability to engage in certain activities; and our failure to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future. Other important risk factors that could affect the outcome of the events set forth in these statements and that could affect the Company s operating results and financial condition are discussed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and in Item 1A of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 under the heading  Risk Factors.

 24 

End Markets  
 We primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market.  
 Advanced Industrial Market 
 As of September 30, 2016, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 60% of the Company s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 
 Medical Market 
 As of September 30, 2016, the medical market accounted for approximately 40% of the Company s revenue. Our revenue from products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other health care provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customers or patient preferences, and general demographic trends.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a gain of $1.6 million, net of expenses, and costs of $3.0 million, respectively, related to the 2016 restructuring plan. We recognized a gain of $1.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the sale of our facility in Chatsworth, California. The Company expects to incur additional restructuring charges of $0.3 million to $0.4 million related to the 2016 restructuring plan in the next twelve months. 
   
 Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended October 2, 2015 
 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:  

Overview of Financial Results  
 Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 6.0% and 0.9%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The net effect of our acquisition and divestiture activities resulted in an increase in revenue of 2.2% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a decrease in revenue of 0.1% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by 0.6% and 0.3% during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
 26 

Operating income from continuing operations   in  creased $  2.0   million, or   22.7%  , from $  9  .  0   million for the three months   ended   October 2  , 201  5   to   $  11.0   million     for the three months ended   September 30  , 201  6  .   This   in  crease   was primarily attributable to an increase in   gross profit of $1.  3   million as a result of higher revenue and a decrease in   restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs   of $2.2 million primarily due to   a $1.6 million gain from   the sale of   our Chatsworth, California facility  , partially offset by a  n in  crease in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses     of   $1.0 million primarily due to CEO transition costs.  
 Operating income from continuing operations decreased $3.5 million, or 14.1%, from $24.7 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 to $21.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in gross profit of $1.7 million as a result of the write-down of inventories related to the discontinuation of our radiology products and an increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $1.6 million related to our current year restructuring programs and changes in the fair value of contingent considerations from prior year acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in SG A expenses of $0.6 million. 
 Diluted earnings per share ( Diluted EPS ) from continuing operations of $0.21 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.02 from the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income from continuing operations.  
 Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.43 from the prior year. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating income from continuing operations and lower other income as a result of the $19.6 million gain recognized from the JK Lasers divestiture in the prior year, partially offset by foreign currency gains in the current year versus foreign currency losses in the prior year.

These costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.5 million, or 9.1%, versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in SG A expenses as a result of CEO transition costs, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and acquisition related costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1.3 million, or 7.3%, versus the prior year primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a result of cost savings from prior year restructuring initiatives and lower current year restructuring costs, partially offset by CEO transition costs. 
 Other Income and Expense Items  
 The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (dollars in thousands):  

Interest Income (Expense), Net  
 Net interest expense was $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus $1.2 million in the prior year. The $0.1 million decrease in net interest expense from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.52% during the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus 3.15% for the prior year. The increase in weighted average interest rate was primarily due to higher commitment fees for unused revolving credit facilities.  
 Net interest expense was $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus $4.0 million in the prior year. The $0.5 million decrease in net interest expense from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.49% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus 3.30% for the prior year. 
 Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net  
 Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.2 million net gains for the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus $0.4 million net gains for the prior year due to changes in the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen. 
 Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $1.0 million net gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus $2.3 million net losses for the prior year due to changes in the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen and an unrealized foreign currency loss in the prior year related to the cash proceeds in U.S. dollars from the JK Lasers divestiture being held for a period of time by our UK subsidiary. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net  
   Other income was $0.7 million and $1.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, versus $0.9 million and $21.6 million during the three and nine months ended October 2, 2015, respectively. The decrease in other  
 31 

income   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year   was primarily due to a gain of $19.6 million recognized in the prior year as a result of the JK Lasers divestiture in April 2015  .  
 Income Taxes  
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 31.1%, versus 27.2% for the prior year. The Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 31.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 28.5% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates and losses in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance.  
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 30.3%, versus 26.3% for the prior year. The Company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 30.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 28.5% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, losses in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance, the Laser Quantum dividend distribution and the impact of other discrete items for the period. The Company received a tax free cash dividend of $2.3 million from Laser Quantum in March 2016, which had a 1.9% favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Discontinued Operations 
 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was zero for both the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of zero and less than $0.1 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended October 2, 2015. The small loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was due to losses related to the Scientific Lasers business that was divested in July 2014. 
   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility provides an additional potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. In addition, we may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund major business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  
 Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, and market changes in general. See  Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure  included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary.  
   In October 2013, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase outstanding shares of the Company s common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. The shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company s discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company s common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has cumulatively repurchased an aggregate of 172 thousand shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million at an average price of $12.48  
 32 

per share  .   During the nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016  , the Company repurchased   109   thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of   $1.6   million at an average price of $  14.93   per   share.  
 As of September 30, 2016, $33.9 million of our $64.7 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries. However, in certain instances, we have identified excess cash for which we may repatriate and we have established deferred tax liabilities for the expected tax cost. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. 
 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement  
 In May 2016, we entered into the second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the  Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ), consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the  Senior Credit Facilities ). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in May 2021. As of September 30, 2016, we had term loans of $73.1 million and revolving loans of $10.0 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities.  
 The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio, and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant requirements and our compliance as of September 30, 2016:  

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015  
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations, cash and cash equivalent balances and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):  

Operating Cash Flows  
 Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $34.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus $25.5 million for the prior year. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased from the prior year primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, gain on disposal of business, gain on sale of fixed assets, acquisition related costs recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions and, the dividend from equity method investment. 
 Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding which increased from 41 days at December 31, 2015 to 45 days at September 30, 2016 and by a decrease in inventories, excluding inventories from the Reach acquisition, as our inventory turnover ratio increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2015 to 3.8 at September 30, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by the higher amount of sales occurring later in the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended December 31, 2015. 
   Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding from 46 days at December 31, 2014 to 48 days at October 2, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding from 51 days at December 31, 2014 to 55 days at October 2, 2015 and an increase in inventories, excluding inventories sold as part of the  
 33 

JK Lasers divestiture and inventories from the Applimotion acquisition. In addition, cash provided by operating activities of continu  ing operations was   negatively   impacted by the   higher amount   of sales   occurring later   in the thr  ee months ended October 2, 2015     versus   the three months ended December 31, 2014  .   
 Investing Cash Flows  
 Cash used in investing activities of our continuing operations was $8.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash provided of $12.5 million during the nine months ended October 2, 2015. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily related to $9.4 million cash consideration paid for the Reach acquisition in May 2016 and $7.0 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by $3.6 million in net cash consideration received from the sale of our Orlando, Florida facility in March 2016, $3.4 million in net cash consideration received from the sale of our Chatsworth, California facility in August 2016, and $0.4 million received from the finalization of the Lincoln Laser acquisition working capital adjustments. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 was primarily due to cash proceeds of 29.6 million received from the sale of the JK Lasers business in April 2015, partially offset by cash consideration of $13.0 million paid for the Applimotion acquisition in February 2015 and $4.1 million in capital expenditures. 
 Cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily related to a $1.5 million release of escrow related to our July 2014 Scientific Lasers divestiture. 
 We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $8 million for the full year 2016. 
 Financing Cash Flows  
 Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $21.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, consisting of $5.6 million of contractual term loan payments, $8.8 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $1.7 million of payroll withholding tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, $1.6 million of repurchases of the Company s common stock, and $0.9 million of capital lease payments. We also paid $2.5 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement signed in May 2016. 
 Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $8.4 million during the nine months ended October 2, 2015, consisting of $5.6 million of contractual term loan payments, $13.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $1.0 million of repurchases of the Company s common stock, partially offset by $13.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the Applimotion acquisition. The Company also made $1.4 million of payroll withholding tax payments on stock-based compensation awards and $0.4 million of capital lease payments. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations  
 Contractual Obligations  
 Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest associated with our debt, operating and capital leases, purchase commitments and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. In May 2016, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides an aggregate credit facility of $300.0 million, consisting of a $75.0 million 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility. The following table summarizes contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 related to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (in thousands):

        As of   September 30  , 2016, a total   of   $73.1   million of term loan debt and $1  0  .0 million   of revolving credit facility borrowings were outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. The term loan is payable in   19   quarterly installments of $1.9 million with the remaining amount due upon maturity in May 2021. The revolving credit facility is du  e upon maturity in May 2021.

 For the purpose of this calculation, the effective interest rates as of September 30, 2016 have been applied to all future periods.    

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 The Company has an equity method investment in Laser Quantum Ltd. ( Laser Quantum ), a privately held company located in the United Kingdom. The Company has an ownership interest of approximately 41% in the Laser Quantum business. We continue to recognize our share of the earnings of this entity under the equity method.  
 Through September 30, 2016, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons.  
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
 The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than the migration of our Photonics segment s laser beam delivery product line to the Company s primary ERP system.

P  ART II OTHER INFORMATION   
   
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
 The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations.  
   
     Item 1A. Risk Factors  
 The Company s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors , of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Other than the risk mentioned below, there have been no other material changes in the risks affecting the Company since the filing of such Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The results of the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the price of common shares. 
 We are a multinational company with worldwide operations, including business operations and investments in the United Kingdom and Europe. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. 
 These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. If the United Kingdom and the European Union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other European Union member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common shares. 
   
     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
 The following table sets forth certain information with respect to repurchases of the Company s common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

For purposes of this Section 23(c),    Release Expiration Date    shall mean the date that is twenty-one (21) days following the date upon which the Company timely delivers the Release to the Executive, or, in the event that the Executive s termination of employment is  in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program  (as such phrase is defined in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967), the date that is forty-five (45) days following such delivery date.  To the extent that any payments of nonqualified deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) due under this Agreement as a result of the Executive s termination of employment are delayed pursuant to this Section 23(c), such amounts shall be paid in a lump sum on the first payroll date to occur on or after the 60 th  day following the date of Executive s termination of employment, provided that Executive executes and does not revoke the Release prior to such 60 th  day (and any applicable revocation period has expired).

The Executive s obligations under this Section 24 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 19 

termination or forfeiture ob  ligation described in Section 12  .5(a) of the 2010 Incentive Award Plan and the Executive shall not be required, and no award under such plan shall be conditioned on requiring Executive, to enter into any other agreement to the contrary.  
  25.    Full Settlement  . The Company s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.

  26.    Conflicts  . To the extent this Agreement describes equity awards that shall be issued pursuant to the 2010 Incentive Award Plan, such equity awards shall be subject to the 2010 Incentive Award Plan;   provided   that, in the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained herein and a term or provision of the 2010 Incentive Award Plan, the applicable term or provision of this Agreement will govern and prevail.

 Re:   Transition and Release of Claims Agreement  
 Dear John: 
 This letter agreement (this   Letter Agreement  ), entered into on the date first set forth above (the   Effective Date  ), sets forth the understanding by and between you and Novanta Inc. (f/k/a GSI Group Inc.) (collectively with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and any successor(s) thereto, the   Company  ), regarding the cessation of your employment with the Company and the transition of your role as Chief Executive Officer of the Company to your successor.   

1.   
 
  Separation Date and Transition Services .      

 a.  Your active employment with the Company will terminate on September 1, 2016 (the   Separation Date  ) and, as of the Separation Date, you will cease to be an employee, officer and director of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Until the Separation Date, that certain Employment Agreement by and between the Company and you, dated as of November 16, 2010 (the   Employment Agreement  ) will continue to control with respect to your salary, benefits and other matters with respect to your employment with the Company; provided that you agree that during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the Separation Date you will (i) continue to perform your duties as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, consistent with past practices, unless otherwise requested by the Board of Directors of Novanta Inc. (the   Board  ), (ii) use your reasonable best efforts to advance the interests of the Company and facilitate the successful transition of your responsibilities to the individual who succeeds you as Chief Executive Officer in whatever reasonable capacity may be requested by the Board, consistent with your current position as Chief Executive Officer, and (iii) communicate a message consistent with the Board s direction to key employees, customers and suppliers. You acknowledge and agree that, effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern time, on the Separation Date, you hereby (A) resign as Chief Executive Officer and as an employee of the Company and from all offices and positions you may hold at the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries and (B) resign as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, and as a member of the boards of directors and any equivalent bodies of the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
   b.  During the period commencing on the Separation Date and ending on December 31, 2016 (or such earlier date on which you commence employment for a third party) (the   Consulting Period  ), you will continue to serve the Company in such capacities and perform such duties as may be specified from time to time by the Board.  In particular, you agree that you shall continue to facilitate the successful transition of your responsibilities to the individual who  

succeeds   you   as Chief Executive Officer   and, if requested, provide the Company with strategic advice with respect to its ongoing business operations.    In connection   with your services during the Consulting Period, you   shall make   yourself   reasonably     available (  in person,   by telephone or otherwise) to consult with the   Board and the Company s executive officers  . In addition,   you   shall make   yourself   available to travel in connection with   your   services if reasonably requested by the Board and any   reasonable   travel expenses associated therewith shall be reim  bursed in accordance with the Company s applicable policies. You   shall report to the Board   during the Consulting Period. Except as set forth in Section 2, you shall not be entitled to any fees or other compensation in exchange for your services during the Consulting Period.    The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Company intends to require   you   to, and   you intend   to, perform services during the Consulting   Period   at a level equal     to or less than 20% of   your   average level of service previously performed for the Company     during the 36-month period immediately preceding the   Separation   Date.  
 Your services described in Sections 1(a) and (b) are herein referred to, collectively, as the   Transition Services .    

2.   
 
  Severance Benefits .  In addition to any payments and benefits due to you pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Employment Agreement, you will, subject to (and in consideration for) your provision of the Transition Services through the end of the Consulting Period, your execution and non-revocation of the Waiver and Release of Claims Agreement attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (the   Release  ) and your continued compliance with the restrictive covenants (as described in Section 3 below), be entitled to receive payments and benefits set forth in Section 5(b) of the Employment Agreement as if your employment was terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) (collectively, the   Severance Benefits  ). The Severance Benefits shall be subject to the terms of the Employment Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 24 of the Employment Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, will consist of (a) continued base salary for 18 months following the Separation Date, which equals an aggregate amount of $912,426, (b) a prorated 2016 Annual Bonus (as defined in the Employment Agreement) based on actual individual and Company performance goals, and (c) prorated vesting of certain equity awards, which will result in you holding, after taking into account the vesting described in this Section 2(c), 36,590 vested restricted share units under the restricted stock unit awards granted to you on March 3, 2014, February 26, 2015 and March 30, 2016, a vested option to purchase 12,797 common shares of the Company under the option granted to you on March 30, 2016, and 4,796 performance share units under the performance stock unit award granted to you on March 30, 2016.  Other than the equity awards described in the immediately preceding sentence, all Company equity-based compensation awards held by you will be forfeited.         

3.   
 
  Restrictive Covenants .  You acknowledge that the Company is providing you with the Severance Benefits in material part in consideration for your reaffirmation of your prior agreement to comply with the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 6 of the Employment Agreement and that, in accordance with Section 5(d) of the Employment Agreement, no payment will be made, and no acceleration of vesting shall occur, pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Employment Agreement following the date that you first violate any of Section 6(a), (b), (d) or (e) of the Employment Agreement.    

 2 

4.   
 
        Release  .    The Severance Benefits   are   contingent upon and subject to your execution and non-revocation of the Release following the Separation Date in accordance with   Sections 5(b) and 24(c) of the Employment Agreement  , and you agree to sign and be bound by the Release which   will   be considered an integral part of this Letter Agreement.           

5.   
 
  Entire Agreement .  This Letter Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter set forth herein and supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written agreements or understandings between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter hereof;  provided , that, for the avoidance of doubt, (a) you will retain your rights under the terms of the Employment Agreement, except to the extent such terms result in duplication of compensation or benefits to you, and (b) the provisions of the Employment Agreement which by their terms survive termination of employment (including, without limitation, the indemnity obligations and the restrictive covenants set forth in Sections 3(j) and 6 of the Employment Agreement, respectively) will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms (as may be amended by this Letter Agreement).

 Novanta and the Executive are parties to that certain Employment Agreement, dated as of February 10, 2011 (the   Employment Agreement  ).    

B.   
 
 Novanta and the Executive desire to amend the Employment Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Amendment.     

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree that the Employment Agreement shall be modified and amended as follows, effective as of the Amendment Date: 

1.   
 
 The following shall be added as Section 3(i) of the Employment Agreement:     

   Retention Equity Award  .   On August 2, 2016, Novanta shall grant the Executive 80,000 restricted stock units pursuant to the 2010 Incentive Award Plan (  Retention RSUs  ).  The terms and conditions of the Retention RSUs shall be set forth in a written award agreement between Novanta and the Executive, which shall provide that, subject to Executive s continued employment with the Company, (i) the Retention RSUs shall vest on August 2, 2021, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing Section 3(i)(i), the Retention RSUs shall become fully vested immediately prior to a Change in Control, and shall contain other customary terms and conditions. Prior to vesting, the Retention RSUs shall not be transferable and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be subject to forfeiture upon the Executive s termination of employment with the Company.  

2.   
 
 Section 5(a) of the Employment Agreement is hereby removed and replaced in its entirety with the following:    

     In General .  Upon a termination of the Executive s employment for any reason, (i) the Executive (or the Executive s estate) shall be entitled to receive: (A) any portion of the Executive s Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination not theretofore paid, (B) any expenses owed to the Executive under Section 3(g), (C) any accrued but unused vacation pay owed to the Executive pursuant to Section 3(f), and (D) any amount arising from the Executive s participation in, or benefits under, any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements under Section 3(e), which amounts shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such  

employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements  , and (ii) unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Executive shall, effective as of the Date of Termination, resign from all positions held at the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any positions as an officer or director).

3.   
 
 For purposes of Sections 5(b)(iii) and 5(c)(ii) of the Employment Agreement, each reference to  2011 RSUs  shall be removed and replaced in its entirety with  Retention RSUs .      

4.   
 
 Section 8 of the Employment Agreement is hereby removed and replaced in its entirety with the following:    

   8.      Parachute Payments  
 (a)  In the event it shall be determined that (i) any payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the Executive under this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in Control or other change in control or any person affiliated with the Company or such person (the   Payment   and collectively, the   Payments  ) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar federal, state or local tax that may hereafter be imposed) or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (collectively, such excise tax, together with any such interest or penalties, the   Excise Tax  ) and (ii) the amount of all the Payments that Executive would retain after all federal, state and local income taxes, Executive s share of employment taxes, and the Excise Tax on the Payments would be less than the amount Executive would retain after all such taxes if the total amount of the Payments were reduced to an amount equal to one dollar less than the minimum amount which would result in the Payments becoming subject to the Excise Tax (such reduced amount, the   Safe Harbor Amount  ), then the total amount of the Payments that shall be payable to Executive shall be reduced to an amount equal to the Safe Harbor Amount.  The Payments shall be reduced by the Company in its reasonable discretion in the following order: (A) reduction of any cash severance payments otherwise payable to the Executive that are exempt from Section 409A, (B) reduction of any other cash payments or benefits otherwise payable to the Executive that are exempt from Section 409A, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A, (C) reduction of any other payments or benefits otherwise payable to the Executive on a pro-rata basis or such other manner that complies with Section 409A, but excluding any payment attributable to the acceleration of vesting and payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A, and (D) reduction of any payments attributable to the acceleration of vesting or payment with respect to any equity award that is exempt from Section 409A, in each case beginning with payments that would otherwise be made last in time.

The Tax Advisor shall be   selected by the   Company     in its good faith discretion, following consultation with its independent auditors and the Executive.    Any fees incurred as a result of work performed by   the Tax Advisor pursuant to this Section 8   shall be paid by the   Company.  
 (c)  For purposes of any analysis required by this Section 8, (i) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the determination is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive s residence on the date of the determination is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes, (ii) no portion of the Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of the Tax Advisor, does not constitute a  parachute payment  within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including, without limitation, by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code), (iii) in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of the Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of Tax Advisor, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the  base amount  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iv) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Payments shall be determined by the Tax Advisor in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.  

5.   
 
 Section 25 of the Employment Agreement is hereby removed and replaced in its entirety with the following:    

     25.    Compensation Recovery Policy .  The Executive acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent the Company adopts any clawback or similar policy pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including, without limitation, any listing rules or standards resulting therefrom), he shall take all action necessary or appropriate to comply with such policy (including, without limitation, entering into any further agreements, amendments or policies necessary or appropriate to implement and/or enforce such policy). For the avoidance of doubt, other than as provided in this Agreement (including, this Section 25), or as otherwise required by applicable law or by the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which shares of the Company s capital stock are listed, quoted or traded, no vested equity award described in this Agreement shall be subject to any payment, termination or forfeiture obligation described in Section 12.5(a) of the 2010 Incentive Award Plan and the Executive shall not be required, and no award under such plan  
 3 

shall be conditioned on requiring Executive, to enter into any other agreement to the contrary.     

6.   
 
 Except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the Employment Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue in full force and effect according to its terms.    

7.   
 
  This Amendment shall be governed, construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction, and where applicable, the laws of the United States, that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.     

8.   
 
  This Amendment may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
