and Basis of Presentation; Going Concern  

Business and Operations   

Loton, Corp ( we, 
 us,   our  or the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December
28, 2009. The Company s mission is to aggregate live music and content driven by live music through mutually beneficial relationships
with the world s top talent, music companies, festivals and promoters and to provide fans with the opportunity to see their
favorite festivals, concerts and experiences on any screen they choose across all video platforms and devices from mobile to home. 

The Company also owns
a 50% interest in Obar Camden Holdings Ltd. ( Obar Camden  or  OCHL ), a private limited company registered
in England and Wales that engages in the operations of a nightclub and live music venue  KOKO  in Camden, London, England. 

Basis of Presentation   

The interim condensed
consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments
and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are ordinary and necessary for a fair
presentation of results for the interim periods.  Certain information and footnote disclosures required under the accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The Company believes that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The condensed consolidated balance sheet information as of
March 31, 2016 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on July 19, 2016 (the  2016 Annual Report ). These condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 and notes thereto
included in the 2016 Annual Report. 

The results of operations
for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire
fiscal year or for any other period. 

The Company s condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 presented herein have been restated to
present the Company s investment in OCHL on the equity basis of accounting and to correct for other prior errors. Please
see Note 3   Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements for additional details. 

Forward Stock Split   

In
September 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 forward stock split of the Company s common stock
in the form of a dividend. As of September 28, 2016 ,  the shares of the Company s
common stock began trading on the OTC Pink at the new split-adjusted price. The stock split entitled each of the Company s
stockholders as of September 22, 2016, the record date, to receive one additional share of common stock for each one share owned.
Additional shares issued as a result of the stock split were distributed on September 27, 2016, the payment date. The Company s
stockholders did not need to exchange existing stock certificates and received a new certificate reflecting the newly issued shares.
All shares and pre-share amounts have been restated as of the earlier periods presented to reflect the stock split. 

Revenue
Policy   

The Company is primarily engaged in the emerging live and digital music space, including delivery of live
music events and live music streaming, through LiveXLive, Corp., its operating subsidiary. The Company recognizes revenue from
its live events and show productions when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(ii) the show or live event has been completed and occurred and there are no future production obligations, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.   

Going Concern   

The Company s consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, and which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in its consolidated
financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficit of $4,447,721 at September 30, 2016, and incurred a net loss of
$3,550,119, and utilized net cash of $1,957,841 in operating activities for the six month-period then ended. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s independent
public accounting firm in its audit report to the financial statements included in the 2016 Annual Report expressed substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern 

Management estimates that
the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through December 31, 2016. The Company s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its strategy and on its ability to raise additional funds. The Company s
management is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate
the Company s business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will
be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue
restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for the Company s stockholders,
in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing. 

Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies
and Practices  

Use of Estimates and Assumptions   

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s). Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing
currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such
evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates include those related to assumptions used in impairment testing of long term assets, accruals for potential
liabilities and valuing equity instruments issued for services. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

financial statements include all accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and/or entities as of reporting period

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company follows the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and to measure the fair value
of its financial instruments. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The three levels of fair value hierarchy are
described below: 

Level 1  
       
      Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level 2  
       
      Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.   

Level 3  
       
      Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial assets are considered
Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and
at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. 

The carrying amounts of
the Company s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and
other current liabilities, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Investment in
Unconsolidated Subsidiary Under the Equity Method   

The
Company accounts for investments in which the Company owns more than 20% of the investee using the equity method in accordance
with ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Under the equity method, an investor initially records
an investment in the investee at cost, and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor s share
of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition. The amount of the adjustment is included in the determination
of net income by the investor, and such amount reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated statements
including adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between investor
cost and underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment. The investment of an investor is also adjusted
to reflect the investor s share of changes in the investee s capital. Dividends received from an investee reduce the
carrying amount of the investment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in
value of the investment has occurred which is other than temporary and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value
is in excess of what would otherwise be recognized by application of the equity method. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company periodically
issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing
costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance
provided by FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in
accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement
date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to
determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest, they are valued on each vesting
date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date
of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are
immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. 

The fair value of the
Company s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain
assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future
dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, and
based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation
expense recorded in future periods. 

Income taxes   

The Company follows the
asset and liability method which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. 

The estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary. 

Management makes judgments
as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax
liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by
tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. The Company s tax
years 2011 to 2014 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.  

Pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 ( Section 382 ), certain ownership changes may subject the net operating losses  (the
 NOLs ) to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the NOL. Section 382 imposes limitations on a corporation s
ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an  ownership change.  In general terms, an ownership change may result from
transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over
a three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, utilization of the NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under
Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of its stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt
rate. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. The imposition of this limitation on its ability to use
the NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause the Company to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than if such limitation
were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. 

Loss Per Share   

Basic loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock
that then shared in the loss of the Company. In computing diluted loss per share, the treasury stock method assumes that outstanding
options and warrants are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.
Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common
stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants. 

At September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company had 705,000 and 3,050,000 warrants outstanding, respectively, which were excluded from the loss per share
calculation, as they were anti-dilutive. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition
standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle
based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value
of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes
in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively
or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU
2014-09 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

In August, 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide
certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter,
with early adoption permitted. 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a
corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for
all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective
transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company
is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures. 

Other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated
financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

Note 3   Restatement of Prior Period
Financial Statements  

Our financial statements
for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 have been restated. On July 11, 2016, our Board of Directors determined that
the transactions under the Agreement (as defined below) were erroneously accounted for as a reverse acquisition for accounting
purposes and that OCHL was improperly included in consolidation as our subsidiary. OCHL should have been reflected as an investment
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This determination was based on an analysis by our management that we did
not have sufficient control of OCHL at the date of the transaction in accordance with the current accounting rules. Therefore,
our results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
on November 23, 2015 are being restated herein to properly present the Merger (as defined below) and our investment in OCHL on
the equity basis of accounting and correct the prior period for other errors. 

Specifically, on April
28, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Agreement ), by and among our Company, Loton Acquisition
Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary ( Acquisition Sub ), and KOKO (Camden) Holdings
(US), Inc. ( KOKO Parent ), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of JJAT Corp. ( JJAT ),
a Delaware corporation wholly-owned by Robert Ellin, our Executive Chairman, President, a director and controlling stockholder),
and his affiliates (the  Merger ). As a result of the Merger, KOKO Parent became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and our
then primary business became that of KOKO Parent and its subsidiaries, KOKO (Camden) Limited, a private limited company registered
in England and Wales ( KOKO UK ), which owns 50% of OCHL, which in turn wholly-owns its operating subsidiary OBAR Camden.
Upon the closing of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, KOKO Parent s former sole shareholder, JJAT,
received 58,000,000 shares of our common stock. Since both we and JJAT were controlled by Mr. Ellin at the time of the consummation
of the Merger, this reverse merger transaction should have been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.
Accordingly, this equity method investment should have been initially measured on our financial statements at its then JJAT s historical
basis of $4.2 million.

Note 4   Equity Investments in OCHL  

On April 28, 2014, the
Company acquired a 50% equity interest in OCHL, an entity that owns Obar Camden Limited (OCL), a music and entertainment company
whose principal business is the operation of a live music venue and nightclub known as KOKO, located in Camden, London. KOKO provides
live shows, club nights, corporate and other events at KOKO. The Company acquired its 50% interest through the issuance of 58,000,000
shares of its common stock to the seller, JJAT, an entity wholly owned by Mr. Ellin. Since both the Company and JJAT
were controlled by Mr. Ellin at the time of this transaction, the transaction was accounted for as a transaction between related
parties at the related parties  original basis. Accordingly, the Company recorded the equity method investment at $4.2 million
which is JJAT s historical basis in OCHL. 

As part of the transaction, the
Company was to be reimbursed $494,750 by OCHL for legal and other acquisition costs incurred in relation to the acquisition
of the 50% interest. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the outstanding advances due to the Company were $213,331
and $213,331, respectively. The note bears interest at 8% per annum and was due April 27, 2015. The note is currently in default. 

The OCHL Shareholders  Agreement  

On February 12, 2014,
(1) Mr. Bengough, and (2) KOKO UK, Mr. Ellin and Trinad Capital Master Fund (collectively, the  Ellin Parties ) and
(3) OCHL entered into a Shareholders  Agreement (the  OCHL Shareholders  Agreement ) pursuant to which,
among other terms, the parties agreed that each of Mr. Ellin and Mr. Bengough shall constitute the Board of Directors of OCHL and
each shall be restricted from taking actions on behalf of OCHL without the written consent of the other individual, including,
but not limited to, changes in the nature of the business, amendments to governing documents, restructuring or recapitalizations,
issuances of stock, purchases of material assets, entry into material contracts, incurring or guaranteeing debt, removal of any
director or restructure the board of OCHL. Because OCHL is the sole parent of OCL, the Company s ability to manage OCHL and
OCL is subject to the terms of the OCHL Shareholders  Agreement and Mr. Bengough s consent is required for most material
actions to be taken by OCHL and OCL, so long as the OCHL Shareholders  Agreement remains in effect. Each of Mr. Bengough
and Mr. Ellin were entitled to serve on the board of OCHL so long as the OCHL Shareholders  Agreement is in effect, and the
board cannot take action without the consent of both board members. Pursuant to the OCHL Shareholders  Agreement, any cash
distributions by OCHL must be distributed pro rata to each of KOKO UK and Mr. Bengough. In addition, the OCHL Shareholders 
Agreement restricts the transfer of shares in OCHL or OCL by KOKO UK or Mr. Bengough and grants each a right of first refusal and
the right to have the proposed shares valued by an independent accounting firm and sold to the other party at a price determined
by valuation rather than the price necessarily offered by the prospective purchaser. 

On April 24, 2014, the
OCHL Shareholders  Agreement was amended pursuant to the terms of the Variation to Shareholders Agreement ( Variation
Agreement ) among Mr. Bengough, KOKO UK, the Ellin Parties, OCHL, OCL, JJAT and the Company pursuant to which, amongst other
terms, (1) joined OCL, JJAT and the Company as parties to the OCHL Shareholders Agreement and (2) Mr. Bengough agreed to transfer
all of his interests in OCHL in exchange for 58,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to be issued in a private placement
transaction, which would constitute no less than 42.5% of the Company s outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis
(but before the Company s future issuance of up to 6,400,000 shares of its common stock to its advisors, consultants and
key employees as approved by the Company s Board of Directors) and pursuant to the OCHL Shareholders  Agreement, subject
to Mr. Bengough s receipt of satisfactory tax clearances under the tax laws of the United Kingdom. The Company agreed to
indemnify Mr. Bengough from any adverse tax expenses and costs required to be paid by Mr. Bengough in connection with the transfer
of his interests in OCHL. To date, the parties to the Variation Agreement have been unable to reach an agreement on mutually acceptable
documentation to affect the share exchange described above. The Company and Mr. Bengough are presently continuing to co-own OCHL
and OCL with Mr. Bengough leading OCL s day-to-day business. 

The Variation
Agreement and the related OCHL Shareholders  Agreement remain in full force and effect, subject to any court mandated
changes or orders made with respect to the Petition and subject to the completion of the Settlement Transactions (see Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of each). Pursuant to the Consent Order
(see Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies), Mr. Bengough and Richard Griston, a newly appointed independent director
of OCHL, constitute the Board of Directors of OCHL and Mr. Bengough is restricted from taking actions on behalf of OCHL
without the written consent of the Company. 

As of September 30, 2016,
the changes in investments in and advances to equity method investments are summarized as follows: 

The carrying amounts of
the major classes of assets and liabilities of OCHL as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 are as follows:

Note 6   Related Party Notes Payable  

As
of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had the following outstanding notes payable to Trinad Capital Master Fund
( Trinad Capital ), a fund wholly owned by Mr. Ellin, the Company s Executive Chairman, President, director and
majority stockholder, for both short and long term working capital requirements: 

First Senior Note - Trinad Capital Master
Fund   

On December 31, 2014,
the Company entered into a senior convertible promissory note (the  First Senior Note ) with Trinad Capital allowing
for advances up to a maximum loan amount of $1,000,000, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the unpaid principal amount
of outstanding advances. 

At the time the First
Senior Note was made, Trinad Capital advanced $700,000 to the Company and had accrued $70,151 in unpaid interest. Pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Note, all outstanding unpaid principal and accrued interest was originally due and payable on June 30, 2016
or such later date as Trinad Capital may agree to in writing unless, prior to such date, the First Senior Note has been repaid
in full or Trinad Capital elects to convert all or any portion of the then-outstanding loan balance into common stock of the Company
in connection with the Company consummating an equity financing in excess of $5,000,000 or greater as set forth in the terms of
the First Senior Note. Subsequent to the making of the First Senior Note: 

On January 27, 2015, the Company and Trinad Capital entered into an amendment to the First Senior Note, effective as of December 31, 2014, pursuant to which: (1) the term of the First Senior Note was extended to June 30, 2016 and (2) the conversion price for conversion of the unpaid balance and interest outstanding in connection with an equity financing was amended to be the price per share equal to the average price per share paid by investors in the equity financing;   

On February 5, 2015, the Company and Trinad Capital entered into an amendment and restatement of the First Senior Note, effective as of December 31, 2014, pursuant to which the convertibility feature of the note was eliminated in its entirety; and   

As of September 30, 2016
and March 31, 2016, $1,000,000 of principal was outstanding under the First Senior Note. Accrued interest of $170,637 and $140,555
is reflected on the balance sheet as accrued interest payable, related party as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively, 

Second Senior Note - Trinad Capital Master
Fund   

On April 8, 2015, the
Company entered into a second senior promissory note (the  Second Senior Note ) with Trinad Capital in the amount of
$195,500. The Second Senior Note bears interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum and all outstanding unpaid principal
and accrued interest is due and payable on June 30, 2016 or such later date as Trinad Capital may agree to in writing, unless prior
to such date this note has been prepaid in full. During the year ended March 31, 2016, Trinad Capital made advances to the Company
totaling $1,784,000. Subsequent to the making of the Second Senior Note: 

The amount due to Trinad
Capital under the Second Senior Note was $1,784,000 at March 31, 2016. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, Trinad Capital
made additional advances to us under the Second Senior Note totaling $675,100. The Company also made repayments totaling $350,000
during six months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, $2,109,100 of principal was outstanding under the Second
Senior Note. Accrued interest of $168,847 and $87,048 is reflected on the balance sheet as accrued interest payable, related party
as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively, 

Note 7   Other Note Payable  

On December 31, 2014,
the Company converted accounts payable into a Senior Promissory Note (the  Note ) in the aggregate principal amount
of $242,498. The Note bears interest at 6% per annum and interest is payable on a quarterly basis commencing March 31, 2015 or
the Company may elect that the amount of such interest be added to the principal sum outstanding under this Note. The payables
arose in connection with professional services rendered by attorneys for the Company prior to and through December 31, 2014, and
the Note had an original maturity date of December 31, 2015, which was extended to June 30, 2016 or such later date as the lender
may agree to in writing. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Quarterly Report ), the Note has
not been extended and is currently in default. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, $269,135 and $262,040 of principal,
which includes $26,637 and $19,542 of accrued interest, respectively, were outstanding under the Note. 

Note 8   Unsecured Convertible Notes
Payable  

Unsecured Convertible notes payable at September 30,
2016 and March 31, 2016 were as follows: 

(A) On January 19, 2016,
the Company issued three 8% unsecured notes payable to investors (the  Lenders ) for an aggregate amount of $200,000.
These notes will be due on January 19, 2018. If the Company raises a minimum of $2,500,000 (excluding the amount converting
pursuant to the notes) in the aggregate in gross proceeds from an equity financing led by a reputable institutional investor
in one or more closings prior to the maturity date, the Lenders will have the rights to convert all outstanding principal
and interest into the same equity securities issued in such qualified equity financing at 75% of the issuance price of the securities
in such financing. In addition, the Lenders received 400,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at
an exercise price of $0.005 per share. The aggregate relative fair value of the 400,000 warrants issued to the Lender was determined
to be $99,915 using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model with the following average assumptions: risk-free interest rate
of 1.30%; dividend yield of 0%; volatility rate of 100%; and an expected life of four years (statutory term). The value of the
warrants of $99,915 was considered as debt discount upon issuance and was being amortized as interest over the term of the notes
or in full upon the conversion of the corresponding notes. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company amortized $9,818 of
such discount to interest expense, and the unamortized discount as of March 31, 2016 was $89,727. During six months ended September
30, 2016, debt discount was fully amortized to interest expense. 

On June 6, 2016, the Lenders
converted $200,000 of principal and $5,918 of interest into 205,918 shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion
price of $1 per share. As the market price of the shares on the date of conversion approximated $1.25 per share, the Company recognized
a beneficial conversion cost of $51,480. 

In addition, the Lenders
were issued 205,920 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.005 per share as
inducement for this conversion. The aggregate fair value of the 205,920 warrants issued to the Lenders was $256,411 using the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model with the following average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.20%; dividend yield of 0%; volatility
rate of 100%; and an expected life of three years (statutory term). The value of the warrants of $256,411 was considered as additional
interest expense upon their issuance. The warrants were exercised immediately into 205,920 shares of the Company s common
stock with net proceeds of $1,030 to the Company. 

(B) On August 19, 2016,
the Company issued a 6% unsecured note payable to a certain investor for total principal amount of $55,000. This note will be due
on September 30, 2018. If the Company raises a minimum of $5,000,000 (excluding the amount converting pursuant to the
note) in the aggregate in gross proceeds from an equity financing led by a reputable institutional investor in one
or more closings prior to the maturity date, the investor will have the rights to convert all outstanding principal
and interest into the same equity securities issued in such qualified equity financing at 75% of the issuance price of the securities
in such financing. In addition, the investor received 55,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at
an exercise price of $0.005 per share. The aggregate relative fair value of the 55,000 warrants issued to the investor was determined
to be $30,503 using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model with the following average assumptions: risk-free interest rate
of 0.88%; dividend yield of 0%; volatility rate of 100%; and an expected life of three years (statutory term). The value of the
warrants of $30,503 was considered as debt discount upon issuance and was being amortized as interest over the term of the notes
or in full upon the conversion of the corresponding notes. During six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company amortized $1,755
of such discount to interest expense, and the unamortized discount as of September 30, 2016 was $28,748. 

(C) On September 14, 2016, the Company issued
a 6% unsecured note payable to a certain investor for total principal amount of $150,000. This note will be due on September 13,
2018. If the Company raises a minimum of $5,000,000 (excluding the amount converting pursuant to the note) in the aggregate
in gross proceeds from an equity financing led by a reputable institutional investor in one or more closings prior
to the maturity date, the investor will have the rights to convert all outstanding principal and interest into the
same equity securities issued in such qualified equity financing at 75% of the issuance price of the securities in such financing.
In addition, the investor received 150,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price
of $0.005 per share. The aggregate relative fair value of the 150,000 warrants issued to the investor was determined to be $83,189
using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model with the following average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 0.88%; dividend
yield of 0%; volatility rate of 100%; and an expected life of three years (statutory term). The value of the warrants of $83,189
was considered as debt discount upon issuance and was being amortized as interest over the term of the notes or in full upon the
conversion of the corresponding notes. During six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company amortized $1,823 of such discount
to interest expense, and the unamortized discount as of September 30, 2016 was $81,366.  

Note 9   Related Party Transactions  

Management Services from Trinad Management
LLC   

Pursuant to a Management
Agreement (the  Management Agreement ) with Trinad Management LLC ( Trinad LLC ) entered into on September
23, 2011, Trinad LLC agreed to provide certain management services to the Company through September 22, 2014, including, without
limitation, the sourcing, structuring and negotiation of potential business acquisitions and customer contracts for the Company.  Under
the Management Agreement, the Company compensated Trinad LLC for its services by (i) paying a fee equal to $2,080,000, with $90,000
payable in advance of each consecutive 3-month calendar period during the term of the Management Agreement and with $1,000,000
due at the end of the 3-year term, and (ii) issuing a warrant to purchase 2,250,000 shares of the Company s common stock
at an exercise price of $0.075 per share (the  Warrant ). The Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part by Trinad
LLC at any time for a period of 10 years. On August 25, 2016, these warrants were exercised on a cashless basis at an exercise
price of $0.075 per share, resulting in the issuance 2,115,000 shares of the Company s common stock. 

During the year ended
March 31, 2015, the Company accrued $180,000 related to the remaining portion due under the Management Agreement. The total amount
of $1,000,000 due to Trinad LLC is reflected as a liability on the accompanying September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 balance sheets.
Trinad LLC continues to provide services to the Company at a fee of $30,000 per month on a month-to-month basis. For the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $180,000 of such costs. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had prepaid
$90,000 of such fees which have been reflected as a prepaid asset, related party on the accompanying September 30, 2016 balance
sheet. 

As of September 30, 2016
and March 31, 2016, amounts due to related parties were $301,745 and $117,124, respectively, payable to Mr. Ellin, our Executive
Chairman, President, director and majority stockholder. These amounts were provided for working capital as needed and are unsecured,
non-interest bearing advances with no formal terms of repayment. 

Rent   

During the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we subleased office space from Trinad LLC for no cost to us. Management
estimates such amounts to be immaterial. We anticipate continuing to sublease such space at no cost to us for the foreseeable future.
We believe that such property is in good condition and is suitable for the conduct of our business. 

Note 10   Commitments and Contingencies  

Promotional
Rights    

The Company acquires
promotional rights from time to time that may contain obligations for future payments.  During the period ended September
30, 2016, the Company incurred $350,000 in payment obligations for the acquisition of certain promotional rights.  As of September
30, 2016, the Company may be liable for additional future payments from these promotions based upon a percentage of net revenue
collected. 

Legal Proceedings   

On
May 20, 2016, Mr. Oliver Bengough filed a Petition for Relief (the  Petition ) in the High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division (the  Court ) against OCHL, OCL, KOKO UK and Mr. Ellin (collectively, the  Respondents ). In connection
with the Petition, effective as of May 20, 2016, Mint Group terminated the Management Services Agreement with OCL pursuant to which
Mint Group served as a contracted service provider to KOKO, a nightclub and live music venue  KOKO  in Camden, London
owned by KOKO UK. Mr. Bengough claimed certain breaches of duty by Mr. Ellin in connection with the corporate operations of the
Respondents, as well as a  deterioration  of the relationship between the parties. Mr. Bengough further claimed that
his interests have been unfairly prejudiced by the conduct of the Respondents and the breakdown of trust and confidence between
himself and Mr. Ellin. In connection with such termination, the Company demanded the resignation of Mr. Bengough (a significant
stockholder of Mint Group) from the board of OCHL due to what the Company strongly believed to be performance and management concerns
on behalf of Mint Group and its non-payment of certain funds. OCHL was formed by OCL s stockholders for the sole purpose
of acquiring all of the registered and contributed capital of OCL, is a 50%-owned subsidiary of the Company and is the parent of
OCL. 

Among
other things, Mr. Bengough was seeking an order by the Court for the sale by KOKO UK of its shares in OCHL to the Petitioner at
a fair market value to be determined by the Court or an independent third party valuation with a discount to reflect the losses
claimed to be suffered by Mr. Bengough. Mr. Bengough was further seeking, if required, an order terminating Mr. Ellin s directorship
of OCHL and OCL, permission to bring a derivative action against Mr. Ellin alleging breaches of certain duties set forth in the
Petition, for the Court to set aside the Senior Note and Junior Note (as each defined below) or alternatively such part of those
notes which the Petitioner alleges are expenses for which Respondents OCL and OCHL should not be liable and for the Court to declare
that OCL and OCHL have no liability for such expenses to us, JJAT or any other person connected with Mr. Ellin. As part of the
initial hearing, the Court granted Mr. Bengough s request for interim relief to allow Mr. Bengough to continue running OCL s
business as it was conducted prior to the filing of the Petition, subject to Mr. Ellin s approval of any expenditures exceeding
$15,000 in amount (the  Interim Injunction ). This interim relief was granted pending a final decision on the Interim
Injunction. 

As
part of the Merger consummated on April 28, 2014, OCHL and OCL became additional promisors under two promissory notes, a promissory
note, dated as of April 28, 2014 (the  Senior Note ), issued in favor of JJAT, and a promissory note, dated as of April
28, 2014 (the  Junior Note ), issued in our favor. Pursuant to the Senior Note, OCHL and OCL are jointly liable to
the Company for the principal amount of $1,376,124 and interest at 8% per annum. Pursuant to the Junior Note, OCHL and OCL are
jointly liable to the Company for a principal amount of $494,749 and interest at 8% per annum. In the event the Court denies Mr.
Bengough s relief summarized above, a request was made by the Petitioner for an order by the Court for the  winding
up  of OCL and OCHL based upon deadlock of its board and members. 

The
Respondents retained UK counsel in this matter and categorically deny all allegations in the Petition and intend to aggressively
defend this action, to refute the allegations set forth therein and to file a substantive counter-complaint in answer to the Petition. 

Subsequently, in connection
with the Interim Injunction, the Petitioner and the Respondents entered into a Consent Order, as approved by the Court on July
22, 2016 (the  Consent Order ), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Mr. Ellin resigned as a director of OCHL
and OCL and Mr. Griston was appointed as a new independent non-executive director on the boards of directors of the two companies,
and (ii) the parties agreed to certain terms allowing them to either settle the disputes or proceed with a sale of the business
to either party. 

On
September 22, 2016, Mr. Bengough entered into a Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with the Respondents
and Global Loan Agency Services Limited, as escrow agent (the  Escrow Agent ), relating to the Petition. Pursuant to
the Settlement Agreement, at the Closing (as defined below) the parties agreed, among other things, to (i) the terms of settlement
in relation to all facts, matters and allegations raised by the Petition against the Respondents, including disputed liability
under the Junior Note, (ii) sell 48,878 ordinary shares and the 2,750 deferred ordinary shares in OCHL owned by KoKo UK to Mr.
Bengough on the terms provided in the Settlement Agreement, (iii) resolve certain ancillary matters arising from the past business
dealings between Messrs. Ellin and Bengough, and (iv) to consummate the transactions contemplated thereunder and under certain
related transaction documents (as defined below) (collectively, the  Settlement Transactions ). 

As
part of the Settlement Transactions, Messrs. Ellin and Bengough entered into an engagement agreement with BTG
Financial Consulting LLP BTG ( BTG ) pursuant to which BTG will carry out an independent expert valuation of the
value of the ordinary shares in OCHL on the terms set forth in the draft engagement letter appearing as an annex to the
Settlement Agreement (the  Valuation ). Upon the conclusion of the Valuation, among other things, (i) Mr.
Bengough shall pay to the Company 50% of the value of the ordinary and deferred ordinary shares in OCHL less  37,000
(the  Purchase Price ) and as a result, acquire the Company s 50% interest in OCHL, (ii) the Settlement
Transactions shall be consummated, (iii) the Company shall discharge the Junior Note, without any further payment by Mr.
Bengough or any other entity to Mr. Ellin, KoKo UK or the Company, and (iv) each party agreed, on behalf of itself and on
behalf of its Related Parties (as defined in the Settlement Agreement) not to sue, commence, voluntarily aid in any way,
prosecute or cause to be commenced or prosecuted against the other party or its Related Parties in any action, suit or other
proceedings concerning the Released Claims (as defined in the Settlement Agreement), in UK or any other jurisdiction.
Successful completion of the transactions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) is collectively defined as the
 Closing . 

To
secure the payment of the Purchase Price, Mr. Bengough (a) executed a Deed of Charge over his shares in OCHL in favor of KoKo UK,
and (b) deposited with the Escrow Agent (collectively, the  Escrowed Items ) (i) the sum of  1,272,265 and (ii)
certificates representing 48,878 ordinary shares and the 2,750 deferred ordinary shares in OCHL held by Mr. Bengough and certain
related documents. In the event that Mr. Bengough does not make the full payment of the Purchase Price to KoKo UK and/or Mr. Ellin
within the time provided in the Settlement Agreement (as discussed more fully below), the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrowed
Items to KoKo UK, Mr. Ellin and/or the Company. 

No
later than the seventh business day after the date on which BTG provides its final Valuation report to Messrs. Ellin and Bengough
and the Escrow Agent (the  Payment Cut-Off Date ), Mr. Bengough shall ensure that KoKo UK is in receipt of cleared
funds for the full amount of the Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price is less than  1,272,265, an amount equal to the Purchase
Price will be paid to KoKo UK by the Escrow Agent out of the funds deposited with the Escrow Agent, subject to and in accordance
with the terms of the escrow agreement entered into by the parties (the  Escrow Agreement ). If the Purchase Price
is equal to or more than  1,272,265, the full amount of  1,272,265 will be paid by the Escrow Agent to KoKo UK and
Mr. Bengough shall, by the Payment Cut-Off Date, pay an amount equal to the difference between the Purchase Price and  1,272,265
to the Escrow Agent s account, with such sum then to be paid by the Escrow Agent to an account specified by Mr. Ellin, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   

Note 11   Equity Incentive Plan  

On August 29, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved the Company s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ),
which reserves a total of 22,800,000 shares of the Company s common stock for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Incentive awards
authorized under the 2016 Plan include, but are not limited to, incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If an incentive award granted under the 2016 Plan expires, terminates, is unexercised
or is forfeited, or if any shares are surrendered to us in connection with the exercise of an incentive award, the shares subject
to such award and the surrendered shares will become available for further awards under the 2016 Plan.

Sale of Common Stock
or Equity Units   

During the six months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to
which the Company sold an aggregate of 500,000 units at a purchase price of $2.50 per share for $1,250,000 in cash proceeds. Each
unit consisted of one share of the Company s common stock and one warrant to purchase a share of the Company s common
stock, exercisable for a period of three years from the date of original issuance at an exercise price of $0.005 per share. 

Issuance of Common
Stock for Services   

During the six months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 543,040 shares of its common stock valued at $450,800 to various consultants. The
Company valued these shares at prices from $0.50 to $1.25 per share, the most recent price of the sale of its common stock near
the date of grant. 

Warrants   

On June 2, 2016, the Company
issued warrants to acquire 205,920 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $256,411 as an inducement to convert a
convertible note. These warrants, along with 400,000 warrants issued to the note holder upon issuance of the note, were exercised
during the period at an exercise price of $0.005 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $3,030. 

In April, 2016, the Company
issued warrants to Trinad Capital, a related party, to acquire 3,352,754 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $1,661,114
at an exercise price of $0.005 to extend the maturity dates of certain notes. These warrants were exercised during the period at
an exercise price of $0.005 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $16,764. 

On August 19, 2016, the
Company issued warrants along with convertible note, to acquire 55,000 shares of Company s common stock valued at $30,503
at an exercise price of $0.005. 

On September 14, 2016,
the Company issued warrants along with a convertible note to acquire 150,000 shares of Company s common stock valued at $83,189
at an exercise price of $0.005. 

The table below summarizes
the Company s warrant activities: 

Increase
of Authorized Common Stock and Creation of Preferred Stock  

On
August 29, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved for the Company to file a Certificate of Amendment
to its Articles of Incorporation (the  Certificate ) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, which increased
the Company s authorized capital stock. The Certificate was filed and became effective on September 1, 2016. The Certificate
increased the aggregate number of shares of capital stock which the Company has the authority to issue to 501,000,000 shares, consisting
of 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of the Company s preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share (the
 preferred stock ). 

The
Company may issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series, each of which will have such distinctive designation
or title as shall be determined by the Company s Board of Directors and will have such voting powers, full or limited, or
no voting powers, and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such class or series of
preferred stock as may be adopted from time to time by the Company s Board of Directors. The Company s Board of
Directors will have the power to increase or decrease the number of shares of preferred stock of any series after the issuance
of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares
of any series shall be decreased, the shares constituting such decrease will resume the status of authorized but unissued shares
of preferred stock. 

While
the Company does not currently have any plans for the issuance of preferred stock, the issuance of such preferred stock could adversely
affect the rights of the holders of common stock and, therefore, reduce the value of the common stock.  It is not possible
to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock on the rights of holders of the common stock until
and unless the Company s Board of Directors determines the specific rights of the holders of the preferred stock  however,
these effects may include: restricting dividends on the common stock, diluting the voting power of the common stock, impairing
the liquidation rights of the common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action
by the stockholders. 

Note 13   Subsequent Events  

Subsequent to the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, Trinad Capital advanced to the Company an additional $25,000 under the terms and conditions of the Second
Senior Note. 

Subsequent to
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, JJAT advanced to the Company an additional $200,000 under the terms and conditions similar
to those of the existing $55,000 note entered into during the period ended September 30, 2016.

General and Business Operations Overview  

We are a holding company
primarily engaged in the emerging live and digital music space, including live music events, through LiveXLive, Corp. ( LXL ),
our operating subsidiary. LXL intends to be the world s first premium live music streaming network that will deliver around
the clock live music to viewers on any connected device as an authentic and experiential platform. The platform plans to offer
the world s leading music festivals with multiday and multistage coverage, unique concerts, intimate performances and cutting
edge programming. We plan to extend the live experience to fans on desktop, laptop, mobile, tablets, consoles, connected TVs and
virtual reality platforms. The LiveXLive network expects to provide compelling and curated content that showcases the entire spectrum
of music to include music inspired fashion, food, and lifestyle content and showcase interviews, backstage access and both fan
and artist perspectives. We intend to feature all genres of music including rock, pop, indie, alternative, EDM, country and feature
major festival headliners as well as emerging artists performing at clubs and venues around the globe. LXL s website is  www.livexlive.com . 

LXL s mission is
to aggregate thousands of hours of live music and content driven by live music through mutually beneficially relationships with
the world s top talent, music companies, festivals and promoters. LXL plans to showcase professionally produced, innovative,
immersive and experiential live broadcasts in HD. Fans will have the opportunity to see their favorite festivals, concerts and

view concert experiences from any connected device with exclusive access only LXL brings from the stage to backstage, inside dressing
rooms, and places previously off limits to anyone but VIPs and artists. We will need additional capital to drive this process and
address present working capital expenditures. 

In addition, on April
28, 2014, we consummated the Merger. As a result of the Merger and our resulting 50% ownership in OCHL and indirect, 50%-owned
investment ownership of OCL, prior to the sale of OCHL (as described below), we indirectly engaged in the operations of KOKO. KOKO
provides live shows, club nights, corporate and other events at KOKO and broadcasted digitally. The venue has been used to record
live performances which have been broadcast to an international audience. 

On September 22, 2016, we entered into a Settlement
Agreement with Mr. Bengough and other parties pursuant to which, at closing, among other things and subject to certain conditions,
we agreed to sell our 50% ownership in OCHL. For more information on the Settlement Agreement and its terms, please see below Item
1. Legal Proceedings under PART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 

Results of Operations  

As of September 30,
2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $17,396,290. We anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses in the next
12 months. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We will
require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other
things, the sale of our equity and/or debt securities. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
as Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues  
 We had $225,000 in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and no revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2015,
from the operations of LXL. The revenues  consisted entirely of a license fee paid to us for the production of a live video
event. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses    Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of outside services, advertising,
public relations and travel and entertainment expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $299,193 to $1,442,657, as compared to $1,741,850 in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which reflects
a decrease in operating costs incurred by us during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Management Services
  Related Parties    Management services   related party costs consisted of management fees paid and accrued
by us under agreements with Trinad Management. For each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we incurred
management fees to Trinad Management of $90,000. 

Other (Income) Expense
   Other (income) expense increased by $409,923 to $438,492 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to other
expense of $28,569 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Other expense primarily represents interest expense incurred in connection
with our 50% investment interest in OCHL. In addition, for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a (loss)
of $(19,515) and earnings of $5,876, respectively, as our share of earnings of OCHL. The increase in other expenses for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 was due to a substantial increase in operating costs of KOKO. 

Net
Income (Loss)      Net (loss) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $132,996 to $(1,727,424), as
compared to $(1,860,420) in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which primarily reflects a decrease in our selling, general and
administrative expenses offset by an increase   interest expense incurred in connection with
our 50% interest in OCHL  

Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 as
Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues  
 We had $225,000 in revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2016, and no revenues for the six months ended September
30, 2015, from the operations of LXL. The revenues consisted entirely of a license fee paid to us for the production of a live
video event. 

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses    Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of outside services, advertising,
public relations and travel and entertainment expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by $100 to $2,527,543, as compared to $2,527,643 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, which reflects
approximately the same amount in operating costs incurred by us during the six months ended September 30, 2016. 

Management
Services   Related Parties    Management services   related party costs consisted of management fees paid
and accrued by us under agreements with Trinad Management. For each of the six-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, we incurred management fees to Trinad Management of $180,000. 

Other (Income) Expense
   Other (income) expense increased by $1,129,923 to $1,067,576 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to other (income) of $(62,347) for the six months ended September 30, 2015. Other expense primarily represents interest expense
incurred in connection with our 50% investment interest in OCHL. For the six-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded earnings of $63,669 and $79,912, respectively, as our share of earnings of OCHL. The decrease for the six-month period
ended September 30, 2016 over the same period in 2015 was due to an increase in operating costs of KOKO. 

Net Income (Loss) 
    Net (loss) for the six months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $886,098 to $(3,531,394), as compared to $(2,645,296)
in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which primarily reflects an increase of interest expense incurred in connection with our
50% interest in OCHL offset by a decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016,
we had total assets of $5,347,087, comprised primarily of cash of $7,869, prepayments to related party of $90,000, prepayments
to third party of $13,152 and net property and equipment of $69,551. Our principal asset, our investment in OCHL, was valued by
us at $4,953,184 as of September 30, 2016. This compares with total assets of $5,218,308 as of March 31, 2016, comprised primarily
of cash of $36,898, prepayments to related party of $15,995 and net property and equipment of $62,569. Our principal asset, our
50% investment interest in OCHL, was valued at $4,889,515 as of March 31, 2016. 

We had current liabilities
of $4,558,742 comprised of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $590,865, short-term notes of $269,135 amounts due to related
parties of $301,745, accrued interest due to related parties of $339,990, note payables due to related party of $2,057,007, and
management service obligation to related party of $1,000,000, as of September 30, 2016. This compares with current liabilities
of $4,877,311, comprised of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $481,412, short-term notes of $262,042 amounts due to related
parties of $117,124, accrued interest due to related parties of $232,733, note payables due to related parties of $2,784,000, and
management service obligation to related party of $1,000,000, as of March 31, 2016. 

On June 8, 2016 and June
10, 2016, we sold certain of our securities to an accredited investor for total gross proceeds of $1,250,000. The securities consisted
of (i) 500,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share, and (ii) a 3-year warrant to purchase 250,000
shares of our common stock exercisable at $0.005 per share. The net proceeds of the sale of these securities will be used for general
working capital. 

Subsequent to the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, (i) Trinad Capital advanced to us an additional $25,000 under the terms and conditions of the
Second Senior Note and (ii) JJAT advanced to us an additional $200,000 under the terms and conditions similar to those of the existing
$55,000 note entered into during the period ended September 30, 2016. 

We depend upon debt and/or
equity financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute its business plan. If continued funding and capital resources are
unavailable at reasonable terms we may curtail our plan of operations. We will be required to obtain alternative or additional
financing from financial institutions or otherwise, in order to maintain and expand our existing operations. The failure by us
to obtain such financing would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Going Concern   

Our consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, and which contemplates continuity of operations,
realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the consolidated financial
statements, we had a working capital deficit of $4,447,721 at September 30, 2016, and incurred a net loss of $3,550,119 and used
net cash of $1,997,841 in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit
report to our financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should we be unable to continue as a going concern 

Our management estimates
that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through December 31, 2016 Our ability to continue as a
going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our business strategy and in our ability to raise additional funds. Management
is currently seeking additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate our
business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that
are satisfactory to us. Even if we can obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is
material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Critical accounting policies
are defined as those most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require the
most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates that we make include
assumption as a going concern, fair value of long-lived assets, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and estimates and assumptions
used in valuation of equity instruments. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable or other assumptions that
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. We have identified the policies described in Note 2   Significant
Accounting Policies and Practices to our consolidated financial statements as our critical accounting policies. However, actual
results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Investment in
Unconsolidated Subsidiary Under the Equity Method   

We account for investments in which we own
more than 20% of the investee, using the equity method in accordance with ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint
Ventures. Under the equity method, an investor initially records an investment in the stock of an investee at cost, and adjusts
the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investor s share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the
date of acquisition. The amount of the adjustment is included in the determination of net income by the investor, and such amount
reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated statements including adjustments to eliminate intercompany
gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between investor cost and underlying equity in net assets of
the investee at the date of investment. The investment of an investor is also adjusted to reflect the investor s share of
changes in the investee s capital. Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. A series
of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred which
is other than temporary and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value is in excess of what would otherwise be
recognized by application of the equity method. 

Carrying Value, Recoverability and Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

An impairment loss will
be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The
carrying amount of a long-lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected
to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (asset group). That assessment is based on the carrying amount of
the asset (asset group) at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the
carrying amount of a long-lived asset (asset group) exceeds its fair value. If an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying
amount of a long-lived asset will be its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated
(amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Restoring a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited. 

Our long-lived asset (asset
group) is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
We test our long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of
such events. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

We periodically issue
stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs.
We account for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by
FASB where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis over the vesting period. We account for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance
with the authoritative guidance of the FASB where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined
at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn
the equity instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount
to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment
is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting. In certain
circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and
the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. 

The fair value of our
stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions
related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends.
Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, and based on
actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense
recorded in future periods

Not required for smaller reporting
companies. 

Item 4.   
       Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our Chief Executive Officer
and Interim Principal Financial Officer performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer concluded
that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. We had neither the resources, nor the
personnel, to provide an adequate control environment. 

Due to our limited resources,
the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting continued to exist at September 30, 2016: 

(i)      We
do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2016 and 2017. Our management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal
controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency
that resulted represented a material weakness. 

(ii)      We
do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the
extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by
separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure
controls and procedures, and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

(iii)      Lack
of independent audit committee of our Board of Directors. 

(iv)      Insufficient
monitoring and review controls over the financial reporting closing process, including the lack of individuals with current knowledge
of GAAP that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements. We have outsourced an interim Principal Financial
Officer to assist us in implementing the necessary financial controls over the financial reporting and the utilization of internal
management and staff to effectuate these controls. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
and Procedures  

Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our control systems are designed
to provide such reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override
of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may
occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

An evaluation was performed
under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer, of whether
any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer, concluded that there were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.   
       Legal Proceedings.    

From time to time, we
may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
business. 

On
May 20, 2016, Mr. Oliver Bengough filed a Petition for Relief (the  Petition ) in the High Court of Justice, Chancery
Division (the  Court ) against OCHL, OCL, KOKO UK and Mr. Ellin (collectively, the  Respondents ). In connection
with the Petition, effective as of May 20, 2016, Mint Group terminated the Management Services Agreement with OCL pursuant to which
Mint Group served as a contracted service provider to KOKO, a nightclub and live music venue  KOKO  in Camden, London
owned by KOKO UK. Mr. Bengough claimed certain breaches of duty by Mr. Ellin in connection with the corporate operations of the
Respondents, as well as a  deterioration  of the relationship between the parties. Mr. Bengough further claimed that
his interests have been unfairly prejudiced by the conduct of the Respondents and the breakdown of trust and confidence between
himself and Mr. Ellin. In connection with such termination, we demanded the resignation of Mr. Bengough (a significant stockholder
of Mint Group) from the board of OCHL due to what we strongly believed to be performance and management concerns on behalf of Mint
Group and its non-payment of certain funds. OCHL was formed by OCL s stockholders for the sole purpose of acquiring all of
the registered and contributed capital of OCL, is a 50%-owned subsidiary of our Company and is the parent of OCL. 

Among
other things, Mr. Bengough was seeking an order by the Court for the sale by KOKO UK of its shares in OCHL to the Petitioner at
a fair market value to be determined by the Court or an independent third party valuation with a discount to reflect the losses
claimed to be suffered by Mr. Bengough. Mr. Bengough was further seeking, if required, an order terminating Mr. Ellin s directorship
of OCHL and OCL, permission to bring a derivative action against Mr. Ellin alleging breaches of certain duties set forth in the
Petition, for the Court to set aside the Senior Note and Junior Note (as each defined below) or alternatively such part of those
notes which the Petitioner alleges are expenses for which Respondents OCL and OCHL should not be liable and for the Court to declare
that OCL and OCHL have no liability for such expenses to us, JJAT or any other person connected with Mr. Ellin. As part of the
initial hearing, the Court granted Mr. Bengough s request for interim relief to allow Mr. Bengough to continue running OCL s
business as it was conducted prior to the filing of the Petition, subject to Mr. Ellin s approval of any expenditures exceeding
$15,000 in amount (the  Interim Injunction ). This interim relief was granted pending a final decision on the Interim
Injunction. 

As
part of the Merger consummated on April 28, 2014, OCHL and OCL became additional promisors under 2 promissory notes, a promissory
note, dated as of April 28, 2014 (the  Senior Note ), issued in favor of JJAT, and a promissory note, dated as of April
28, 2014 (the  Junior Note ), issued in our favor. Pursuant to the Senior Note, OCHL and OCL are jointly liable to
us for the principal amount of $1,376,124 and interest at 8% per annum. Pursuant to the Junior Note, OCHL and OCL are jointly liable
to us for a principal amount of $494,749 and interest at 8% per annum. In the event the Court denies Mr. Bengough s relief
summarized above, a request was made by the Petitioner for an order by the Court for the  winding up  of OCL and OCHL
based upon deadlock of its board and members. 

The
Respondents retained UK counsel in this matter and categorically deny all allegations in the Petition and intend to aggressively
defend this action, to refute the allegations set forth therein and to file a substantive counter-complaint in answer to the Petition. 

Subsequently, in connection
with the Interim Injunction, the Petitioner and the Respondents entered into a Consent Order, as approved by the Court on July
22, 2016 (the  Consent Order ), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Mr. Ellin resigned as a director of OCHL
and OCL and Mr. Griston was appointed as a new independent non-executive director on the boards of directors of the 2 companies,
and (ii) the parties agreed to certain terms allowing them to either settle the disputes or proceed with a sale of the business
to either party. 

On
September 22, 2016, Mr. Bengough entered into a Settlement Agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with the Respondents
and Global Loan Agency Services Limited, as escrow agent (the  Escrow Agent ), relating to the Petition. Pursuant to
the Settlement Agreement, at the Closing (as defined below) the parties agreed, among other things, to (i) the terms of settlement
in relation to all facts, matters and allegations raised by the Petition against the Respondents, including disputed liability
under the Junior Note, (ii) sell 48,878 ordinary shares and the 2,750 deferred ordinary shares in OCHL owned by KoKo UK to Mr.
Bengough on the terms provided in the Settlement Agreement, (iii) resolve certain ancillary matters arising from the past business
dealings between Messrs. Ellin and Bengough, and (iv) to consummate the transactions contemplated thereunder and under certain
related transaction documents (as defined below) (collectively, the  Settlement Transactions ). 

As
part of the Settlement Transactions, Messrs. Ellin and Bengough entered into an engagement agreement with BTG
Financial Consulting LLP BTG ( BTG ) pursuant to which BTG will carry out an independent expert valuation of the
value of the ordinary shares in OCHL on the terms set forth in the draft engagement letter appearing as an annex to the
Settlement Agreement (the  Valuation ). Upon the conclusion of the Valuation, among other things, (i) Mr.
Bengough shall pay to us 50% of the value of the ordinary and deferred ordinary shares in OCHL less  37,000 (the
 Purchase Price ) and as a result, acquire 50% interest in OCHL, (ii) the Settlement Transactions shall be
consummated, (iii) we shall discharge the Junior Note, without any further payment by Mr. Bengough or any other entity to Mr.
Ellin, KoKo UK or us, and (iv) each party agreed, on behalf of itself and on behalf of its Related Parties (as defined in the
Settlement Agreement) not to sue, commence, voluntarily aid in any way, prosecute or cause to be commenced or prosecuted
against the other party or its Related Parties in any action, suit or other proceedings concerning the Released Claims (as
defined in the Settlement Agreement), in UK or any other jurisdiction. Successful completion of the transactions referred to
in clauses (i) through (iv) is collectively defined as the  Closing . 

To
secure the payment of the Purchase Price, Mr. Bengough (a) executed a Deed of Charge over his shares in OCHL in favor of KoKo UK,
and (b) deposited with the Escrow Agent (collectively, the  Escrowed Items ) (i) the sum of  1,272,265 and (ii)
certificates representing 48,878 ordinary shares and the 2,750 deferred ordinary shares in OCHL held by Mr. Bengough and certain
related documents. In the event that Mr. Bengough does not make the full payment of the Purchase Price to KoKo UK and/or Mr. Ellin
within the time provided in the Settlement Agreement (as discussed more fully below), the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrowed
Items to KoKo UK, Mr. Ellin and/or us per our instructions. 

No
later than the seventh business day after the date on which BTG provides its final Valuation report to Messrs. Ellin and Bengough
and the Escrow Agent (the  Payment Cut-Off Date ), Mr. Bengough shall ensure that KoKo UK is in receipt of cleared
funds for the full amount of the Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price is less than  1,272,265, an amount equal to the Purchase
Price will be paid to KoKo UK by the Escrow Agent out of the funds deposited with the Escrow Agent, subject to and in accordance
with the terms of the escrow agreement entered into by the parties (the  Escrow Agreement ). If the Purchase Price
is equal to or more than  1,272,265, the full amount of  1,272,265 will be paid by the Escrow Agent to KoKo UK and
Mr. Bengough shall, by the Payment Cut-Off Date, pay an amount equal to the difference between the Purchase Price and  1,272,265
to the Escrow Agent s account, with such sum then to be paid by the Escrow Agent to an account specified by Mr. Ellin, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Company may elect that the amount of such interest be added to the principal sum outstanding under this Note. The payables arose
in connection with professional services rendered by attorneys for the Company prior to and through December 31, 2014, and the
Note had an original maturity date of December 31, 2015, which was extended to June 30, 2016 or such later date as the lender may
agree to in writing. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Note has not
been extended and is currently in default. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, $269,135 and $262,040 of principal, which

Aggregate Number of Shares . Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, the maximum aggregate number of

Shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock.

Awards . If an Award expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, or, with respect to Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units, is forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, the unpurchased
 (or for Awards other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the forfeited or repurchased Shares) which were subject
thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Upon exercise of a Stock
Appreciation Right settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares covered by the portion of the Award so settled will cease to be

by the Company to pay the tax and/or exercise price of an Award will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan.
To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the
number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan and, for the elimination of doubt, the number of Shares of equal value to
such cash payment shall become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3(b), subject to adjustment provided in Section 14 hereof, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the
exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in Section 3(a) above, plus, to the extent
allowable under Section 422 of the Code, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this Section 3(b). 

(c)            Share
Reserve . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as will
be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

(a)   Procedure .

may be established with respect to different groups of Service Providers; in that event, the Committee established with respect
to a group of Service Providers shall administer the Plan with respect to Awards granted to members of such group. 

(ii)   Section 162(m) . To the extent that the
Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Awards granted hereunder as  performance-based compensation

defined therein, the Plan will be administered by a Committee of two (2) or more  outside directors  within the meaning
of Section 162(m) of the Code.

above, the Plan will be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which committee will be constituted to satisfy
Applicable Laws. 

(b)           Powers
of the Administrator . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties

(iii)  to determine the terms and condition, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award

would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may determine consistent

Rule . Nonstatutory Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units, Performance
Shares, and such other cash or stock awards as the Administrator determines may be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock
Options may be granted only to Employees. 

6.   Stock Options . 

(a)     Limitations . 

(i)  Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a
Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the
Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar
year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000 (U.S.), such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory
Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which
they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares
is granted.   

(ii)  Subject to the limits set forth in Section 3, the Administrator will have complete discretion to
determine the number of Shares subject to an Option granted to any Participant.   

(b)   Term
of Option . The Administrator will determine the term of each Option in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the term
will be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof in the case of Incentive Stock Options Moreover, in the case
of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of
the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. 

(c)    Option
Exercise Price and Consideration . 

(i)   Exercise Price . The per share exercise price
for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, but will be no less than
100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. In addition, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to
an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power
of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of
the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(c), Options may
be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant
to the issuance or assumption of an Option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies in a manner consistent
with said Section 424(a). 

(ii)   Waiting Period and Exercise Dates . At the time
an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions
that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. 

(iii)   Form of Consideration . The Administrator will
determine the acceptable form(s) of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Laws.

(i)   Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder .
Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions
as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. 

An Option will be deemed exercised
when the Company receives: (i) notice of exercise (in such form as the Administrator specifies from time to time) from the
person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised
(together with any applicable withholding taxes). No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record
date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 14 hereof. 

(ii)   Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider .
If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant s termination as the result of the Participant s
death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement
to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such
Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain
exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant s termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator,
if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested
portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within
the time specified by Award Agreement or by operation of this Section 6(d)(3), the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered
by such Option will revert to the Plan. 

(iii)   Disability of Participant . If a Participant
ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option
within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of cessation
(but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of
a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for six (6) months following the date the Participant
ceases to be a Service Provider. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of cessation the Participant is
not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan. If
after cessation the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate,
and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan. 

(iv)   Death of Participant . If a Participant dies
while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the
extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of
the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant s beneficiary, provided such beneficiary
has been designated prior to Participant s death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been
designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant s estate
or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant s will or in accordance with the laws
of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for
six (6) months following Participant s death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant
is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will continue to vest in
accordance with the Award Agreement. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate,
and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.

Restricted Stock Units . Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will be entitled to receive a payout
as specified in the Award Agreement. 

(d)    Form
and Timing of Payment . Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) set forth
in the Award Agreement, which shall satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable to such Award.
The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares, or a combination thereof. Shares
represented by Restricted Stock Units that are fully paid in cash again will be available for grant under the Plan. 

(e)     Cancellation .
On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company. 

(f)     Section
162(m) Performance Restrictions . For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock Units as  performance-based compensation 
under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of
Performance Goals. The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date. In granting Restricted
Stock Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will follow any procedures determined
by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code
(e.g., in determining the Performance Goals). 

10.   Performance Units and Performance Shares . 

(a)     Grant
of Performance Units/Shares . Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from
time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. The Administrator will have complete discretion
in determining the number of Performance Units/Shares granted to each Participant. 

(b)     Value
of Performance Units/Shares . Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or
before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date
of grant. 

(c)     Performance
Objectives and Other Terms . The Administrator will set performance objectives or other vesting provisions. The Administrator
may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited
to, continued employment), or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion. Each Award of Performance Units/Shares
will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator,
in its sole discretion, will determine. 

(d)     Earning
of Performance Units/Shares . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will
be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period,
to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have
been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any
performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share. 

(e)     Form
and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares . Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon as practicable
after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period or, if earlier, after the date on which a Participant s interest
in such Performance Units/Shares is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, provided however, that in no event shall
such payment be made after the later to occur of (i) December 31 of the year in which such risk of forfeiture lapses or (ii) two
and one-half months after such risk of forfeiture lapses. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance
Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance
Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof. 

(f)      Cancellation
of Performance Units/Shares . On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares
will be forfeited to the Company, and again will be available for grant under the Plan. 

(g)     Section
162(m) Performance Restrictions . For purposes of qualifying grants of Performance Units/Shares as  performance-based
compensation  under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon
the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals will be set by the Administrator on or before the Determination Date.
In granting Performance Units/Shares which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator will
follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under
Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals). 

11.   Performance-Based Compensation Under Code Section 162(m) . 

(a)    General .
If the Administrator, in its discretion, decides to grant an Award intended to qualify as  performance-based compensation 
under Code Section 162(m), the provisions of this Section 11 will control over any contrary provision in the Plan; provided, however,
that the Administrator may in its discretion grant Awards that are not intended to qualify as  performance-based compensation 
under Section 162(m) of the Code to such Participants that are based on Performance Goals or other specific criteria or goals but
that do not satisfy the requirements of this Section 11. 

(b)    Performance
Goals . The granting and/or vesting of Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance
Units and other incentives under the Plan may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business
criteria within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and may provide for a targeted level or levels of achievement (   Performance
Goals   ) including (i) earnings per Share, (ii) operating cash flow, (iii) operating income, (iv) profit
after-tax, (v) profit before-tax, (vi) return on assets, (vii) return on equity, (viii) return on sales, (ix) revenue,
and (x) total shareholder return. Any Performance Goals may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or
a business unit of the Company and may be measured relative to a peer group or index. The Performance Goals may differ from Participant
to Participant and from Award to Award. Prior to the Determination Date, the Administrator will determine whether any significant
element(s) will be included in or excluded from the calculation of any Performance Goal with respect to any Participant. 

(c)    Procedures .
To the extent necessary to comply with the performance-based compensation provisions of Code Section 162(m), with respect to any
Award granted subject to Performance Goals, within the first twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period, but in no event
more than ninety (90) days following the commencement of any Performance Period (or such other time as may be required or permitted
by Code Section 162(m)), the Administrator will, in writing, (i) designate one or more Participants to whom an Award will be made,
(ii) select the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Period, (iii) establish the amounts of such Awards, as applicable,
which may be earned for such Performance Period, and (iv) specify the relationship between Performance Goals and the amounts
of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Participant for such Performance Period. Following the completion of each Performance
Period but in no event later than December 31 of the year in which such Performance Period ends or, if later, the date that is
two and one-half months after the end of such Performance Period, the Administrator will certify in writing whether the applicable
Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period and pay any amount to which a Participant is entitled under an
Award with respect to such Performance Period. In determining the amounts earned by a Participant, the Administrator will have
the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase) the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account
additional factors that the Administrator may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance for the Performance
Period. A Participant will be eligible to receive payment pursuant to an Award for a Performance Period only if the Performance
Goals for such period are achieved. 

(d)    Additional
Limitations . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award which is granted to a Participant and is intended to
constitute qualified performance based compensation under Code Section 162(m) will be subject to any additional limitations set
forth in the Code (including any amendment to Section 162(m)) or any regulations and ruling issued thereunder that are requirements
for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) of the Code, and the Plan will be
deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. 

12.      Leaves of Absence .
Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence.
A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company, or (ii) transfers
between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options,
no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract.
If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months and one
day following the commencement of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an
Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. 

13.      Transferability of
Awards . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred,
or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime
of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award may only be transferred
(i) by will, (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution, (iii) to a revocable trust, or (iv) as permitted by Rule 701 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

14.      Adjustments; Dissolution
or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control . 

(a)    Adjustments .
In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property),
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase,
or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the
Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended
to be made available under the Plan, will adjust the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the
number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 3,
6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 hereof. 

(b)    Dissolution
or Liquidation . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each
Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously
exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 

(c)    Change
in Control . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines,
including, without limitation, that each Award will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation
or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation (the   Successor Corporation  ). The Administrator will
not be required to treat all Awards similarly in the transaction. 

In the event that
the Successor Corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to
exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not
otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Restricted Stock Units,
Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels
and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for
in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option
or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator in its sole
discretion, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 

For the purposes of
this subsection (c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase
or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash,
or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines
to settle in cash or a Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to settle in cash, the fair
market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on
the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen
by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in
Control is not solely common stock of the Successor Corporation, the Administrator may, with the consent of the Successor Corporation,
provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a
Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Performance Units, the number of
implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration received by holders of
Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the Successor Corporation equal in fair market value to the
per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. 

Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 14(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance
Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant s
consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the Successor Corporation s post-Change
in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption. 

(a)    Withholding
Requirements . Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have
the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy
federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant s FICA obligation) required to be withheld with
respect to such Award (or exercise thereof). 

(b)    Withholding
Arrangements . The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time,
may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (i) paying cash,
(ii) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum
amount required to be withheld, (iii) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount
required to be withheld, or (iv) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such
means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required
to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may
be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state or local
marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld
is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the
taxes are required to be withheld. 

16.      No Effect on
Employment or Service . Neither the Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing
the Participant s relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the
Participant s right or the Company s right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. 

17.      Date of Grant . The
date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such
Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant
within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. 

18.      Term of Plan . Subject
to Section 22 hereof, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board (the   Effective Date  ).
It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 19 hereof; provided, however,
that such expiration shall not affect Awards then outstanding, and the terms and conditions of this Plan shall continue to apply
to such Awards. 

19.      Amendment and Termination
of the Plan . 

(a)     Amendment
and Termination . The Administrator may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan. 

(b)    Stockholder
Approval . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of the Plan and any Plan amendment to the extent necessary or desirable
to comply with Applicable Laws. 

(c)     Effect
of Amendment or Termination . No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any
Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing
and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator s ability to exercise
the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination. 

20.      Conditions Upon Issuance
of Shares . 

(a)    Legal
Compliance . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance
and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company
with respect to such compliance. 

(b)     Investment
Representations . As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent
and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention
to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required. 

(c)     Restrictive
Legends . All Award Agreements and all securities of the Company issued pursuant thereto shall bear such legends regarding restrictions
on transfer and such other legends as the appropriate officer of the Company shall determine to be necessary or advisable to comply
with applicable securities and other laws. 

21.      Inability to Obtain Authority .
The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the
Company s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any
liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained. 

22.      Stockholder Approval .
The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted
by the Board. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws, including
without limitation Section 422 of the Code. In the event that stockholder approval is not obtained within twelve (12) months after
the date the Plan is adopted by the Board, all Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall be void  ab initio  and of
no effect. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no Awards shall be exercisable until the date of such stockholder
approval. 

23.      Notification of Election
Under Section 83(b) of the Code . If any Service Provider shall, in connection with the acquisition of Shares under the Plan,
make the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code, such Service Provider shall notify the Company of such election within
ten (10) days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service and provide the Company with a copy thereof, in
addition to any filing and a notification required pursuant to regulations issued under the authority of Section 83(b) of the Code.
A Service Provider shall not be permitted to make a Section 83(b) election with respect to an Award of a Restricted Stock Unit. 

24.      Notification Upon Disqualifying
Disposition Under Section 421(b) of the Code . Each Service Provider shall notify the Company of any disposition of Shares issued
pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating
to certain disqualifying dispositions), within ten (10) days of such disposition. 

25.      409A Timing Rule for
Specified Employees . If at the time of a Service Provider s separation from service, such individual is considered a
 specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, and if any payment that such Service
Provider becomes entitled to under the Plan or any Award is deemed payable on account of such individual s separation from
service, then no such payment shall be made prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after the individual s
separation from service, or (ii) the individual s death. 

26.      Governing Law . The
law of the State of Nevada shall govern all questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation of this Plan, without
regard to such state s conflict of laws rules, subject to the Company s intention that the Plan satisfy the requirements
of jurisdictions outside of the United States of America with respect to Awards subject to such jurisdictions.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT   

LOTON, CORP.  

THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement )
is entered into as of the ___ day of ______________, 201__ (the  Date of Grant ) 

BETWEEN:   LOTON, CORP. , a company incorporated pursuant to
the laws of the State of Nevada (the  Company ), 

AND:   [_______________],  of ________________________________
(the  Optionee ). 

WHEREAS:  

A.           The
Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) has approved and adopted the Loton, Corp. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan
(the  2016 Plan ), pursuant to which the Board is authorized to grant to employees and other selected service providers
and persons, including members of the Board, stock options to purchase common shares of the Company (the  Common Stock ); 

B.           The
2016 Plan provides for the granting of stock options that either (i) are intended to qualify as  Incentive Stock Options 
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), or (ii) do not satisfy
the requirements for qualification under Section 422 of the Code ( Nonstatutory Stock Options ); and 

C.           The
Board has authorized the grant to Optionee of options to purchase a total of  [_______________] ([____])  shares of Common
Stock (the  Options ), which Options are intended to be (select one): 

Incentive Stock Options; 

x   Nonstatutory Stock Options 

NOW THEREFORE, the Company agrees to offer
to the Optionee the option to purchase, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, [__________]  ( [____] ) 
shares of Common Stock. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the 2016 Plan. 

1.              Exercise
Price.  The exercise price of the options shall be  US$ [_____] per share. 

2.              Limitation
on the Number of Shares.  If the Options granted hereby are Incentive Stock Options, the number of shares which may be acquired
upon exercise thereof is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(a) of the 2016 Plan. 

3.              Vesting
Schedule.  The Options shall vest in accordance with  Exhibit A  attached hereto. 

4.              Options
not Transferable.  Subject to Section 13 of the 2016 Plan, the Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred,
or disposed of in any manner (whether by operation of law or otherwise) other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution
or, in the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and shall not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process;  provided, however  , that if the Options represent a Nonstatutory Stock Option, such Option
is transferable without payment of consideration to immediate family members of the Optionee or to trusts or partnerships established
exclusively for the benefit of the Optionee and Optionee s immediate family members. Upon any attempt to transfer, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any Option or of any right or privilege conferred by the 2016 Plan contrary to the provisions
thereof, or upon the sale, levy or attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred by the 2016 Plan, such
Option shall thereupon terminate and become null and void. 

5.              Investment
Intent.  By accepting the Options, the Optionee represents and agrees that none of the shares of Common Stock purchased upon
exercise of the Options will be distributed in violation of applicable federal and state laws and regulations. In addition, the
Company may require, as a condition of exercising the Options, that the Optionee execute an undertaking, in such a form as the
Company shall reasonably specify, that the Stock is being purchased only for investment and without any then-present intention
to sell or distribute such shares. 

6.              Termination
of Employment and Options.  Vested Options shall terminate, to the extent not previously exercised, upon the occurrence of the
first of the following events: 

(a)   Expiration.  [__________] ([____]) years from the Date of Grant.   

(b)   Termination for Cause.  The date of the first discovery by the Company of any reason for
the termination of an Optionee s employment or contractual relationship with the Company or any related company for cause
(as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator (as defined in the 2016 Plan)), and, if an Optionee s employment
is suspended pending any investigation by the Company as to whether the Optionee s employment should be terminated for cause,
the Optionee s rights under this Agreement and the 2016 Plan shall likewise be suspended during the period of any such investigation.   

(c)   Termination Due to Death or Disability.  Subject to Section 6(d)(iii) of the 2016 Plan, the
expiration of six (6) months from the date of the death of the Optionee or cessation of an Optionee s employment or contractual
relationship by reason of Disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e) of the Code) (but in no event later than the expiration
of the term of such Option as set forth in this Agreement). Subject to Section 6(d)(iv) of the 2016 Plan, if an Optionee s
employment or contractual relationship is terminated by death, any Option held by the Optionee shall be exercisable only by the
person or persons to whom such Optionee s rights under such Option shall pass by the Optionee s will or by the laws
of descent and distribution.   

(d)   Termination For Any Other Reason.  If the Optionee s employment or contractual relationship
terminates for reasons other than those described in the preceding Sections 6(b) or 6(c), then the Option shall terminate, to the
extent not previously exercised, in accordance with Section 6(a).   

Each unvested Option granted pursuant hereto
shall terminate immediately upon termination of the Optionee s employment or contractual relationship with the Company for
any reason whatsoever, including Disability unless vesting is accelerated in accordance with the 2016 Plan. 

7.            Stock. 
In the case of any stock split, stock dividend or like change in the nature of shares of Stock covered by this Agreement, the number
of shares and exercise price shall be proportionately adjusted as set forth in Section 14(a) of the 2016 Plan. 

8.            Exercise
of Option.  Options shall be exercisable, in full or in part, at any time after vesting, until termination;  provided, however, 
that any Optionee who is subject to the reporting and liability provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, with respect to the Common Stock shall be precluded from selling or transferring any Common Stock or other security
underlying an Option during the six (6) months immediately following the grant of that Option. If less than all of the shares included
in the vested portion of any Option are purchased, the remainder may be purchased at any subsequent time prior to the expiration
of the Option term. Only whole shares may be issued pursuant to an Option, and to the extent that an Option covers less than one
(1) share, it is unexercisable. 

Each exercise of the Option shall be by
means of delivery of a notice of election to exercise (which may be in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit B)  to the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company at its principal executive office, specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased
and accompanied by payment in cash by certified check or cashier s check in the amount of the full exercise price for the
Common Stock to be purchased. In addition to payment in cash by certified check or cashier s check, an Optionee or transferee
of an Option may pay for all or any portion of the aggregate exercise price by complying with one or more of the following alternatives: 

(a)  by delivering to the Company shares of Common Stock
previously held by such person, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, or by the Company withholding shares of Common Stock
otherwise deliverable pursuant to exercise of the Option, which shares of Common Stock received or withheld shall have a fair
market value at the date of exercise (as determined by the Administrator) equal to the aggregate purchase price to be paid by
the Optionee upon such exercise; or 

(b)  by complying with any other payment mechanism approved
by the Administrator at the time of exercise. 

It is a condition precedent to the issuance
of shares of Common Stock that the Optionee execute and/or deliver to the Company all documents and withholding taxes required
in accordance with Section 15 of the 2016 Plan. 

9.            Holding
period for Incentive Stock Options.  In order to obtain the tax treatment provided for Incentive Stock Options by Section 422
of the Code, the shares of Common Stock received upon exercising any Incentive Stock Options received pursuant to this Agreement
must be sold, if at all, after a date which is later of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement is entered into or one (1)
year from the date upon which the Options are exercised. The Optionee agrees to report sales of shares prior to the above determined
date to the Company within one (1) business day after such sale is concluded. The Optionee also agrees to pay to the Company, within
five (5) business days after such sale is concluded, the amount necessary for the Company to satisfy its withholding requirement
required by the Code. Nothing in this Section 9 is intended as a representation that Common Stock may be sold without registration
under state and federal securities laws or an exemption therefrom or that such registration or exemption will be available at any
specified time. 

10.          Resale
restrictions may apply.  Any resale of the shares of Common Stock received upon exercising any Options will be subject to resale
restrictions contained in the securities legislation applicable to the Optionee. The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the
Optionee is solely responsible (and the Company is not in any way responsible) for compliance with applicable resale restrictions. 

11.          Subject
to 2016 Plan.  The terms of the Options are subject to the provisions of the 2016 Plan, as the same may from time to time be
amended, and any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the 2016 Plan, as the same may be from time to time amended, shall
be governed by the provisions of the 2016 Plan, a copy of which has been delivered to the Optionee, and which is available for
inspection at the principal offices of the Company. 

12.          Professional
Advice.  The acceptance of the Options and the sale of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of Options may have consequences
under federal and state tax and securities laws which may vary depending upon the individual circumstances of the Optionee. Accordingly,
the Optionee acknowledges that he or she has been advised to consult his or her personal legal and tax advisor in connection with
this Agreement and his or her dealings with respect to Options. Without limiting other matters to be considered with the assistance
of the Optionee s professional advisors, the Optionee should consider: (a) whether upon the exercise of Options, the Optionee
will file an election with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code and the implications of alternative
minimum tax pursuant to the Code; (b) the merits and risks of an investment in the underlying shares of Common Stock; and (c) any
resale restrictions that might apply under applicable securities laws. 

13.          No
Employment Commitment.  The grant of the Options shall in no way constitute any form of agreement or understanding binding on
the Company or any Related Company, express or implied, that the Company or any Related Company will employ or contract with the
Optionee, for any length of time, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Company s or, where applicable, a Related Company s
right to terminate Optionee s employment at any time, which right is hereby reserved. 

14.          Entire
Agreement.  This Agreement is the only agreement between the Optionee and the Company with respect to the Options, and this
Agreement and the 2016 Plan supersede all prior and contemporaneous oral and written statements and representations and contain
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Options.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT   

LOTON, CORP.  

THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement )
is entered into as of the ___ day of ______________, 201__ (the  Date of Grant ) 

BETWEEN:   LOTON, CORP. , a company incorporated pursuant to
the laws of the State of Nevada (the  Company ), 

AND:  [ _______________],  of ________________________________
(the  Optionee ). 

WHEREAS:  

A.          The
Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) has approved and adopted the Loton, Corp. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan
(the  2016 Plan ), pursuant to which the Board is authorized to grant to employees and other selected service providers
and persons, including members of the Board, stock options to purchase common shares of the Company (the  Common Stock ); 

B.          The
2016 Plan provides for the granting of stock options that either (i) are intended to qualify as  Incentive Stock Options 
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), or (ii) do not satisfy
the requirements for qualification under Section 422 of the Code ( Nonstatutory Stock Options ); and 

C.           The
Board has authorized the grant to Optionee of options to purchase a total of  [_______________] ([____])  shares of Common
Stock (the  Options ), which Options are intended to be (select one): 

Incentive Stock Options;   

Nonstatutory Stock Options   

NOW THEREFORE, the Company agrees to offer
to the Optionee the option to purchase, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, [__________]  ( [____] ) 
shares of Common Stock. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the 2016 Plan. 

1.             Exercise
Price.  The exercise price of the options shall be US $ [_____] per share. 

2.             Limitation
on the Number of Shares.  If the Options granted hereby are Incentive Stock Options, the number of shares which may be acquired
upon exercise thereof is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(a) of the 2016 Plan. 

3.             Vesting Schedule. 
The Options shall vest in accordance with  Exhibit A  attached hereto, provided however that, in the event that an Optionee
is party to a written employment agreement with the Company pursuant to which service-based vesting requirements applicable to
Options are excused, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (a  Change in Control Vesting Accelerator ),
then Exhibit A shall be deemed to incorporate by reference such provisions. 

4.             Options not Transferable. 
Subject to Section 13 of the 2016 Plan, the Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed
of in any manner (whether by operation of law or otherwise) other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or, in
the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and shall not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process;  provided, however  , that if the Options represent a Nonstatutory Stock Option, such Option
is transferable without payment of consideration to immediate family members of the Optionee or to trusts or partnerships established
exclusively for the benefit of the Optionee and Optionee s immediate family members. Upon any attempt to transfer, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any Option or of any right or privilege conferred by the 2016 Plan contrary to the provisions
thereof, or upon the sale, levy or attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred by the 2016 Plan, such
Option shall thereupon terminate and become null and void. 

5.             Investment Intent. 
By accepting the Options, the Optionee represents and agrees that none of the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of
the Options will be distributed in violation of applicable federal and state laws and regulations. In addition, the Company may
require, as a condition of exercising the Options, that the Optionee execute an undertaking, in such a form as the Company shall
reasonably specify, that the Stock is being purchased only for investment and without any then-present intention to sell or distribute
such shares. 

6.            Termination of
Employment and Options.  Vested Options shall terminate, to the extent not previously exercised, upon the occurrence of the
first of the following events: 

(a)   Expiration.  [__________] ([____]) years from the Date of Grant.   

(b)   Termination for Cause.  The date of the first discovery by the Company of any reason for
the termination of an Optionee s employment or contractual relationship with the Company or any related company for cause
(as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator (as defined in the 2016 Plan)), and, if an Optionee s employment
is suspended pending any investigation by the Company as to whether the Optionee s employment should be terminated for cause,
the Optionee s rights under this Agreement and the 2016 Plan shall likewise be suspended during the period of any such investigation.   

(c)   Termination Due to Death or Disability.  Subject to Section 6(d)(iii) of the 2016 Plan, the
expiration of six (6) months from the date of the death of the Optionee or cessation of an Optionee s employment or contractual
relationship by reason of Disability (within the meaning of Section 22(e) of the Code) (but in no event later than the expiration
of the term of such Option as set forth in this Agreement). Subject to Section 6(d)(iv) of the 2016 Plan, if an Optionee s
employment or contractual relationship is terminated by death, any Option held by the Optionee shall be exercisable only by the
person or persons to whom such Optionee s rights under such Option shall pass by the Optionee s will or by the laws
of descent and distribution.   

(d)   Termination On or After a Change in Control.  If the Optionee s employment or contractual
relationship terminates for reasons other than those described in the preceding Sections 6(b) or 6(c) on or after the occurrence
of a Change of Control due to an involuntary termination within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(n) (including,
without limitation, termination by the Optionee for  good reason  within the meaning of Section 1.409a-1(n)(2)), then
the Option shall terminate, to the extent not previously exercised, in accordance with Section 6(a).   

(e)   Termination for Any Other Reason.  Subject to Section 6(d) of the 2016 Plan, the expiration
of three (3) months from the date of an Optionee s termination of employment or contractual relationship with the Company
or any affiliated company or subsidiary of the Company (a  Related Corporation ) for any reason whatsoever other than
termination of service for cause, death, Disability, or on or after a Change in Control.   

Each unvested Option granted pursuant hereto
shall terminate immediately upon termination of the Optionee s employment or contractual relationship with the Company for
any reason whatsoever, including Disability unless vesting is accelerated in accordance with the 2016 Plan. 

7.              Stock. 
In the case of any stock split, stock dividend or like change in the nature of shares of Stock covered by this Agreement, the number
of shares and exercise price shall be proportionately adjusted as set forth in Section 14(a) of the 2016 Plan. 

8.              Exercise
of Option.  Options shall be exercisable, in full or in part, at any time after vesting, until termination;  provided, however, 
that any Optionee who is subject to the reporting and liability provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, with respect to the Common Stock shall be precluded from selling or transferring any Common Stock or other security
underlying an Option during the six (6) months immediately following the grant of that Option. If less than all of the shares included
in the vested portion of any Option are purchased, the remainder may be purchased at any subsequent time prior to the expiration
of the Option term. Only whole shares may be issued pursuant to an Option, and to the extent that an Option covers less than one
(1) share, it is unexercisable. 

Each exercise of the Option shall be by
means of delivery of a notice of election to exercise (which may be in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit B)  to the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company at its principal executive office, specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased
and accompanied by payment in cash by certified check or cashier s check in the amount of the full exercise price for the
Common Stock to be purchased. In addition to payment in cash by certified check or cashier s check, an Optionee or transferee
of an Option may pay for all or any portion of the aggregate exercise price by complying with one or more of the following alternatives: 

(a)  by delivering to the Company shares of Common Stock previously held by such person, duly endorsed
for transfer to the Company, or by the Company withholding shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable pursuant to exercise of
the Option, which shares of Common Stock received or withheld shall have a fair market value at the date of exercise (as determined
by the Administrator) equal to the aggregate purchase price to be paid by the Optionee upon such exercise; or   

(b)  by complying with any other payment mechanism approved by the Administrator at the time of exercise.   

It is a condition precedent to the issuance
of shares of Common Stock that the Optionee execute and/or deliver to the Company all documents and withholding taxes required
in accordance with Section 15 of the 2016 Plan. 

9.              Holding
period for Incentive Stock Options.  In order to obtain the tax treatment provided for Incentive Stock Options by Section 422
of the Code, the shares of Common Stock received upon exercising any Incentive Stock Options received pursuant to this Agreement
must be sold, if at all, after a date which is later of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement is entered into or one (1)
year from the date upon which the Options are exercised. The Optionee agrees to report sales of shares prior to the above determined
date to the Company within one (1) business day after such sale is concluded. The Optionee also agrees to pay to the Company, within
five (5) business days after such sale is concluded, the amount necessary for the Company to satisfy its withholding requirement
required by the Code. Nothing in this Section 9 is intended as a representation that Common Stock may be sold without registration
under state and federal securities laws or an exemption therefrom or that such registration or exemption will be available at any
specified time. 

10.          Resale
restrictions may apply.  Any resale of the shares of Common Stock received upon exercising any Options will be subject to resale
restrictions contained in the securities legislation applicable to the Optionee. The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the
Optionee is solely responsible (and the Company is not in any way responsible) for compliance with applicable resale restrictions. 

11.          Subject
to 2016 Plan.  The terms of the Options are subject to the provisions of the 2016 Plan, as the same may from time to time be
amended, and any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the 2016 Plan, as the same may be from time to time amended, shall
be governed by the provisions of the 2016 Plan, a copy of which has been delivered to the Optionee, and which is available for
inspection at the principal offices of the Company. 

12.          Professional
Advice.  The acceptance of the Options and the sale of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of Options may have consequences
under federal and state tax and securities laws which may vary depending upon the individual circumstances of the Optionee. Accordingly,
the Optionee acknowledges that he or she has been advised to consult his or her personal legal and tax advisor in connection with
this Agreement and his or her dealings with respect to Options. Without limiting other matters to be considered with the assistance
of the Optionee s professional advisors, the Optionee should consider: (a) whether upon the exercise of Options, the Optionee
will file an election with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code and the implications of alternative
minimum tax pursuant to the Code; (b) the merits and risks of an investment in the underlying shares of Common Stock; and (c) any
resale restrictions that might apply under applicable securities laws. 

13.          No
Employment Commitment.  The grant of the Options shall in no way constitute any form of agreement or understanding binding on
the Company or any Related Company, express or implied, that the Company or any Related Company will employ or contract with the
Optionee, for any length of time, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Company s or, where applicable, a Related Company s
right to terminate Optionee s employment at any time, which right is hereby reserved. 

14.          Entire
Agreement.  This Agreement is the only agreement between the Optionee and the Company with respect to the Options, and this
Agreement and the 2016 Plan supersede all prior and contemporaneous oral and written statements and representations and contain
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Options.
