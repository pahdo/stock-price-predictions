Note 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Description of Business    
VIASPACE Inc. ( we ,  us ,  VIASPACE , or the  Company ) was founded in July 1998.
Its business involves renewable energy and is based on biomass, in particular our license to a dedicated energy crop with the trademark
 Giant King    Grass  ( GKG ). Through a sublicense for GKG we obtained from VIASPACE Green
Energy Inc. ( VGE ), we are able to commercialize GKG throughout the world, except for the People s Republic
of China ( China ) and the Republic of China ( Taiwan ). 

GKG can be burned in 100% biomass power
plants to generate electricity; made into pellets that can be burned together with coal to reduce carbon emissions from existing
power plants; generate bio methane through anaerobic digestion, and can be used as a feedstock for low carbon liquid biofuels for
transportation, biochemicals and bio plastics. Cellulosic ethanol, bio butanol and other liquid cellulosic biofuels, do not use
corn or other food sources as feedstock. GKG can also be used as animal feed. GKG and other plants absorb and store carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere as they grow. When they are burned, they release the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is the
same carbon dioxide that was removed from the atmosphere, and so this process is carbon neutral. Small amounts of fossil fuel are
used by the farm equipment, transportation of GKG and fertilizer, so that the overall process of growing and burning GKG probably
has some net carbon dioxide emissions, but much lower emissions than burning coal or other fossil fuels directly to create the
same amount of energy. GKG has been independently tested by customers and been shown to have excellent energy content, high bio
methane production, and the cellulosic sugar content needed for biofuels and biochemicals. 

Going Concern     The
Company has incurred significant losses from operations, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $53,266,000. The Company expects
such losses to continue. However, on September 30, 2012, as discussed in Note 4, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with
Dr. Kevin Schewe, a member of the Company s Board of Directors, whereby Dr. Schewe agreed to fund the Company up to $1,000,000
over a five-year period in accordance with such agreement. Schewe completed the funding of $1,000,000 on January 13, 2016. On January
25, 2016, Schewe entered into a new Loan Agreement whereby he agreed to fund the Company an additional $300,000 over a one-year
period. The Company expects loans from Dr. Schewe and revenue generated from future contracts using the sublicense it has for Giant
King Grass to fund operations for the foreseeable future. However, no assurance can be given that Dr. Schewe will continue to fund
the Company or that sales contracts will be obtained in the future, or if they are obtained, that they will be profitable. Accordingly,
there continues to be substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any other adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Basis of Presentation    
The unaudited interim financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 

These statements reflect all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information
contained therein. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K. The
Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports. 

Results of operations for the interim periods
are not indicative of annual results. 

Recent Accounting Standards   
   In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition of revenue. The guidance states that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Our adoption begins with the
first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of this accounting standard update on our results of operations or financial position. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entities Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). The guidance in ASU 2014-15 sets forth management's responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern as well as required disclosures.
ASU 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing financial statements for interim and annual financial statements, management should
evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going
concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This evaluation should include
consideration of conditions and events that are either known or are reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are
issued or are available to be issued, as well as whether it is probable that management's plans to address the substantial doubt
will be implemented and, if so, whether it is probable that the plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective
for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.
The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

Note 2   Investment
in Almaden Energy Group   

The investment in Almaden Energy Group,
LLC ( AEG ) represents an 18.75% interest in that company s outstanding member units which became effective April
15, 2015. The Company originally accounted for this investment by the cost method because the member units of that company is unlisted
and the criteria for using the equity method of accounting are not satisfied as the Company is not able to exercise significant
influence over AEG. However, upon the Company hiring the CEO of AEG as its CEO in July 2015, the Company changed the method of
its investment in AEG to the equity method. Dividends are recognized in income when declared and totaled $0 for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The carrying value of the investment is $19,000 and $40,000 as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We recorded other expense of $21,000 in the Company s Statements
of Operation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to a loss on investment in AEG. See Note 7 for additional
related party transactions with AEG. 

NOTE 3   STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS
AND ISSUED STOCK  

The fair value of each stock option granted
is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model has
assumptions for risk free interest rates, dividends, stock volatility and expected life of an option grant. The risk free interest
rate is based upon market yields for United States Treasury debt securities at a maturity near the term remaining on the option.
Dividend rates are based on the Company s dividend history. The stock volatility factor is based on the historical volatility
of the Company s stock price. The expected life of an option grant is based on management s estimate as no options
have been exercised in the Plan to date. The Company calculated a forfeiture rate for employees and directors based on historical
information. A forfeiture rate of 0% is used for options granted to consultants. The fair value of each option grant to employees,
directors and consultants is calculated by the Black-Scholes method and is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period of each stock option award. 

The following is a summary of the Company s stock option
activity for the nine months ended at September 30, 2016: 

Stock options totaling 56,250,000 were
granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Plan recorded $197,000 of compensation expense for employees and director
stock options in 2016. At September 30, 2016, there was $89,000 of unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested share-based
compensation arrangements under the Plan that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one
year. There were no options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 4     CONVERTIBLE NOTES
PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTY  

Loan Agreement with Dr. Kevin Schewe  

Effective September 30, 2012, the Company
entered into a Loan Agreement with Director Kevin Schewe whereby Dr. Schewe agreed to loan up to $1 million to the Company over
a five-year period based on requests from the Company. The loans would be evidenced by a Secured Convertible Note. Each individual
loan will accrue interest at 6% per annum and are secured by all assets of the Company. Each note would mature on the second anniversary
of the issuance date of such note. Each note is convertible at Dr. Schewe s request, into a fixed number of shares of the
Company s common stock based on the closing price of the Company s common stock for the twenty trading days prior to
the issuance of the loan, less an 80% discount. In connection with the separation from VGE on September 30, 2012, Dr. Schewe was
granted an irrevocable proxy that permits him to vote the Preferred Share, giving him the majority shareholder vote. As the controlling
shareholder of the Company he has the ability to increase the number of authorized shares without additional shareholder approval.
As such, if the outstanding balance on the loan was convertible into more shares than the Company has authorized, he has the ability
to increase the authorized shares. As a result, the conversion feature is not deemed to be a derivative instrument subject to bifurcation.
Schewe completed the funding of $1,000,000 on January 13, 2016 with a funding of $5,000. 

On January 25, 2016, Schewe entered into
a new Loan Agreement whereby he agreed to fund the Company an additional $300,000 over a one-year period. From January 14, 2016
through September 30, 2016, Dr. Schewe made loans of $236,000 to the Company. Including the loan of $5,000 on January 13, 2016,
the Company recorded a discount on the loans of $241,000 as a result of a beneficial conversion feature, which will be amortized
over the term of the note on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method. During 2016, Dr. Schewe converted
loans totaling $241,000 into 442,380,952 common shares of the Company. At the time of the conversions, the company recorded the
discount as additional interest expense. There are $0 loans outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had remaining availability under the note of $64,000. 

NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

Common Stock  

As of January 1, 2016, the number of authorized
shares of the Company s common stock was 3,900,000,000. 

During 2016 and 2015, the Company issued
100,000,000 and 40,000,000 unregistered restricted shares of common stock respectively to a funding source so that the funding
source can pay for future expenses on behalf of the Company. The shares are issued to the funding source to cover the amount of
future expenses plus a fee of 15% of such future expenses. At the time of the future payment of the expenses incurred by the Company,
the common stock and additional paid in capital are credited for the amount of the future payment plus 15%. During the period ending
September 30, 2016 there is no accounting impact from this transaction because the shares remain in the Company's possession. 

On February 24, 2016, the Company entered

As of September 30, 2016, there were 2,529,368,659
shares of common stock outstanding. 

NOTE 6   NET LOSS PER SHARE  

The Company computes net loss per share
in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260. Under its provisions, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted earnings would customarily include,
if dilutive, potential shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of
outstanding stock options and warrants is reflected in earnings per share in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260 by application
of the treasury stock method. For the periods presented, the computation of diluted loss per share equaled basic loss
per share as the inclusion of any dilutive instruments would have had an antidilutive effect on the earnings per share calculation
in the periods presented. 

The following table sets forth common stock
equivalents (potential common stock) at September 30, 2016 and 2015 that are not included in the loss per share calculation since
their effect would be anti-dilutive for the periods indicated: 

The following table sets forth the computation
of basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Included in the Company s balance
sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are Related Party Payables of $664,000 and $656,000, respectively. The Company
has a payable of $648,000, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 owed to Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CTO. Of the amount owed to Dr.
Kukkonen, there is a cash component totaling $144,000 and a common stock component totaling $504,000. Dr. Kukkonen deferred a portion
of his 2009, 2010 and 2011 stock awards and is entitled to the following unregistered shares of Company common stock at December
31, 2015: 11,195,707 shares for deferred 2009 compensation; 8,467,939 shares for deferred 2010 compensation; and 24,730,678 shares

salary and commission earned but not paid. In addition, $15,500 is owed to Haris Basit at September 30, 2016 for salary earned
but not paid. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company also has a royalty payable to VGE of $0 and $16,000, respectively. On March 28, 2016, the Giant King Grass license
with VGE was renegotiated which resulted in the Company not owing VGE any royalties for past revenues recorded by the Company.
The $16,000 was recorded as other income in the Company s Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

The Company has a loan agreement with Director Dr. Kevin Schewe
which is described in Note 4. 

On December 18, 2013, the Company entered
into a Representation in Pakistan and Giant King Grass supply contract with Winergy Pakistan Private Limited ( Winergy ),
a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Pakistan. Mr. Khurram Irshad, a former director of the Company, is a director
and shareholder of Winergy. Mr. Irshad resigned from the Company s board of directors on January 24, 2016. Winergy was also
appointed the exclusive representative of the Company in Pakistan. Winergy is developing bioenergy and animal feed projects in
Pakistan and seeking a biomass source. The Company's Giant King Grass will be supplied to Winergy and a propagation nursery and
test plot is to be established in Pakistan. Winergy will operate and pay the expenses for a Giant King Grass propagation nursery
and test plot in Pakistan. Winergy paid a one-time fee of $5,000 to the Company upon the signing of the contract. The Company expects
to receive additional license fees in the future from Winergy when they are able to secure relationships with customers who will
use the Company's Giant King Grass in their particular application. No revenues were received from Winergy in 2016. 

On April 13, 2015, the Company entered
into a Giant King Grass supply contract with Almaden Energy Group, LLC. ( AEG ). AEG is developing an animal feed project
in the United States for the domestic and global market. The Company granted AEG a license to grow Giant King Grass only for animal
feed, nursery and research purposes anywhere within the 48 contiguous United States. AEG is permitted to sell Giant King Grass
anywhere in the world with the exception of the State of Hawaii. AEG will provide funding to the Company in return for the Company
providing seedlings and technical support and training to establish the initial 25 acres plantation in Imperial County, CA. Twenty-six
acres were leased of which 20 acres were planted in August 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company has
an 18.75% equity ownership in AEG and one designated board seat provided that the Company maintains an equity ownership position
greater than 5%. At September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $19,000 as an Investment in AEG on its Balance Sheet under equity
method of accounting (see Note 2). 

NOTE 8   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company currently has no long term
office lease. The Company leases land in San Diego County, California where it grows Giant King Grass. Rent and utility expense
charged to operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,000 and $13,000, respectively. Rent and utility
expense charged to operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,000 and $10,000, respectively. 

Collaborative Agreements   

We are a party to certain collaborative
agreements with various entities for the joint operation of test plots to establish that GKG grows well in the area and optimal
agronomic practices are developed. These agreements are in the form of development collaborations and licensing agreements. Under
these agreements, we have granted rights to grow and use of GKG. In return, we are entitled to receive certain payments for the
operations of the test plots and license fees on the harvesting of GKG should it ultimately be commercialized. 

All of our collaborative agreements are
subject to termination by either party, without significant financial penalty. Under the terms of these agreements, upon a termination
we are entitled to reacquire all rights in our technology at no cost and are free to re-license the technology to other collaborative
partners. 

Revenue earned from collaborative agreements
is comprised of negotiated payments for the establishment, evaluation and operations of GKG test plots. Deferred revenue represents
customer payments received which are related to future performance. Generally, for collaborative agreements establishing test plots,
the Company recognizes revenue only after the Giant King Grass is planted in the customer s location. Until that time any
money received is recorded as deferred revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company received
$80,000 and $99,000, respectively, in payments under these collaborative agreements. The Company recognized revenue from these
collaborative agreements of $36,000 and $49,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company
recognized revenue from these collaborative agreements of $92,000 and $72,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION  

The following discussion contains certain
statements that constitute    forward-looking statements . Such statements appear in a number of places
in   this Report, including, without limitation,  Management s Discussion and   Analysis of Financial Condition
or Plan of Operation.   These statements are not   guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties
and   requirements that are difficult to predict or are beyond our control.  Our   future results may differ
materially from those currently anticipated depending   on a variety of factors, including those described below under  Risks
Related   to Our Future Operations  and our filings with the Securities and Exchange   Commission. The
following should be read in conjunction with the unaudited   Financial Statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere
in   this Report and in conjunction with our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.  

VIASPACE Overview   

Description of Business    
VIASPACE Inc. ( we ,  us ,  VIASPACE , or the  Company ) was founded in July 1998.
Its business involves renewable energy and is based on biomass, in particular our license to a dedicated energy crop with the trademark
 Giant King    Grass  ( GKG ). Through a sublicense for GKG we obtained from VIASPACE Green
Energy Inc. ( VGE ), we are able to commercialize GKG throughout the world, except for the People s Republic
of China ( China ) and the Republic of China ( Taiwan ). 

GKG can be burned in 100% biomass power
plants to generate electricity; made into pellets that can be burned together with coal to reduce carbon emissions from existing
power plants; generate bio methane through anaerobic digestion, and can be used as a feedstock for low carbon liquid biofuels for
transportation, biochemicals and bio plastics. Cellulosic ethanol, bio butanol and other liquid cellulosic biofuels, do not use
corn or other food sources as feedstock. GKG can also be used as animal feed. GKG and other plants absorb and store carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere as they grow. When they are burned, they release the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is the
same carbon dioxide that was removed from the atmosphere, and so this process is carbon neutral. Small amounts of fossil fuel are
used by the farm equipment, transportation of GKG and fertilizer, so that the overall process of growing and burning GKG probably
has some net carbon dioxide emissions, but much lower emissions than burning coal or other fossil fuels directly to create the
same amount of energy. GKG has been independently tested by customers and been shown to have excellent energy content, high bio
methane production, and the cellulosic sugar content needed for biofuels and biochemicals. 

Critical accounting policies and
estimates   

Financial Reporting Release No. 60,  Cautionary
Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies  ( FRR60 ) issued by the SEC, suggests companies
provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting
policy critical if it is important to the Company s financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant
judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company s significant accounting
policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 

The preparation of the Company s
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies discussed
below require significant management judgments and estimates. 

The Company has four revenue models for
GKG: 1. grass plantation integrated with a power plant or processing facility such as a pellet mill under company or joint venture
control; 2. contract plantation establishment, support and licensing for a customer that owns and operates the plantation and power
plant; 3. collaborative agreements to establish a test plot in the customer s location to determine that GKG grows sufficiently
for the customer to use in their particular application; and 4. consulting agreement services for customers considering the establishment
of a grass plantation in their particular country or location. Revenue earned from collaborative agreements is comprised of negotiated
payments for the operations of the test plots. Deferred revenue represents payments received which are related to future performance.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has recognized revenues under revenue models 3 and 4. 

With regard to revenue recognition in connection
with agreements that include multiple deliverables, management reviews the relevant terms of the agreements and determines whether
such deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements.
If it is determined that the items do not have stand-alone value, then such deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of
accounting and any payments received pursuant to such agreement, including any upfront or development milestone payments and any
payments received for support services, will be deferred and included in deferred revenue within our balance sheet until such time
as management can estimate when all of such deliverables will be delivered, if ever. Management reviews and reevaluates such conclusions
as each item in the arrangement is delivered and circumstances of the development arrangement change. 

The Company accounts for equity instruments
issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 505-50,
 Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling
Goods or Services  and  Accounting Recognition for Certain Transactions Involving Equity Instruments Granted to Other
than Employees . The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of
(i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant
or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument
is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505-50, an asset acquired in exchange
for the issuance of fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments should not be presented or classified as an offset to equity
on the grantor's balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the Company records
the fair value of the fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock issued for future consulting services as prepaid expenses in its
balance sheet. 

The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
There is no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The Company s net loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,019,000. Non-cash expenses totaled $659,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
primarily due to stock options expense, stock compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and loss on minority interest.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $77,000 of cash in 2016. Net cash used by operating activities for operations
was $283,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company has incurred significant
losses from operations, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $53,266,000 at September 30, 2016. The Company expects such
losses to continue. However, on December 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with Director Kevin Schewe
whereby Dr. Schewe agreed to fund the Company up to $1,000,000 over a five-year period. Schewe completed the funding of
$1,000,000 on January 13, 2016. On January 25, 2016, Schewe entered into a new Loan Agreement whereby he agreed to fund the
Company an additional $300,000 over a one-year period.  The Company expects to continue as a going concern, however no
assurance can be given that Dr. Schewe will continue to fund the Company or that sales contracts will be obtained in the
future, or if obtained, that such contracts will be profitable or generate cash for the Company. The Company received
$241,000 from Kevin Schewe related to these Loan Agreements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During 2016, we
received capital of $20,000 through the sales of unregistered shares of common stock to Almaden Energy Group, LLC, a related
party. During 2016, we also received capital of $24,000 from Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CTO of the Company and immediate family
members of Dr. Kukkonen. Other non-related investors also purchased $5,000 of unregistered shares of the Company s
common stock. Without proceeds from additional equity financings, future net revenues or loans from Dr. Schewe, the Company
could not continue as a going concern. As of November 9, 2016, the Company had remaining availability under the note of $0.
Dr. Schewe funded the Company $64,000 from October 1, 2016 through November 9, 2016 which fulfilled and completed his
$300,000 loan agreement entered into on January 25, 2016. The Company expects contracts related to Giant King Grass and
occasional direct purchases of stock from investors to fund the operations of the Company for the foreseeable future.
 Based upon our cash requirements for our plan of operations and our current dividend policy of investing any
available cash back into our operations, we do not plan to distribute any cash to our shareholders.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

This information is not required of smaller
reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

We maintain a system of disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Accounting Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

For the period ended September 30, 2016,
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In the course of this evaluation, our management considered the material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31,
2015. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure. To overcome this weakness, our principal executive and financial officers have reviewed and provided additional substantive
accounting information and data in connection with the preparation of this quarterly report.  Therefore, despite the weaknesses
identified, our principal executive and financial officers believe that there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material
facts necessary to make the statements included in this report not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they are
made.   

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

We will continue to monitor and evaluate
the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financing reporting on an ongoing basis
and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds
allow. 

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or were
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

The Company does not have any material
legal proceedings as of September 30, 2016. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

Risk Factors Which May Affect Future
Results   

The Company cautions that the following
important factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Company s actual results
and could cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
Company. 

There have been no material changes to
the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, other than as set forth
below: 

Risks Related to our Grass Business    

If we fail to comply with our obligations
in our intellectual property licenses, we could lose license rights that are important to our     business.   

Executed on April 4, 2016 and effective
as of March 28, 2016, the Company, VGE and IPA China, entered into the Global Supply, License, and Commercialization Agreement
(the  New Agreement ). 

Prior to the New Agreement, IPA China and
VGE had entered into a certain Supply and Commercialization Agreement dated September 30, 2012 regarding a license and supply arrangement
between IPA China and VGE regarding Giant King Grass ( IPA-VGE Agreement ). In turn, VGE and the Company also entered
into a certain Supply and Commercialization Agreement dated September 30, 2012 regarding a license and supply arrangement between
VGE and the Company regarding Giant King Grass ( VGE-VIASPACE Agreement ). 

Under the New Agreement, VGE and the Company
terminated the VGE-VIASPACE Agreement and IPA directly granted the Company an exclusive, perpetual license to commercialize its
intellectual property rights to three (3) types of high yield, non-genetically modified grasses ( Three GK Grasses )
throughout the world except Cambodia, People s Republic of China, Taiwan, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and
Singapore ( VIASPACE Territory ). It and VGE agreed to subordinate the terms of the IPA-VGE Agreement to the terms
of the New Agreement. IPA China also granted the right to use and market the name  Giant King Grass  and other related
names. 

The Company would owe royalty payments
on the Net Sales of the Three GK Grasses. This license would be sublicenseable in the VIASPACE Territory. IPA China held all rights
of ownership to the Three GK Grasses. The Company would own any grasses resulting from any modifications or improvements to the
Three GK Grasses. IPA China would use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its intellectual property rights. The Company
would use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Three GK Grasses throughout the VIASPACE Territory. 

If the Company does not make its required
royalty payments, it could lose its license. If the Company lost its license, it could be forced to cease its business. 

Risks Related To An Investment
In Our Stock    

We have incurred losses and anticipate
continued losses for the foreseeable future.   

Our net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,019,000 and $2,006,000, respectively. We have not yet achieved profitability
and expect to continue to incur net losses until we recognize increased higher revenues from GKG related sales. Because we do not
have an operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based, our prospects must be considered in light of
the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies seeking to develop new and rapidly evolving technologies.
To address these risks, we must, among other things, respond to competitive factors, continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified
personnel and continue to develop our technologies. We may not be successful in addressing these risks. We can give no assurance
that we will achieve or sustain profitability. 

Any future sale of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock could     depress the trading price of our common stock, lower our value and make
it more     difficult for us to raise capital.   

Any sale of a substantial number of shares
of our common stock (or the prospect of sales) may depress the price of our common stock. In particular, we will need to raise
additional capital to maintain any ongoing business. We anticipate that the issuance of newly-issued shares to maintain our business
will likely be very dilutive. In addition, these sales could lower our value and make it more difficult for us to raise capital.
Further, the timing of the sale of the shares of our common stock may occur at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain
additional equity capital on terms more favorable to us. 

The Company has 3,900,000,000 authorized
shares of common stock, of which 2,639,368,659 were accounted for by our transfer agent as issued and outstanding as of September
30, 2016. Of these issued and outstanding shares, 1,313,987,784 shares (49.8%) are currently held by our executive officers, directors,
and principal shareholders including related parties (including Mr. Haris Basit, CEO; Dr. Carl Kukkonen, CTO and Director; Mr.
Stephen J. Muzi, CFO; Ms. Angelina Galiteva, Director; Dr. Kevin L. Schewe, Director; Mr. Sung Hsien Chang, former director of
the Company; Inter Pacific Arts Corporation, a former subsidiary of the Company; and Almaden Energy Group, LLC, a Company partner
managed by Mr. Haris Basit, CEO of the Company). Of the shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016, 1,431,360,264 are
accounted by our transfer agent as restricted under Rule 144. These shares could be released in the future if requested by the
holder of the shares, subject to volume and manner of sale restrictions under Rule 144. 1,208,008,395 shares of the Company s
common stock are accounted for by our transfer agent as free trading at September 30, 2016. 

We cannot predict the size of future issuances
of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market
price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares currently held by management and
principal shareholders), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common
stock. 

Our executive officers, directors
(including current and former), principal shareholders and related parties own 49.8% of our voting stock, which may allow them
to control substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval, and their interests may not align with the interests of our
other shareholders.   

Our executive officers, directors (including
current and former), principal shareholders and related parties hold 49.8% of our outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016.
In addition, on May 14, 2010, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Designation
of Series A Preferred Stock. The Certificate was approved by the Board and did not require shareholder vote. The Certificate created
a new class of preferred stock known as Series A Preferred Stock. There is one share designated as Series A Preferred Stock. One
share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 50.1% of the outstanding votes on all shareholder voting matters. Series A Preferred
Stock has no dividend rights and no rights upon a liquidation event and is subject to cancellation when certain conditions are
met. 

On May 14, 2010, the Company issued one
share of Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Chang related to the acquisition of IPA by VIASPACE and VGE. This empowers Chang with
supermajority voting rights even after he holds less than a majority of outstanding voting securities. 

Effective as of September 30, 2012, and
pursuant to an Agreement to Grant Voting Rights and Transfer Preferred Share executed by Chang and Director Kevin Schewe, Chang
granted Schewe an irrevocable proxy that permitted Schewe to vote the Preferred Share. This proxy lasts so long as the License
(discussed in Note 8) remained exclusive to the Company. Upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of five years or (ii) the date
when the Company reached a market capitalization of at least $50 million, the proxy would be cancelled as the Preferred Share would
be transferred from Chang to Schewe.
