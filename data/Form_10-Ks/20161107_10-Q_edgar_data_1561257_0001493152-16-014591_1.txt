NOTE
1    ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS   

Helpful
Alliance Company was incorporated in April 2012 in State of Florida. Helpful Alliance Company (the  Company ) is a
real-estate developer with the activities in three areas: construction, business development, and financial assistance. The Company s
construction arm manages the construction, remodeling and sale of residential properties. Its business development arm develops
affordable home kits and its proprietary assembly methods and tools. Its financial activities arm provides residential and commercial
loans in which real estate properties are used as collaterals.  

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, pursuant to Section
107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B) for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. We will therefore delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards
that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We may
take advantage of this extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B) until the first to occur of the
date we (i) are no longer an  emerging growth company  or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended
transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B). As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
that comply with public company effective dates.  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Going
concern   

These
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among
other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,062,643 and $248,281 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an accumulated deficit of $2,064,391 and working capital deficit of $1,180,429
at September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital,
implement its business plan, and generate significant revenues. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Management
is continuing with its plan to expand operations in construction and business development, which requires substantial additional
working capital. The management believes that its current operating strategy, combined with continued funding, will provide the
opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company plans on raising capital through the sale of equity or
debt instruments to implement its business plan. The Company remains dependent upon outside investors or its controlling stockholders
to fund its operations. There is no assurance that the Company will raise the required capital or succeed in the realization of
its business plans.

Principles
of consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Helpful Alliance Company Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Seasons Creek Development LLC, from inception on November 30, 2015 and its wholly-owned subsidiary, River City Park LLC, from
inception on May 3, 2016 and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( US GAAP ). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ( US GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on
management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using
historical experience and other factors, including the economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events
and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include valuation of warrant and allowance for doubtful
accounts.  

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  

In
our opinion, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
necessary to present fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of our operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results
of our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
the full year due to seasonal variations in operating results and other factors. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been
taken from the audited financial statements as of that date. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Fair
value of financial instruments and fair value measurements   

The
Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies
the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify
the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
    1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.   

Level
    2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
    similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs
    derived from or corroborated by observable market data.   

Level
    3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, current notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued
interest payable and due to officer approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Furthermore, non-current notes receivable amounts approximate their fair value since they carry market rates of interest. The
Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September
30, 2016.  

ASC
825-10   Financial Instruments   ,  allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets
and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and
is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and
losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply
the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months
or less. There were no cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Note
interest receivables   

Note
interest receivables are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The Company reviews its accounts to estimate losses resulting
from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Any required allowance is based on specific analysis of past due
accounts and also considers historical trends of write-offs. Past due status is based on how recently payments have been received
from customers. An allowance was deemed necessary for two customers in the amount of $501,120 at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.  

Notes
receivable   

  10
provides general guidance for receivables and notes that receivables arise from credit  

  The
Company follows FASB ASC 310-10 that provides general guidance for receivables and notes that arise from credit sales, loans,
or other transactions. This Subtopic further discusses acquisition, development, and construction arrangements and provides  guidance
for determining whether a lender should account for an acquisition, development, and construction arrangement as a loan or as
an investment in real estate or a joint venture.   

Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requires that companies disclose the fair value of their notes receivable
in the notes to the financial statements if they do not approximate their fair value. Also, GAAP recently changed to allow companies
to choose to carry receivables at fair value in their balance sheets, with changes in fair value recognized as gains or losses
in the income statements. The Company has not opted to carry its notes at fair value, and continues to carry its notes at face
value.

The
Company forecloses on collateral properties for which the notes that are   six
months  in default by the borrower. The notice gives the borrower 10 business days to bring the account
current or repay the loan when maturity is reached. Upon foreclosure on the collateral property, the property will be sold to
pay off the debt.   

When
it becomes probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a note, the
receivable is   considered impaired and the Company
does not record interest income on past due loans.  When a creditor s investment in a note receivable
becomes impaired for any reason, the receivable is re-measured at the discounted present value of currently expected cash flows
at the loan s original effective rate. The difference between the carrying amount of the note and the discounted present
value is the amount of impairment to be recorded.   

Equipment   

Equipment
is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized.
When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed, and any resulting gains or losses are
included in the Statement of Operations.  

Land
held for development   

Land
held for development and costs attributable to the development activities which are held for future development where no significant
development has been undertaken is stated at cost less impairment costs (if any). When land held for development is sold any resulting
gains or losses are included in the Statement of Operations. The Company acquired land held for future development in State of
Virginia in December 2015 at historical cost of $211,336, which represents the purchase price. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 the Company incurred costs attributable to the development activities in amount of $116,811, which were capitalized.  

Patent
costs   

Patents
are stated at cost and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited. Patents
are recorded at the historical cost basis. The Company acquired a patent from an affiliated company in March 2015 valued at the
historical cost basis, or $8,145, which represents the legal fees for filing the patent applications. In December 2015, the Company
purchased a patent application from the Company s founder valued at the historical cost basis, or $200, which represented
the cost of filing fees associated with this patent application. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred
$3,506 in legal fees for patent application acquired in March 2015, and these costs were capitalized. The Company will begin amortizing
these patent costs when the patent applications are approved, and therefore did not recognize any amortization expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Impairment
of long-lived assets   

The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected
undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value.

Investment
in Unconsolidated Investees   

The
Company accounts for investments in which the Company owns less than 20% of the investee, using the cost method under ASC-325-20
requires the Company to account for the investment at its historical cost (i.e., the purchase price) and appears as an asset on
the balance sheet of the Company.  

The
Company makes investments in real estate development entities. The investments have the following criteria, so the Company accounts
for the investment using the cost method:  

The
    Company has no substantial influence over the investee (generally considered to be an investment of 20% or less of the shares
    of the investee).   

The
    investment has no easily determinable fair value.   

Once
the Company records the initial transaction, there is no need to adjust it, unless there is evidence that the fair market value
of the investment has declined to below the recorded historical cost. If so, the Company writes down the recorded cost of the
investment to its new fair market value.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation is included in Compensation expense and totaled $1,233 and
$46 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Pursuant
to ASC 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement
date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total
amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of
the award at the reporting date.  

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company s specific revenue recognition
policies are as follows:  

Interest
Income:  Revenue is earned on the interest bearing notes based on the effective yield of the financial instrument. In the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $20,581 and $130,907 revenues, respectively, generated from interest
income. The Company records income from the settlement and sale of collateral from notes held into revenue when the note or collateral
is sold and the cash proceeds are received. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized
$124,214 of proceeds from the foreclosure and sale of one note.

to the customer. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no revenues generated by the sale of home
kits.  

Engineering
consulting:    Revenues from sales of engineering consulting services are earned when services are provided. In the nine

Segments   

The
Company follows the guidance of ASC 280-10 for  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company only operated in one segment.  

Income
taxes   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements
and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences
reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending upon the classification of the
asset or liabilities to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified
as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10  Uncertainty in Income Taxes  (ASC 740-10). Certain recognition
thresholds must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue
to recognize tax positions that meet a  more-likely-than-not  threshold. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions that would require either recognition or disclosure in the
accompanying financial statements.

Basic
and diluted earnings per share   

Pursuant
to ASC 260-10-45, basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted income per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during each period. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock or other contracts to issue common stock resulting in the issuance
of common stock that would then share in the Company s income (loss) subject to anti-dilution limitations. Potentially dilutive
common shares consist of common stock issuable for stock warrants, convertible debt, Series X - common stock, restricted stock
options (using the treasury stock method). In periods where the Company has a net loss, all potentially dilutive securities are
excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact.  

Net
loss per share for each class of common stock is as follows:  

The
Company s aggregate common stock equivalents at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 included the following:

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize
(i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of,
a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors;
however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We
are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash
flows or financial condition.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions
of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing   .The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the
amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on
(a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s
promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied
at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments
in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement
necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact
on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

Reclassification   

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior year s data to conform to current year representation. These reclassifications
had no effect on the net loss.

Overview   

We
were incorporated in the state of Florida on April 11, 2012. Upon incorporation, our founders, Dr. Temnikov, Mr. Gurin and FVZ,
LLC (represented by Ms. Fay Katz and Mr. Val Zevel), have collectively invested $100,000 in capital, which was used to finance
expenses associated with our organizational expenses and commencement of our engineering activities aimed on the technology research
and product development, including, but not limited to, renting a 4,000 square feet warehouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in
which we built, tested, and demolished our experimental wall structures. As more capital was required for a continuous research
and testing, our initial investors have provided approximately $2.8 million in unsecured debt bearing annual interest varying
between 6% and 8%. In effort to reduce depletion of principal capital resources, we have engaged into the financial assistance
activities by lending money in the commercial loans, most of which were secured by real estate property collaterals, and used
interest income to finance our operating expenses associated with our business start-up, engineering and market research, and
product development stages.  

On September 8, 2016,
our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-205358) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  Registration Statement ). We registered 15,025,658 shares of common stock at an offering price of $2 per share,
of which 14,500,000 are being offered by the Company in connection with its initial public offering and the remaining 525,658
shares are offered by Selling Stockholders named in the Registration Statement. As of the date of this report, no shares have
been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement and there is no public trading market for our securities. 

Our
anticipated products are currently grouped into three principal product lines, each of which is designed to be a natural expansion
of the previously planned product line, and the combination of which is designed to improve the way people build properties and
organize their living in the 21 st  century:  

Wall
    Panels    We intend to offer our proprietary wall panels that we believe will enable concrete contractors to build
    monolithic walls faster and at a lesser cost. The cost advantage is mainly based upon a reduced cost of labor required to
    build a structure as compared with using traditional cinderblock or removable mold forms. Engineers and developmental testing
    indicate that our wall panels are currently applicable to build basement walls, retaining walls, or any other walls (except
    sea walls) up to a height of 24 feet. This line of products features utility that is new to the construction industry, and,
    therefore, is presently unknown to other developers and builders. As of the date of this report, we have not tested any of
    the wall panels in a real construction project. We are currently engaged in product development activities including, but
    not limited to, purchase of suitable land, acquisition of materials and supplies, and construction of an experimental property
    using our wall panels.    

Building
    Kits    We are designing and developing the set of engineering specifications and construction materials that we
    call  Building Kits.  We envision this product line to be a natural expansion of our wall panel product line,
    as we incorporate such wall panels into the Building Kits. At the present time, we are developing the building kits for single-
    and multi-family structures up to 60 feet of height. Our goal is to test the performance of certain building kits in our Seasons
    Creek and other near-term projects and offer first building kits for sale in year 2020.    

Organic
    Communities  ( TM  pending registration)   We are designing new living communities that utilize our proprietary
    Organic Community ( TM  pending registration) concept that we believe will present a new perception of organized
    living for people to work and live in the 21 st  century. We envision this product line to be a natural expansion
    of our planned building kits product line, as we intend on developing the building kits to comprise and build properties in
    our Organic Community  TM  neighborhoods. This product line is focused on Millennials and the Generation-Z generation
    markets. Our goal is to test certain Organic Community  TM  functionality in our  Seasons Creek  and other near-term
    projects, and present a full-scale Organic Community  TM  neighborhood,  River City Park , available for occupancy
    by 2030.    

All
of our products are new to the construction industry, and therefore are presently unknown to other developers and builders. In
effort to expedite market awareness about our wall panels, we are currently planning to offer other builders and developers the
opportunity to purchase our products at discounted prices, which include basic training programs. We believe our products are
simple to understand and intuitive to use for any builder experienced in concrete construction. However, if an extensive training
would be required, we are offering such training at a price additional to the product price.  

Our
present and future business activities are structured in three principal segments:  

Engineering :
In the course of our engineering activities, we intend create and develop (a) proprietary construction systems and methods of
their assembly that would enable us and our partners to optimize the cost-benefit efficiency of construction process, (b) proprietary
building kits that, when prefabricated, would enable us and our partners build real estate properties at a lower cost and superior
speed, and (c) proprietary plans of development for our living communities that we market under our Organic Community  TM
 brand.  

Land
Development : In the course of our land development activities, we will manage the identification and acquisition of land suitable
for construction of our Organic Communities  TM  and preconstruction activities, including but not limited to earthwork,
site clearing, installation of utility lines, road creation, and other works necessary to result in the recordation of individual
lots ready for commencement of real estate property construction. Most of these works will be outsourced to independent contractors,
whereas we will oversee the contractors  performance based on our plans of development and project guidelines.  

Construction :
Our construction activities we will be diversified into two main segments: (1) managing our own projects, and (2) managing projects
in alliance with other developers and builders. In the course of managing our own projects, we will (i) manage the construction
of concrete walls using our proprietary wall panels, and (ii) manage the construction of properties based upon our proprietary
plans of development on our land conducted by other builders. In the course of managing projects in alliance with other builders,
we will (iii) oversee the construction of concrete walls performed by other builders using our proprietary wall panels, and (iv)
oversee the construction of properties by other builders using our proprietary building kits.  

Our
business objective is to enable us and our allied developers and builders to build real estate properties faster and economically
more profitable. To date, it has taken approximately 34 months to conduct engineering and technology research to analyze the construction
technologies available for an application in our pilot projects. During that period, we screened and analyzed hundreds of patents,
building novelties and processes. Within this period, on March 31,2015, we acquired proprietary building block and interlocking
construction method protected by a U.S. Patent Application 14/337,069 from our affiliate under common control, Helpful Technologies
Inc., a Florida corporation. We have also developed proprietary building block and interlocking construction method, for which
we filed a provisional U.S. Patent Application 62/222,424 on September 25, 2015, and proprietary wall panel, wall spacer, and
method of construction for which we filed a provisional U.S. Patent Application on October 10, 2016. As of the date of this report,
we have determined technologies encompassing our first line of products.  

In
August 2014, we started searching for suitable land for our pilot projects with an intention to build luxury townhomes in the
Miami-Dade and Palm Beach Counties of South Florida using the EVG-3D Panels. In both cases, we had to withdraw from negotiating
contracts due to the absence of product acceptance and lengthy process of receiving such acceptance from the respective county
officials. In September 2014, we were involved in our first pilot project, called  3089 Parkside,  which was a remodeling
of single family house in the Chicago, IL metro area. All works under this project were completed, and the property was sold within
third fiscal quarter of 2015. We were not allowed to use the EVG-3D Panels for this project due to lack of product acceptance
by local municipality. From March to May 2015, we were involved with three other construction projects in the Chicago, Illinois
area, from which we withdrew and switched our pilot-project focus to the Richmond, Virginia area. We believe that product acceptance
in the Richmond, Virginia metro area will be faster and less costly. In December 2015, we acquired approximately 28.8 continuous
acres of raw land in Chesterfield, Virginia for our first pilot project as described below, and are seeking land to undertake
more projects, in which we believe we will be able to test our technology and product performance.  

On
November 30, 2015, we formed a limited liability company in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Seasons Creek Development LLC, of which
the Company is currently the sole member, in order to purchase and develop a parcel of land consisting of approximately 28.8 acres
located in Chesterfield, Virginia. We consummated our purchase of the land on December 11, 2015. The land has been zoned to accommodate
up to 70 single family homes and currently holds a tentative plan of development approval. We intend to develop this land into
a residential subdivision to be called  Seasons Creek  consisting of 70 single family homes built with the novel construction
materials and methods we have researched. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have started engineering revisions
of our plan of development for the 70 buildable lots. We have no mortgage on this land. Based upon market analysis and preliminary
appraisals, we have concluded an as-is unimproved value of approximately $980,000 for the raw land, however, each appraisal is
subject to opinion and current market conditions which fluctuate and, therefore, investors should not rely on any appraisal that
they have not conducted themselves. In addition, due to a  grandfathered  approval pertaining to the development,
the Seasons Creek land features a waiver of cash proffers (a sum paid by the developer to the County in order defray capital facilities
costs associated with development) in the amount of approximately $18,966 per lot under plan of development, or approximately
$1.3 million for the 70 lots. Though this does not increase the actual raw value of the land, it may result in lower costs associated
with the actual development of the project and thus is an advantage towards the project as a whole. As of the date of this report,
we are attempting to leverage the Seasons Creek land in order to obtain a loan by leveraging the land s total combined 2015
tax appraisal of approximately $736,300 by Chesterfield County and approximately $1 million appraised value of such land. We presently
have no commitments from lenders and have nor are we currently in negotiations with any lenders. If we obtain such a loan, we
may use this loan for the Seasons Creek project implementation purposes.  

We
are currently in the final stages of completing engineering revisions of the plan of development for our Seasons Creek community,
and anticipate being able to obtain a land disturbance permit and for contractors to begin earthwork, utilities work, and other
land development works during second quarter of 2017.  

The
implementation of our business plan is lengthy and subject to several risks and obstacles. It is further subject to various uncertainties
and barriers to market entry. For example, our competitors may compete against us with products based on the technologies other
than the EVG-3D Panel technology, which may be more competitive than our products. Also, numerous other companies are developing
products based on the EVG-3D Panel technology, and such products (including materials, tools, and assembly methods) may be developed
more competitive than our products. Although we continue researching and screening other novel construction technologies, there
is no guarantee that we will be able to adopt these technologies for product development. Licensing the technologies from inventors
may require significant capital resources, which we do not have at this time and there is no guarantee that we will be able to
raise such resources in adequate amounts or at all. Also, licenses may be revoked or the technologies may become obsolete, in
which case the amount of license fees paid would be non-refundable. Even when we develop technologies in-house and file patents,
prosecuting and defending these patents will require additional capital, and there is no guarantee that, even if we raise such
capital and pay our patent agents and attorneys, such patents will be granted. If patents are granted, any party can request re-examination
of the patents, upon which the patents may be revoked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents may also be found infringing
on other patents, which may cause us being responsible for additional license and royalty fees. Our engineering and product development
efforts will require significant capital, including the proceeds from this Offering and beyond, and, although we believe the maximum
proceeds from this Offering will be sufficient funding our business operations as necessary to achieve planned growth over the
next 24 months, there is no guarantee that such capital will be available to us after effectuation of this Offering by the SEC
and FINRA on the terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, if we are successful in the technology implementation, engineering
and product development, the continuing testing of our products in pilot-test construction projects will require significant additional
capital. Our land and property purchases will require additional significant capital, and we cannot predict the then-current market
conditions, in which we would be required to raise such capital. We will be also subject to several other risks and obstacles
while implementing our business plan and operating our company. Even when we are successful in developing an expanding enterprise
with competitive products, we will face several risks and uncertainties. Please read  Business  and  Risk Factors 
sections for more information.  

Intellectual
Property   

At
the date of this report, we have three patent applications pending review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office:  

We
believe when issued, our patents should provide adequate protection of our intellectual properties. However, at the time of this
report, we cannot assure you that any of our patents would be granted or issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, nor if
issued, that such patents would not be challenged with reexamination, and, if so challenged, that such patents would be reaffirmed
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We cannot assure you that a third party would not infringe on our patents (when and if
issued) and that we will be able to adequately protect our patents and other intellectual properties if and as required. At the
date of this report, we cannot assure, that we will have the necessary financing to conduct our engineering research and development
activities on time or at all.  

As
we develop the proprietary building materials and methods, we envision using these novelties in both, remodeling and new construction
activities, which we believe will ultimately enable us increasing both, our construction revenues and our overall profit margins,
hence enabling us funding increasingly more money for our engineering and product development activities in our search for a faster
and less expensive construction, and further deployment of these products to the addressable markets.  

Subsidiaries   

Subsidiaries
operating within Land Development segment of our business activities:  

Seasons
Creek Development LLC : Our Seasons Creek Development LLC subsidiary is an entity holding the assets associated with our Seasons
Creek project. On December 11, 2015, through our subsidiary, Seasons Creek Development LLC, we purchased approximately 28.8 acres
of raw land located in Chesterfield, Virginia, which has been zoned to accommodate up to 70 single family homes and currently
holds a tentative plan of development approval. We intend to develop this land into a residential subdivision to be called  Seasons
Creek  to build 70 single family homes. We are planning to begin land development during fiscal year 2017. Consecutively,
we will begin building the 70 homes in our Seasons Creek neighborhood. We estimate the Seasons Creek project to take approximately
five years from the purchase of land to the complete sale of homes.  

On
October 19, 2016, we adopted First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement pursuant to which the authorized membership
interest which the LLC has authority to issue  preferred shares  (consisting of Class A Preferred Shares, Class B
Preferred Shares, Class C Preferred Shares) and Common Shares (the  Equity Securities ) as shall be determined by
the unanimous vote of the Members. To the extent funds of the LLC are available for distribution by the LLC (as determined by
the Managing Member in its sole discretion), the Managing Member shall cause the LLC to distribute to the Members s with respect
to each fiscal quarter of the LLC an amount of cash (a  Tax Distribution ) which in the good faith judgment of the
Managing Member equals (i) the amount of net taxable income (adjusted to take account of any net taxable losses of the LLC allocable
to the Shareholders in prior periods) of the LLC allocable to the Members in respect of such fiscal quarter, multiplied by (ii)
the sum of the highest marginal federal, state and local income tax rates applicable to an individual living in Chesterfield,
Virginia for the relevant type of taxable income, with such Tax Distribution to be made to the Members in the same proportions
that taxable income was allocated to the Members during such fiscal quarter. Tax Distributions shall be considered advance distributions
to Members. The Managing Member may in its sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) make distributions at any time or from
time to time, but shall make distributions in respect of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and/or Common Shares in
the following order of priority:  

First ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class A Preferred Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital
    with respect to all Class A Preferred Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution), until the aggregate
    Unreturned Capital with respect to the Class A Preferred Shares has been reduced to zero;   

Second ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class A Preferred Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital
    with respect to all Class A Preferred Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution) until the aggregate
    Unpaid Class A Return resulted in an IRR equal to 14.0% and has been reduced to zero;   

Third ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class B Preferred Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital
    with respect to all Class B Preferred Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution), until the aggregate
    Unreturned Capital with respect to the Class B Preferred Shares has been reduced to zero;

As of September 30,
2016, we owned and controlled 100% of Seasons Creek Development LLC, which comprised of 20 units of Class A Preferred Share
LLC Membership Interests and 1 unit of Common Share LLC Membership Interests issued on July 25, 2016 in consideration for cash
contribution of $250,000 in 2015 and bearing annual preferred yield of 14.0% on the land value appraised in $1.0 million and the
right for Class-A Profit Share of 30%. At the date of this report, we cannot assure, that we will have the necessary financing
to conduct our Seasons Creek project on time or at all. 

On October 19, 2016,
our subsidiary, Seasons Creek Development LLC issued 33% ownership structured in the form of 10 units of Class-B Preferred Share
LLC Membership Interests bearing 14.0% annual yield and the right for Class-B Preferred Profit Share of 30%. Both, the Class-B
Preferred Yield and the Class-B Preferred Profit Share are payable to Class-B LLC Member upon completion of the Seasons Creek
project or as declared by our Board of Directors for $50,000 per unit or aggregate $500,000 for 10 units. To the date of this
report we have received funds in amount of $250,000 that is equal to the purchase of 5 units. As a result from this sale, upon
receipt of funds in aggregate amount of $500,000 our ownership in Seasons Creek Development LLC will be diluted from 100% to 67%
and structured in form of 20 Units of Class-A Preferred Share LLC Membership Interests bearing 14.0% annual yield and Class-A
Preferred Profit Share of 30%, both payable to us upon completion of the Seasons Creek project or as declared by our Board of
Directors and 1 Unit Common Share LLC Membership Interests. Furthermore, upon completion of this sale, we have entered into the
Amended and Restated Exclusive Construction Management Agreement with new member of Seasons Creek Development LLC entitling us
to approximately $1.75 million in construction management fees payable to us upon completion of the Seasons Creek project. 

River
City Park LLC : On May 3, 2016, we formed a limited liability company in the Commonwealth of Virginia, River City Park LLC,
of which the Company currently owns 100%, in order to locate, purchase, and develop a parcel of land in Central Virginia that
we intend to consist of at least 400 acres located on a river. At the date of this report, we are seeking land and have not reached
any material agreements for an acquisition of such land. We intend develop such land and to build a mixed-use neighborhood comprising
at least 5 million square feet of buildable space, which would encompass our Organic Community ( TM  pending registration)
concept. Upon completion, we intend to create and operate a master association, which would oversee and the management of property
associations located within the community and would maintain and continually improve common areas, including but not limited to
parks, educational, healthcare and other facilities. While we are planning to sell certain properties within the community (for
example small-bay retail, condos, and single-family homes), we are planning to continue owning and operating certain other properties
(for example commercial plazas, office buildings, and apartment residence rentals). At the date of this report, we cannot assure,
that we will have the necessary financing to purchase of the land we contemplate purchasing for our River City Park project.  

Generally,
we intend to organize a new limited liability company for each project in the state of geographic location of the subject project
(each a  Project LLC ). The Project LLCs are taxable as a partnership. With few exceptions, we usually form each Project
LLC and initially purchase and own 100% of its equity upon payment of deposits on land under contract. Consecutively, we plan
to undertake private offerings of limited membership interests of the Project LLC for the amounts required to purchase land under
contract and conduct construction works. Upon receiving investments, our ownership and profit share in the Project LLC is diluted
based on the amounts contribute by investors into the project. There is no dilution of our Common Stock occurring upon receiving
investments into the Project LLC. Although we aim to own at least 51% of the limited membership interests in each Project LLC,
we often result in owning less than 51% of the limited membership interests in each Project LLC. For this reason, we may not have
the authority to exercise full control and requisite voting power over the Project LLC business affairs, including but not limited
the control over the implementation and payments under the operating agreements, which obliges the Project LLC to pay our construction
management fees. Notwithstanding the above statement, all decisions that may render a significant effect on the Project LLC business
require unanimous vote of all members, including our vote. These decisions include:  

(1)  
      Dissolution
    or winding up of the Project LLC;   

(2)  
      Any
    merger or consolidation of the Project LLC;   

(3)  
      Any
    sale, exchange, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, lease or other disposition or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets
    of the Project LLC;   

(4)  
      Declaration
    of any payment by the Project LLC beyond the payments approved by members   

(5)  
      Any
    amendment to the operating agreement of the Project LLC;   

(6)  
      Any
    amendment, restatement or revocation of the Articles of Organization of the Project LLC, except (a) as provided to effectuate
    a change in the principal place of business of the Project LLC, (b) to change the name of the Project LLC, (c) as required
    by applicable law;   

(7)  
      Any
    material change in the business purpose of the Project LLC;   

(8)  
      Any
    transfer of limited membership interest to any person;   

(9)  
      The
    incurrence of any indebtedness for borrowed money by the Project LLC;   

(10)  
      Any
    purchase, lease or other acquisition, in any single transaction or in a series of related transactions, of property or services
    or capital equipment inconsistent with an approved business plan;   

(11)  
      Any
    capital expenditures or series of related capital expenditures, that exceed the amount provided therefor in the most recently
    approved operating budget of the Project LLC (after taking into account any general spending overrun provisions contained
    in the approved business plan) or any commitment by the Project LLC to make expenditures in any project in an amount greater
    than the amount set forth in the approved operating budget of the homebuilding project carried out by the Project LLC;   

(12)  
      The
    acquisition of any business or entry into any partnership by the Project LLC;   

(13)  
      (a)
    the voluntary commencement or the failure to contest in a timely and appropriate manner any involuntary proceeding or the
    filing of any petition seeking relief under bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar laws, (b) the application for
    or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator or similar official for the Project LLC, or for
    a substantial part of their property or assets, (c) the filing of an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition
    filed against the Project LLC in any proceeding described above, (d) the consent to any order for relief issued with respect
    to any proceeding described herein, (e) the making of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (f) the admission
    in writing of the Project LLC s inability, or the failure of the Project LLC to pay its debts as they become due or
    the taking of any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing;   

(14)  
      Creation
    of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Project LLC; and   

(15)  
      Any
    other act that would make it impossible for the Project LLC to continue to operate the business of the Project LLC.   

Revenue   

To
date, a significant majority of our revenue has been derived from our real-estate financing activities, which we anticipate to
cease as we engage in increasingly more and more real-estate construction projects.  

Industry
Guide 3 requires statistical disclosure by Bank Holding Companies. Although a significant majority of our revenue has been derived
from our real-estate financing activities, we are not a banking institution and not a holding company, and therefore we believe
the requirements of Industry Guide 3 are not applicable to us. We have merely re-lent the cash received from our lenders to our
affiliate, Helpful Capital Group LLC (entity under common control) at a higher interest rate with the sole purpose of  parking 
our cash resources until we can use such cash for construction projects. We have  parked  our cash into financial
instruments only for a period of time required to complete designing our business model and screening novel construction technologies
we intend using in our future construction projects. Although a majority of our revenue to date has been derived from our financing
activities, the purpose of our financial activities was supplemental and secondary to our engineering and construction activities,
which are our main purpose and course of business. We engaged into financial activities in an attempt to decrease our operating
losses and reduce depletion of our cash resources during the start-up and business development stage by earning an interest surplus
to finance our working capital.  

We
plan sourcing revenues from (a) sale of our products, (b) sale of training programs and technical support associated with our
products, (c) licensing our intellectual property, (d) construction activities, and (e) equity distributions from our Project
LLCs. Our construction activities will comprise practical application of our proprietary products, construction methods, building
process, and know-how as outlined below in this section. Engaging in construction of concrete walls using our proprietary wall
panels, is expected to allow us to create short-term revenue streams, test our wall panels in real-time products, and use profits
to scale up our business, and to develop, measure, and prove the cost/time advantages that we plan on selling to our customers
and allies and use in the development of our proprietary building kits. Engaging into construction of new properties, such as,
including, but not limited to, the 70 homes in our Seasons Creek project, is expected to allow us to establish mid-term revenues
and profits. Engaging in the development of the master plans for our Organic Communities  TM  is expected to allow us
to form a long-term revenue pipeline with lasting benefits for our target market groups, as well as for our Company and stockholders.  

We
anticipate deriving a portion of our future revenues in form of   equity
distributions from our Project LLCs.  When we complete a building project and prior to a
liquidation of the Project LLC, we plan to derive, in addition to the construction management fee, revenue from the distribution
of our equity and profit share in the Project LLC. This income is reported to us by the Project LLC on IRS Form K-1. Our equity
and profit share is determined in accordance to the Project LLC s operating agreement, and generally varies upon a level
of our equity contribution into the Project LLC. For example, if upon organization of the Project LLC, we contribute cash in the
amount required for placing a deposit on a land purchase which equals to 20% of the land purchase price, and our building partners
contribute cash equal to 80% of the land purchase price, our equity contribution is considered at 20%, and, therefore, our equity
share in the net income of the Project LLC is also considered to be 20%. If, for further example, we contribute our corporate
guarantees for the repayment of construction loans the Project LLC undertakes to finance building of property on the land, we
may receive, on a per case basis, an additional equity share in the Project LLC. Also for further example, if during the construction
phase, we agree to defer our construction management fees till the completion of the project, we may receive, on a per case basis,
an additional equity share in the Project LLC. Each time we receive any membership equity share in the Project LLC, such equity
share is recorded by amendment of the appropriate Exhibit A of the operating agreement for the Project LLC. Because the project
LLCs are formed for the purposes of carrying out a construction project, we recognize this revenue as revenue from our construction
activities. We consider a building project completed when the property owned by the project LLC is sold. The value of the LLC
membership equity subject to distribution to us and other LLC members, if any, is calculated by deducting the total capitalized
costs and the project operating expenses from the gross profit of the project LLC calculated in accordance to GAAP. The gross
profit is determined by deducting the realtor commissions and closing costs from the aggregate sale amount for which the property
owned by the project LLC is sold. Our construction management fees are deducted from the gross profit, among other operating expenses
of the Project LLC   

We
plan on selling the properties we build, directly and in cooperation with our strategic partners, through licensed real estate
brokers and their associate realtors. Our marketing strategy is focused on advertising through digital and social media, including
Internet websites, which we intend to allow us to incrementally decrease marketing costs and market the properties we build to
buyers in combination with mortgage payment calculators and other digital tools available throughout the Internet. We also intend
to advertise through traditional marketing sources, including but not limited to newspapers and local and regional publications.  

Cost
of Revenue    

Cost
of revenue primarily consists of our inventory of home kits, as well as (when and if we engage into the manufacturing of our home
kits) manufacturing, packaging, assembly and testing costs for our home kits, shipping costs, costs of contracted labor, including
stock-based compensation, warranty costs and write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. Because currently our activities in
the home kit segment are limited to engineering and market research, and because we currently have no inventory for resale, we
have no cost of revenue.  

Gross
Profit     

Gross
profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost of revenue. We price our properties based on market and competitive
conditions in local markets, and from time to time may reduce the price per square feet of our products as market and competitive
conditions change. If we are unable to decrease the cost of our products in line with the sale price decrease, we may experience
a reduction in our gross profit and gross margin.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling,
general and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel related expenses (including stock based compensation), sales
commissions, field inspection expenses, travel expenses, professional and consulting fees, legal fees, depreciation expense, and
other operating expenses. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute basis in the future
as we expand our involvement into construction projects and hire more project management, sales, marketing, finance and administrative
personnel, and we incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expense primarily consists of prototyping and testing of prototypes of novel construction methods and instruments,
and personnel related expenses (including stock based compensation), intellectual property license costs, engineering design development
costs, technology evaluation costs, depreciation expense and other expenses related to our research and development of novel construction
methods. Research and development activities include the design of new construction elements, methods, systems and processes,
refinement of existing elements, methods, systems and processes and product development, including obtaining the appropriate product
approvals to ensure compliance with required architectural specifications and building codes. All research and development costs
are expensed as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase on an absolute basis as we continue to expand
our involvements into developing novel construction elements, methods, systems and processes.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense consists of interest expense related to our obligations under convertible debt and non-convertible debt.  

Zimas
    $1 Million Note and Amended and Restated Zimas Note : In April 2013, we issued an unsecured non-recourse convertible promissory
    note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 to Zimas LLC, a principal stockholder. The note accrued interest at an annual rate
    of 8.0%, payable annually, matured on March 31, 2016, and was convertible into common stock at a conversion rate of $1.60
    per share. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of accrued interest was $80,000, which was paid in January 2016. The full amount
    of principal and accrued interest was due and payable within 30 days from maturity date. During the nine months ended September
    30, 2016 and 2015, the Company made payments for interest totaling $80,000 and $80,000, respectively. The note was payable
    upon demand at any time before the maturity date upon 100 days  prior notice. However, upon early demand, the outstanding
    principal amount would have been discounted 20% and an early termination penalty will apply. Zimas LLC is owned and controlled
    by Ms. Zena Katz, who is the sister of Ms. Fay Katz, a 75% owner of FVZ, LLC, a founder and principal stockholder of the Company.
    On April 29, 2016, Zimas and the Company entered into in a Loan Amendment and Extension Agreement (the  Note Extension
    Agreement ) pursuant to which (i) the note s maturity date was extended to June 30, 2016 with increased interest
    accruing at the non-compounding rate of 10.0% for the period from April 1, 2016 and ending at the earlier of (a) date of repayment,
    or (b) on June 30, 2016 and (ii) the note was no longer secured by or convertible into 625,000 shares of common stock. In
    connection with the Note Extension Agreement, the Company issued Zimas a warrant exercisable for 625,000 shares of common
    stock for $1.60 per share from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2028. This warrant was valued using the Black-Scholes model
    using a volatility of 87.85% (derived using the average volatility of three similar public companies), an expected term of
    1.7 years and a discount rate of 0.77%. The fair value of the warrant of $434,182 was treated as a debt discount on the note
    payable. The debt discount was amortized over the life of the note, which was due on June 30, 2016 and amortization of debt
    discount expense of $434,182 was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company has no rights to redeem the
    warrant. The warrant also specifies that if Zimas exercises and continues to own more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock,
    Zimas will be entitled to nominate representative to the Company s Board of Directors. On May 16, 2016, we paid Zimas
    the amount of $400,000 from the amount of $510,000 received from assignment of our first mortgage on real property located
    in Miami, FL to Thriving Investments pursuant to a Stipulation of Settlement, entered into on March 31, 2016, among HCG, Thriving
    Investments and FVZ, LLC. As of May 16, 2016, the amount of accrued interest was $32,548 under the convertible $1 Million
    Zimas note. The Company is in default for non-payment of the interest. Restated and amended note for the remaining amount
    due under convertible note of $600,000 was issued as a non-convertible note on May 16, 2016. The note accrues interest at
    an annual rate of 10.0%, payable quarterly, and matured on June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 the amount of accrued interest
    was $22,520. This note is in default for non-payment of principal and interest from July 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016,
    we owe Zimas under the restated and amended non-convertible note the principal amount of $600,000 and accrued interest of
    $55,068, or the aggregate of $655,068. We anticipate financing the repayment of $655,068 from obtaining new investments into
    (i) the Company and/or (ii) subsidiary Project LLC companies.   

Net
Loss   

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,062,643 and $248,281for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net operating loss of $814,362 was attributed to our active
engagement into construction activities, which caused a gradual increase in operating expenses as we were withdrawing from financial
assistance activities and focusing our operation on purchase and development of land for construction.  

Income
taxes   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements
and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences
reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending upon the classification of the
asset or liabilities to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified
as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10  Uncertainty in Income Taxes  (ASC 740-10). Certain recognition
thresholds must be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue
to recognize tax positions that meet a  more-likely-than-not  threshold. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions that would require either recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial
statements.

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 (Unaudited)    

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 we had a net loss
of $268,689, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net loss of $138,979, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share during
the three months ended September 30, 2015, which is an increase of 93%. The change in net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015     was mainly caused by the increased operating expense
as we became more active in organizing a revenue stream from our construction activities as well as 91% decrease in total revenue
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as
a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital, implement its business plan, and generate
significant revenues.  

Revenue    

Our
financial activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 have produced $6,390 in revenue, consisting of interest
income, which is a decrease of 91% as compared to $73,532 in revenue of which $37,860 was from interest income and $35,672 was
earned from construction activities during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue from financial activities
is indicative of our withdrawal from the financial activities. The engagement within the financial activities segment was solely
aimed at re-lending the cash received from our lenders at the higher interest rate in an attempt to decrease our operating losses
and reduce depletion of our cash resources during the start-up and business development stage by earning an interest surplus to
finance our working capital. Although a majority of our revenue to date has been derived from our financing activities, the purpose
of our financial activities was supplemental and secondary to our engineering and construction activities, which are our main
purpose and course of business. As the notes reach their respective maturity, or are being repaid to us prior to their maturity
dates, we use the proceeds to fund our homebuilding projects, including but not limited to remitting deposits on land, paying
personnel salaries, architectural and civil engineering and other expenses in order to generate revenue from our homebuilding
projects. In September 2014 we have engaged into our first pilot project, called 3890 Parkside, which was a remodeling of single
family house in the Chicago, IL metro area. All works under this project were completed, and the property was sold and closed
on within third fiscal quarter of 2015. In December 2015, we also formed Seasons Creek Development LLC in the Commonwealth of
Virginia for the purpose of acquiring the land and existing property with the purpose of building and selling a residential single-family
homes to general public. Subsequently, in December 2015, we acquired land held for future development in Commonwealth of Virginia
at historical cost of $211,336, which represents the purchase price. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company
incurred costs attributable to the development activities in amount of $116,811, which were capitalized. We anticipate that starting
from 2017, the revenue from construction activities will constitute the majority of our revenue.  

Operating
Expenses    

Our
total operating expenses during three months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $275,079, which is an increase of approximately
29% from the total operating expenses of $212,561 during three months ended September 30, 2015. The following table illustrates
the summary of our operating loss for the periods indicated:  

Selling,
general and administrative expenses    

Selling,
general and administrative expenses costs include officer compensation, salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense,
consulting fees, legal expenses, accounting and auditing fees, investor relations costs, insurance, reporting costs and fees,
and corporate overhead related costs. Total selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $275,079 as compared to $212,561 for the same period of 2015. The increase of approximately 29% was primarily caused
by the increased operating expense as we became more active in organizing a revenue stream from our construction activities, as
well as an increase in operating expenses in connection with the preparation of our Form S-1 and the amendments thereto. As we
continue to further develop our business, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in
absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we become profitable.  

Interest
expenses    

Interest
expense is related to our obligations under our convertible debt and non-convertible debt and totaled to $30,627 and $28,342 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The approximate 8% increase in interest expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was due to increased weighted average of total amount of debt securities during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income     

Other
income consisted primarily of processing fees and other fees received in connection with the repayment of the notes receivable
to us as well and totaled to $0 and $50 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was insignificant.  

Net
Loss    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $268,689. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our net loss
was $138,979. This increase in net loss of approximately 93% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
same period in 2015 was mainly caused by the increased operating expense as we became more active in organizing a revenue stream
from our construction activities, an increase in operating expenses in connection with public company compliance, as well as 91%
decrease in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As we continue to further develop our business, we anticipate
that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of total
revenues as we become profitable from our homebuilding activities.

per share    

We
reported net loss of $268,689, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
net loss of $138,979, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in loss
attributable to Common Stockholders per share, basic and diluted, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
for the same period in 2015 was caused by the increase in net loss of approximately 93%.  

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 (Unaudited)    

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, we ended nine months ended September 30, 2016     with
net loss of $1,062,643, or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net loss of $248,281, or $0.11 per basic and diluted
share during nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is an increase of 328%. The change in net loss in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015     was mainly caused by the increased operating
expense as we became more active in organizing a revenue stream from our construction activities, as well as an increase in operating
expenses in connection with the preparation of our Form S-1 and amortization of debt discount expense in connection to issuance
of warrant. On April 29, 2016, the Company issued a warrant in consideration of the extension of the maturity date of convertible
note payable with principal amount of $1,000,000 to June 30, 2016, to purchase up to an aggregate of 625,000 shares of Common
stock of the Company, at an exercise price of $1.60 per share of Common Stock, exercisable in full or in part at any time vesting
from January 1, 2018 and expiring on December 31, 2028. The fair value of the warrant of $434,182 was treated as a debt discount
on the note payable. The debt discount was amortized over the life of the note, which was due on June 30, 2016 and amortization
of debt discount expense of $434,182 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital, implement its business plan, and generate significant
revenues.  

Revenue    

Our
financial activities during nine months ended September 30, 2016 have produced total amount of $144,795 or $21,081 in interest
income and $124,214 of proceeds from the foreclosure and sale of one note, which is in total a decrease of 13% as compared to
$166,579 revenue of which $130,907 was from interest income and $35,672 was earned from construction activities during nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Although there was slight decrease in total in revenue, there was substantial decrease in interest income
of approximately 84%, which is indicative of our withdrawal from the financial activities. Although a majority of our revenue
to date has been derived from our financing activities, the purpose of our financial activities was supplemental and secondary
to our construction and engineering activities, which are our main purpose and course of business. As the notes reach their respective
maturity, or are being repaid to us prior to their maturity dates, we use the proceeds to fund our homebuilding projects, including
but not limited to remitting deposits on land, paying personnel salaries, architectural and civil engineering and other expenses
in order to generate revenue from our homebuilding projects. In September 2014 we have engaged into our first pilot project, called
3890 Parkside, which was a remodeling of single family house in the Chicago, IL metro area. All works under this project were
completed, and the property was sold and closed on within third fiscal quarter of 2015. During the first four months of 2015 we
also invested $775,000 in construction projects in Chicago, IL area, from which we withdrew in September 2015. In March, 2015
we paid $180,000 and $235,000 to acquire 5% equity stake in 228 Racine LLC and 7820 Madison LLC, respectively, and in April 2015
we paid $360,000 to acquire 5% equity stake in 2709 Ashland LLC. In December 2015, we also have formed Seasons Creek Development
LLC in the Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose of acquiring the land and existing property with the purpose of building and
selling a residential single-family homes to general public. Subsequently, in December 2015, we acquired land held for future
development in Commonwealth of Virginia for $211,336. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred costs
attributable to the development activities in amount of $116,811, which were capitalized. We anticipate that starting from 2017
the revenue from construction activities will constitute the majority of our revenue.  

Operating
Expenses    

Our
total operating expenses during nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $1,207,554, which is an increase of approximately
191% from the total operating expenses of $415,011 during nine months ended September 30, 2015. The following table illustrates
the summary of our operating loss for the periods indicated:  

Selling,
general and administrative expenses    

Selling,
general and administrative expenses costs include officer compensation, salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense,
consulting fees, legal expenses, accounting and auditing fees, investor relations costs, insurance, reporting costs and fees,
bad debt recovery, amortization of debt discount and corporate overhead related costs. Total selling, general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,207,554 as compared to $415,011 for the same period of 2015. The
increase of approximately 191% was primarily caused by the increased operating expense as we became more active in organizing
a revenue stream from our construction activities, as well as an increase in operating expenses in connection with public company
compliance and amortization of debt discount expense in connection to issuance of warrant. On April 29, 2016, the Company issued
a warrant in consideration of the extension of the maturity date of convertible note payable with principal amount of $1,000,000
to June 30, 2016, to purchase up to an aggregate of 625,000 shares of Common stock of the Corporation, at an exercise price of
$1.60 per share of Common Stock, exercisable in full or in part at any time vesting from January 1, 2018 and expiring on December
31, 2028. The fair value of the warrant of $434,182 was treated as a debt discount on the note payable. The debt discount was
amortized over the life of the note, which was due on June 30, 2016 and amortization of debt discount expense of $434,182 was
recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As we continue to further develop our business, we anticipate that our
selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of total revenues
as we become profitable.  

Interest
expenses    

Interest
expense is related to our obligations under our convertible and non-convertible debt and totaled to $88,728 and $99,102 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 10% decrease in interest expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was due to decreased weighted average of total amount of debt securities in 2016 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income     

Other
income consisted primarily of processing fees and other fees received in connection with the repayment of the notes receivable
to us as well and totaled to $116 and $151 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was insignificant.  

Net
Loss    

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $1,062,643. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net loss
was of $248,281. This increase in net loss of approximately 328% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
same period in 2015 was mainly caused by the increased operating expense as we became more active in organizing a revenue stream
from our construction activities, an increase in operating expenses in connection with public company compliance and amortization
of debt discount expense in connection to issuance of warrant. On April 29, 2016, the Company issued a warrant in consideration
of the extension of the maturity date of convertible note payable with principal amount of $1,000,000 to June 30, 2016, to purchase
up to an aggregate of 625,000 shares of Common stock of the Corporation, at an exercise price of $1.60 per share of Common Stock,
exercisable in full or in part at any time vesting from January 1, 2018 and expiring on December 31, 2028. The fair value of the
warrant of $434,182 was treated as a debt discount on the note payable. The debt discount was amortized over the life of the note,
which was due on June 30, 2016 and amortization of debt discount expense of $434,182 was recorded for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. As we continue to further develop our business, we anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses
will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we become profitable from our construction
activities.  

Loss
per share    

We
reported net loss of $1,062,643, or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to net loss of $248,281, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase of in
loss attributable to Common Stockholders per share, basic and diluted, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to for the same period in 2015 was caused by the increase in net loss of approximately 328% as well as by the decrease of our
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. In January, 2015, our founders, FVZ LLC, Dr. Temnikov and Mr. Gurin, have
converted the aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock into the equivalent number of shares of Series-X Common Stock. As
a result of such conversion, the number of Shares outstanding has decreased to 2,000,000 shares. 10,000,000 shares of common stock
were outstanding from January 1, 2015 to January 10, 2015 and the 8,000,000 shares of common stock were converted into 8,000,000
shares of Series-X Common Stock on January 10, 2015. On March 31, 2015, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger
( Merger ), by and between Helpful Technologies, Inc. ( HTI ), HAC Patents LLC ( HAC-LLC )
a wholly owned subsidiary of HTI, and Helpful Alliance Company (the  Company ), the Company acquired all of the membership
interests of HAC Patents LLC in exchange for 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock. 2,100,000 shares of common stock
were issued and outstanding from March 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the weighted
average number of shares of common stock (basic and diluted) resulted in 2,100,000 as compared to 2,360,073 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
  Capital Resources   

At
September 30, 2016, we had $18,834 cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of $2,052,441. In order to finance our operating capital,
our founders and majority stockholders are funding the Company s operations by the purchase of promissory notes. Other than
the promissory notes purchased, there is no written agreement or arrangement pursuant to which the founders or a third party have
agreed to purchase additional notes or otherwise fund our operations. From January 2016 to the date of this report on Form 10-Q
, the Company received an aggregate amount of $547,000 for notes payable issued from our founders, directly and through the affiliated
companies operated by the founders, which accrue non-compounding interest at annual rates ranging from 5% to 12.5% and mature
on December 31, 2017. Gurin Group LLC, a limited liability company of which Sergey Gurin, the Company s VP, Interim CFO
and director, has voting and dispositive control, had loaned the Company an aggregate amount of $205,000 of which the Company
on September 30,2016 repaid $200,000 by assignment of notes receivable due to the Company with aggregate principal amount of $200,000
in non-cash transaction, Sergey Gurin has loaned $127,000, Dr. Temnikov has loaned the Company an aggregate amount of $205,000
and FVZ LLC has loaned the Company an amount of $10,000. On May 16, 2016, we received funds owed to us for the note receivable
dated May 2013, with a value of $420,000 but the remaining principal amount of $330,000 plus accrued and payable interest on such
amount, which was assigned to the Company in November 2013 by our affiliate, Helpful Capital Group, LLC ( HCG ), a
Florida limited liability company. The note accrued interest at an annual rate of 12.0% with a maturity date of May 2013, and
the note had gone into default for non-payment of interest, therefore the interest rate increased to 18% per the default provision
in this note. In December 2014, a payment of $66,495 for accrued interest was received. This note was in default and the HCG filed
for foreclosure in July 2015. The collateral for the loan was real estate property located at 111 NE 43 St., Miami, FL 33137 (the
 Property ). The Company obtained a third-party appraisal in November 2015. The Property was appraised at $900,000,
which supported the carrying value of the note. A motion for summary judgment was filed by the HCG in December 2015. As of March
31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amount of accrued interest was $55,786 and $55,786, respectively. On March 31, 2016, the principal
and accrued and payable interest under the note was $385,786. On March 31, 2016, HCG entered into a Settlement Agreement with
Thriving Investments, LLC, the holder of a second mortgage on the property ( Thriving ), and FVZ, LLC pursuant to
which Thriving had agreed to pay HCG a total of $510,000 in consideration for HCG assigning its first mortgage on the property
to Thriving and HCG and FVZ, LLC delivering a Certificate of Title of the Property to Thriving. The said sum of $510,000 was transferred
to HCG s attorney s escrow account on April 4, 2016 and was released to us on May 16, 2016 upon transfer of the Certificate
of Title to the Property to Thriving on May 14, 2016. The Company recorded a $124,214 gain on settlement as of May 16, 2016, the
date the settlement amount of $510,000 was received by the Company. We anticipate receiving approximately $700,000 by leveraging
our Seasons Creek land to either (i) obtain a loan using the land as collateral, or (ii) sell part of our equity in the land for
cash, for which no arrangements have been made to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that we will be able
to fund our operations for the next six months with our current cash on hand in combination with capital we anticipate receiving
from time to time in form of (i) stockholder loans from our founders and executive officers Dr. Temnikov and Mr. Gurin, (ii) loans
from AssetsTZ Holding LLC, (iii) leveraging of our Seasons Creek land, (iv) sale of our Common shares in this offering. In their
report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2014, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  

If
needed, we intend to fund our future operations through the sale of equity and/or debt securities. Also, in order to fund any
working capital deficiencies or finance unforeseen transaction costs in connection with intended business, our founders or our
executive officers, may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. We do not have any verbal or written binding
agreement with any of our founders, executive officers or directors. We would repay such loaned amounts out of the net offering
proceeds of consecutive offerings or out of the operating income.  

Cash
Flows   

The
following table presents a summary of net cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the
periods indicated:  

Operating
Activities.   Operating activities used net cash of $244,335 and provided $608,542 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in net operating cash flows primarily reflected increased operating expense, in particular
increased compensation and interest paid on the debt obligations as well as increased costs for land development in amount of
$116,811 and amortization of debt discount expense of $434,182, which were partially offset by receipt of two notes receivable
with principal amount of $81,000 and $330,000 or aggregate amount of $411,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and a receipt of $390,927 due from affiliate as well as repayment of four notes receivable with principal amount of $50,000, $150,000,
$160,000 and $350,000 or aggregate amount of $710,000, which was partially offset by issuing a note receivable in amount of $10,000
to affiliated company as well as cash used for operating expense and interest paid on debt obligations during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Investing
Activities.   Investing activities used $3,506 and $0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Investing activities used cash for payment of $3,506 for attorney and filing fees for our patent application during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016.  

Financing
Activities.   Financing activities provided net cash of $52,000 and used $60,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financing activities provided $542,000 by receipt of notes payable from the Company s founder,
Dr. Temnikov, in amount of $200,000, from the Company s founder, Mr. Gurin, in amount of $127,000, from affiliated company,
FVZ LLC, in amount of $10,000, and from affiliated company, Gurin Group LLC, in amount of $205,000, of which $200,000 was repaid
to Gurin Group LLC by the Company by assignment of notes receivable due to the Company with aggregate principal amount of $200,000
in non-cash transaction, all of which was partially offset by repayment of $400,000 for note payable with original principal amount
of $1,000,000 which was due by June 30, 2016 and repurchase of Series-X common stock in amount of $90,000 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 financing activities used cash for partial repayment
of note payable to Marusya Pro LLC in amount of $150,000 and to Mr. Andrienko in amount of $10,000 which was offset by receipt
of proceeds of $100,000 from the warrant purchase by an affiliated company, AssetTZ LLC.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $18,834 on hand, as compared to the cash on hand of $214,784 we had at December 31, 2015.

believe that we will need at a minimum of $1,500,000 for the next 12 months in order to sufficiently fund our general and administrative
expenses, as planned, including hiring the minimally required personnel, funding research and development and marketing, expenses.
We will need an additional $2,300,000 to fund our intended construction and land development operations, including developing
and building homes on the 28.8-acre parcel of land we acquired Chesterfield County, VA.

1. LEGAL MATTERS   

Legal
Proceedings   

In
the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in legal proceedings from time to time. At the date of this Quarterly Report

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

In
addition to the risk factors stated in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on August 23, 2016 and declared effective by the Commission on September 8, 2016, the following risk factors relate to our construction
operations.  

We
may be unable to manufacture wall panels and or building kits at a reasonable price or at all.     

We
may be unable to locate a manufacturer willing and able to produce our wall panel and/or our building kits at a reasonable cost
or at all. This may be due to reasons including, but not limited to, availability and price of raw materials, cost of manufacturing,
cost of shipping, minimum order quantity, and production time. Even if we are successful in manufacturing our wall panel and or
building kit designs, we may be unable to find a licensed contractor willing to work with our wall panels and or building kits.
Our inability to have our wall panels and/or building kits produced or to locate a contractor to use them, could have an adverse
material effect on our business operations and stockholder value.  

Manufacturer
of wall panels and or building kits may manufacture our products improperly.    

While
we will make every effort to ensure that our wall panels and or building kits are produced properly through prototyping and sampling,
we cannot guarantee that the final product will be produced to our design and quality specifications. In such a case the manufacturer
may refuse to take responsibility for errors or poor craftsmanship. In the event that we use a foreign manufacturer for our products
our access to legal action may be limited and legal action available may be excessively time and financially excessive. As a result,
manufacturer error may lead to loss of capital invested and financial burden detrimental to our company.

ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.   

Zimas
$1 Million Note and Amended and Restated Zimas Note : In April 2013, we issued an unsecured non-recourse convertible promissory
note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 to Zimas LLC, a principal stockholder. The note accrued interest at an annual rate
of 8.0%, payable annually, matured on March 31, 2016, and was convertible into common stock at a conversion rate of $1.60 per
share. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of accrued interest was $80,000, which was paid in January 2016. The full amount of
principal and accrued interest was due and payable within 30 days from maturity date. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company made payments for interest totaling $80,000 and $80,000, respectively. The note was payable upon demand
at any time before the maturity date upon 100 days  prior notice. However, upon early demand, the outstanding principal
amount would have been discounted 20% and an early termination penalty will apply. Zimas LLC is owned and controlled by Ms. Zena
Katz, who is the sister of Ms. Fay Katz, a 75% owner of FVZ, LLC, a founder and principal stockholder of the Company. On April
29, 2016, Zimas and the Company entered into in a Loan Amendment and Extension Agreement (the  Note Extension Agreement )
pursuant to which (i) the note s maturity date was extended to June 30, 2016 with increased interest accruing at the non-compounding
rate of 10.0% for the period from April 1, 2016 and ending at the earlier of (a) date of repayment, or (b) on June 30, 2016 and
(ii) the note was no longer secured by or convertible into 625,000 shares of common stock. In connection with the Note Extension
Agreement, the Company issued Zimas a warrant exercisable for 625,000 shares of common stock for $1.60 per share from January
1, 2018 to December 31, 2028. This warrant was valued using the Black-Scholes model using a volatility of 87.85% (derived using
the average volatility of three similar public companies), an expected term of 1.7 years and a discount rate of 0.77%. The fair
value of the warrant of $434,182 was treated as a debt discount on the note payable. The debt discount was amortized over the

of our first mortgage on real property located in Miami, FL to Thriving Investments pursuant to a Stipulation of Settlement, entered
into on March 31, 2016, among HCG, Thriving Investments and FVZ, LLC. As of May 16, 2016, the amount of accrued interest was $32,548
under the convertible $1 Million Zimas note. The Company is in default for non-payment of the interest. Restated and amended note
for the remaining amount due under convertible note of $600,000 was issued as a non-convertible note on May 16, 2016. The note
accrues interest at an annual rate of 10.0%, payable quarterly, and matured on June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 the amount
of accrued interest was $22,520. This note is in default for non-payment of principal and interest from July 1, 2016. As of September
30, 2016, we owe Zimas under the restated and amended non-convertible note the principal amount of $600,000 and accrued interest
of $55,068, or the aggregate of $655,068. We anticipate financing the repayment of $655,068 from obtaining new investments into

Capital Contributions made by such Member and such Member s share of items of income and gain allocated to such Member pursuant
to Article IV and (b) decreased by such Member s share of items of loss, deduction and expense allocated to such Member

regulation and Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( g ) to reflect a revaluation of LLC property.  

(b)
For purposes of computing the amount of any item of LLC income, gain, loss or deduction to be allocated pursuant to  Article
IV  and to be reflected in the Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be
the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization used for this purpose); provided that:  

(i)
The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall include those items described in Code Section 705(a)(1)(B)

items are not includable in gross income or are not deductible for federal income tax purposes.  

(ii)
If the Book Value of any LLC property is adjusted pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( e ) or ( f ),
the amount of such adjustment shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such property.

its adjusted basis for tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Book Value of such property.

(v)

pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( m ), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts,

of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis).  

3.4
Negative Capital Accounts.  No Shareholder shall be required to pay to any other Shareholder or the LLC any deficit or negative
balance which may exist from time to time in such Shareholder s Capital Account (including upon and after dissolution of

loans shall be a debt of the LLC to such Member and shall be payable or collectible in accordance with the terms and conditions
upon which such loans are made;  provided , that such terms and conditions are no more favorable to such lending Member than
those which would be agreed to in an orderly transaction with a willing, unaffiliated lender in an arm s-length transaction.

Distributions In-Kind.  To the extent that the LLC distributes property in-kind to the Members, the LLC shall be treated as
making a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of such property for purposes of  Section 4.1  and such property shall

the Code or applicable Treasury Regulation) and any resulting gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members  Capital Accounts

The Managing Member may, based upon an approval by Majority Vote of the Members, either (i) cause the LLC to contribute all or

and dissolve the LLC, (ii) elect to have all Shareholders contribute their Shares to a corporation, in a transaction qualifying
under Section 351(a) of the Code, as long as the value of the shares of the corporation received by all Shareholders has a value
equal to the value of the Shares transferred, or (iii) otherwise cause the LLC to convert into a corporation, by way of merger,
consolidation or otherwise, so long as such conversion does not result in any material liability (including any material liability
for Taxes) of any of the Shareholders without their consent and provided that the value of the shares of the corporation received
by each Shareholder has a value equal to the value of the Shares transferred. Subject to the foregoing and to  Section 3.10(b) ,

AND ALLOCATIONS   

4.1
Distributions.   

(a)
 Tax Distributions.  To the extent funds of the LLC are available for distribution by the LLC (as determined by the Managing
Member in its sole discretion), the Managing Member shall cause the LLC to distribute to the Shareholders with respect to each
Fiscal Quarter of the LLC an amount of cash (a   Tax Distribution  ) which in the good faith judgment of the
Managing Member equals (i) the amount of net taxable income (adjusted to take account of any net taxable losses of the LLC allocable
to the Shareholders in prior periods) of the LLC allocable to the Shareholders in respect of such Fiscal Quarter, multiplied by
(ii) the sum of the highest marginal federal, state and local income tax rates applicable to an individual living in Chesterfield,
Virginia for the relevant type of taxable income, with such Tax Distribution to be made to the Shareholders in the same proportions
that taxable income was allocated to the Shareholders during such Fiscal Quarter. Tax Distributions shall be considered advance
Distributions to Shareholders under  Section 4.1(b) .  

(b)
 Other Distributions.  Except as otherwise set forth in  Section 4.1(a) , the Managing Member may in its sole discretion
(but shall not be obligated to) make Distributions at any time or from time to time, but shall make distributions in respect of
Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and/or Common Shares in the following order of priority:  

(i)  
       first ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class A Preferred Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital
    with respect to all Class A Preferred Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution), until the aggregate
    Unreturned Capital with respect to the Class A Preferred Shares has been reduced to zero;   

(ii)  
       second ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class A Preferred Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital
    with respect to all Class A Preferred Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution) until the aggregate
    Unpaid Class A Return resulted in an IRR equal to 14.0% and has been reduced to zero;   

(iii)  
       third ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class B Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital with
    respect to all Class B Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution), until the aggregate Unreturned
    Capital with respect to the Class B Shares has been reduced to zero;   

(iv)  
       fourth ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class B Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital with
    respect to all Class B Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution) until the aggregate Unpaid
    Class B Return resulted in an IRR equal to 14.0% and has been reduced to zero;   

(v)  
       fifth ,
    to the holders of outstanding Class C Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital with

    Class C Return resulted in an IRR equal to 12.0% and has been reduced to zero;   

(vii)  
       seventh,
     to the holders of outstanding Common Shares (ratably among such holders based upon the aggregate Unreturned Capital with
    respect to all Common Shares held by each such holder immediately prior to such Distribution) until the aggregate Unreturned
    Capital with respect to the Common Shares has been reduced to zero;   

(viii)

(ix)  
       ninth,
     to the holders of outstanding Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Common Shares (ratably among such holders

    Class A Profit Share, Class B Profit Share, Class C Profit Share, and Common Profit Share percentile of the Profit as determined
    by the Subscription Agreement. The intent of this  Section 4.1(b)(ix)  is to ensure that any Class A Profit Share, Class
    B Profit Shares, Class C Profit Shares, and/or Common Profit Shares issued after the date of this Agreement qualify as  profits
    interests  under Revenue Procedure 93-27, I.R.B. 1993-24 (June 9, 1993) and Revenue Procedure 2001-43, I.R.B. 2001-34
    (August 2, 2001).   

4.2
Allocations.  Except as otherwise provided in  Section 4.3  and  Section 4.5 , Profits and Losses for any Fiscal
Year shall be allocated among the Shareholders in such a manner that, as of the end of such Fiscal Year, the sum of (i) the Capital
Account of each Shareholder, (ii) such Shareholder s share of Minimum Gain (as determined according to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(g)) and (iii) such Shareholder s partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(3)) shall be equal to the respective net amounts, positive or negative, which would be distributed to them
or for which they would be liable to the LLC under the Virginia Act or otherwise, determined as if all unvested Shares were to
vest and the LLC were to (i) liquidate the assets of the LLC for an amount equal to their Book Value and (ii) distribute the proceeds
of liquidation pursuant to  Section 12.2 .  

4.3
Special Allocations.   

(a)
Losses attributable to partner nonrecourse debt (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(4)) shall be allocated in
the manner required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If there is a net decrease during a Taxable Year in partner nonrecourse
debt minimum gain (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(3)), Profits for such Taxable Year (and, if necessary,
for subsequent Taxable Years) shall be allocated to the Shareholders in the amounts and of such character as determined according
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4). This  Section 4.3(a)  is intended to be a  partner nonrecourse debt minimum
gain chargeback  provision that complies with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.  

(b)
Nonrecourse deductions (as determined according to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(1)) for any Taxable Year shall be allocated
to each Shareholder ratably among such Shareholders based upon the number of outstanding Class A Shares held by each such Shareholder
immediately prior to such allocation. Except as otherwise provided in  Section 4.3(a) , if there is a net decrease in the
Minimum Gain during any Taxable Year, each Shareholder shall be allocated Profits for such Taxable Year (and, if necessary, for
subsequent Taxable Years) in the amounts and of such character as determined according to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f).
This  Section 4.3(b)  is intended to be a Minimum Gain chargeback provision that complies with the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(f), and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.  

(c)
If any Shareholder that unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6) has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as of the end of any Taxable Year, computed after
the application of  Sections 4.3(a) and  4.3(b)  but before the application of any other provision of this Article IV,
then Profits for such Taxable Year shall be allocated to such Shareholder in proportion to, and to the extent of, such Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit. This  Section 4.3(c)  is intended to be a qualified income offset provision as described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.  

(d)
Profits and Losses described in  Section 3.3(b)(v)  shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the manner that the adjustments
to the Capital Accounts are required to be made pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( k ) and ( m ).  

(e)
The allocations set forth in  Section 4.3(a)-(d)  (the   Regulatory Allocations  ) are intended to comply
with certain requirements of Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2 of the Treasury Regulations. The Regulatory Allocations may not be
consistent with the manner in which the Shareholders intend to allocate Profit and Loss of the LLC or make LLC distributions.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IV, but subject to the Regulatory Allocations, income, gain,
deduction, and loss shall be reallocated among the Shareholders so as to eliminate the effect of the Regulatory Allocations and
thereby cause the respective Capital Accounts of the Shareholders to be in the amounts (or as close thereto as possible) they
would have been if Profit and Loss (and such other items of income, gain, deduction and loss) had been allocated without reference
to the Regulatory Allocations. In general, the Shareholders anticipate that this will be accomplished by specially allocating
other Profit and Loss (and such other items of income, gain, deduction and loss) among the Shareholders so that the net amount
of the Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each such Shareholder is zero. In addition, if in any Fiscal Year
or Fiscal Period there is a decrease in partnership Minimum Gain, or in partner nonrecourse debt Minimum Gain, and application
of the Minimum Gain chargeback requirements set forth in  Section   4.3(a)  or  Section 4.3(b)  would cause
a distortion in the economic arrangement among the Shareholders, the Shareholders may, if they do not expect that the LLC will
have sufficient other income to correct such distortion, request the Internal Revenue Service to waive either or both of such
Minimum Gain chargeback requirements. If such request is granted, this Agreement shall be applied in such instance as if it did
not contain such Minimum Gain chargeback requirement.

The income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the LLC will be allocated, for federal, state and local income tax purposes,
among the Shareholders in accordance with the allocation of such income, gains, losses, deductions and credits among the Shareholders
for computing their Capital Accounts; except that if any such allocation is not permitted by the Code or other applicable law,
the LLC s subsequent income, gains, losses, deductions and credits will be allocated among the Shareholders so as to reflect
as nearly as possible the allocation set forth herein in computing their Capital Accounts.  

(b)
Items of LLC taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the LLC shall
be allocated among the Shareholders in accordance with Code Section 704(c) so as to take account of any variation between the
adjusted basis of such property to the LLC for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value using any permitted method selected
by the Tax Matters Partner.  

(c)
If the Book Value of any LLC asset is adjusted pursuant to the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( e )
or ( f ) subsequent allocations of items of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall take
account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value in the same
manner as under Code Section 704(c) using any permitted method selected by Tax Matters Partner.  

(d)
Allocations of tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items related thereto shall be allocated to the Shareholders according
to their interests in such items as determined by the Managing Member taking into account the principles of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).  

(e)
Allocations pursuant to this  Section 4.4  are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect,
or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Shareholder s Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses, Distributions
or other LLC items pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.  

4.5
Offsetting Allocations.  If, and to the extent that, any Member is deemed to recognize any item of income, gain, deduction
or loss as a result of any transaction between such Member and the LLC pursuant to Sections 83, 482, or 7872 of the Code or any
similar provision now or hereafter in effect, the Managing Member shall use its reasonable best efforts to allocate any corresponding
Profit or Loss of the LLC to the Member who recognizes such item in order to reflect the Members  economic interest in the
LLC.  

4.6
Forfeiture of Unvested Shares.  In the event that a Person s unvested Shares are forfeited, the Capital Account balance
attributable to such unvested Shares shall be nulled and void, and the subscriber for the Shares shall not have any rights to
any Distributions, unless such Person is the Member.  

4.7
Indemnification and Reimbursement for Payments on Behalf of a Shareholder.  Except as otherwise provided in  Section 5.4
 and  6.1 ., if the LLC is required by law to make any payment to a Governmental Entity that is specifically attributable
to a Shareholder or a Shareholder s status as such (including, without limitation, federal withholding taxes, state personal
property taxes, and state unincorporated business taxes), then such Shareholder shall indemnify and contribute to the LLC in full
for the entire amount paid (including interest, penalties and related expenses). The Managing Member may offset Distributions
to which a Person is otherwise entitled under this Agreement against such Shareholder s obligation to indemnify the LLC
under this  Section 4.7 . A Shareholder s obligation to indemnify and make contributions to the LLC under this  Section
4.7  shall survive the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the LLC, and for purposes of this  Section
4.7 , the LLC shall be treated as continuing in existence. The LLC may pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may have
against each Shareholder under this  Section 4.7 , including instituting a lawsuit to collect such indemnification and contribution
with interest calculated at a rate equal to the Base Rate plus three percentage points per annum (but not in excess of the highest
rate per annum permitted by law).

or representatives shall be liable to the LLC or to any other Member for any act or omission performed or omitted by such Person
in good faith in its capacity as a Managing Member of the LLC or otherwise;  provided that , except as otherwise provided
herein, such limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent the act or omission was attributable to such Person s

either directly or by or through its Affiliates, agents or representatives, and the Managing Member shall not be responsible for
any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such Person appointed by the Managing Member (so long as such Person was selected

RIGHTS
AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE MEMBERS   

6.1
Limitation of Liability.  Except as otherwise provided by the Virginia Act, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the LLC,
whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be and remain solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the LLC,
and no Shareholder and no Member (including the Managing Member) shall be obligated personally for any such debt, obligation or
liability of the LLC solely by reason of being a Shareholder or acting as a Member or Managing Member of the LLC, other than such
Shareholder s obligation to make Capital Contributions to the LLC pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Shareholder s liability (in its capacity as such) for LLC liabilities and losses
shall be such Shareholder s share of the LLC s assets;  provided that  a Shareholder shall be required to return
to the LLC any Distribution made to it in clear and manifest accounting or similar error. The immediately preceding sentence shall
constitute a compromise to which all Shareholders have consented within the meaning of the Virginia Act. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the failure of the LLC to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of
its powers or management of its business and affairs under this Agreement or the Virginia Act shall not be grounds for imposing
personal liability on any of the Shareholders or Members (including the Managing Member) for liabilities of the LLC.  

6.2
Lack of Authority.  No Shareholder or Member (other than the Managing Member) in its capacity as such has the authority or
power to act for or on behalf of the LLC in any manner, to do any act that would be (or could be construed as) binding on the
LLC or to make any expenditures on behalf of the LLC, and the Shareholders and Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Managing
Member of the powers conferred on it by law and this Agreement.

Subject to  Section 4.7 , the LLC hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Person (each an   Indemnified
Person  ) to the fullest extent permitted under the Virginia Act, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended,
substituted or replaced (but, in the case of any such amendment, substitution or replacement only to the extent that such amendment,
substitution or replacement permits the LLC to provide broader indemnification rights than the LLC is providing immediately prior
to such amendment), against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorney fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person (or one or more of such Person s Affiliates) by reason of the fact that such
Person is or was a Shareholder or Member or a partner, member, employee, officer, director, agent or other representative of the
Managing member or is or was serving as a Managing Member, officer, director, principal, member, employee, agent or representative
of the LLC or is or was serving at the request of the LLC as a Managing Member, officer, director, principal, member, employee,
agent or representative of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise;
 provided that  (unless the Managing Member otherwise consents) no Indemnified Person shall be indemnified for any expenses,
liabilities and losses suffered to the extent attributable to such Indemnified Person s or its Affiliates  gross negligence,
willful misconduct or knowing violation of law or for any present or future breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants
by such Indemnified Person or its Affiliates, employees, agents or representatives contained herein or in any other agreement
with the LLC. Expenses, including attorneys  fees and expenses, incurred by any such Indemnified Person in defending a proceeding
shall be paid by the LLC in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by the LLC.  

(b)
The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in this  Section 6.4  shall not be exclusive of any
other right which any Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, law, vote of Managing Member or otherwise.  

(c)
The LLC may maintain insurance, at sole discretion of the Managing Member and at the LLC s expense, to protect any Indemnified
Person against any expense, liability or loss relating to the LLC or its business whether or not the LLC would have the power
to indemnify such Indemnified Person against such expense, liability or loss under the provisions of this  Section 6.4 .  

(d)
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including in this  Section 6.4 ), any indemnity by the LLC relating
to the matters covered in this  Section 6.4  shall be provided out of and to the extent of LLC assets only and neither the
Managing Member nor any other Shareholder (unless such Shareholder otherwise agrees in writing or is found in a final decision
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have personal liability on account thereof) shall have personal liability on account thereof
or shall be required to make additional Capital Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the LLC (except as expressly provided
herein).  

(e)

extent permitted by any applicable portion of this  Section 6.4  that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.

which shall not be unreasonably withheld) is required by this Agreement or by applicable law, the Members shall act through meetings
and written consents as described in this  Section 6.5 , and each holder of Shares shall be entitled to vote based on such
Shareholder s Proportional Share indicated in  Exhibit A, as amended . The actions by the Members permitted hereunder
may be taken at a meeting called by the Managing Member or Members holding at least 2/3 of all Shares then issued and outstanding
on at least 10 business days  prior written notice to all other Members, which notice shall state the purpose or purposes
for which such meeting is being called. The actions taken by the Members entitled to vote or consent at any meeting (as opposed
to by written consent), however called and noticed, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call
and notice if (but not until), either before, at or after the meeting, the Members entitled to vote or consent as to whom it was
improperly held signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.
The actions by the Members entitled to vote or consent may be taken by vote of the Members entitled to vote or consent at a meeting
or by written consent (without a meeting and without a vote) so long as such consent is signed by the Members having not less
than the minimum number of Shares that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members entitled
to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the action so taken without a meeting shall be given to those Members

this  Article IX  or (ii) with the prior written consent of the Managing Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. For the three-year period commencing from December 31, 2015, except: (i) pursuant to  Section 9.2 ,  9.4 
or  9.5 , (ii) in the case of Permitted Transfer, or (iii) in a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, no Member shall Transfer,
or offer or cause to Transfer, any legal or beneficial interest in any Shares without the prior written consent of the Managing
Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  

(b)
Except in connection with an Approved Sale, each Transferee of the Shares or other interest(s) in the LLC shall, as a condition
precedent to such Transfer, execute a counterpart to this Agreement pursuant to which such Transferee shall agree to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement.  

9.2
Exit Rights.  At any time after the date hereof:  

(a)
the Managing Member may cause an Approved Sale pursuant to the terms and conditions described in  Section 9.5 , which sale
shall be negotiated and executed by the Managing Member and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall require the unanimous vote of all
other Members; and  

(b)
each Member shall have the right to sell all or any portion of its Shares (including all rights and obligations associated with
such Shares) at any time to any Person subject only to  Sections 9.1(b)  and  9.4 .  

9.3
First Refusal Rights.   

(a)
Subject to compliance with all other provisions of this Agreement, prior to any Transfer of Shares (except in an Approved Sale
or a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee), the Member desiring to make such Transfer (the   Transferring Shareholder  )
shall deliver a written notice (the   Offer Notice  ) to the Managing Member, disclosing in reasonable detail
the identity of the prospective Transferee, the Shares to be Transferred (the   Offered Shares  ), and the terms
and conditions of the proposed Transfer. The Transferring Shareholder shall not consummate such proposed Transfer until the ROFR
Termination Date (as defined in  Section 9.3(c)  below), unless the parties to the Transfer have been finally determined
pursuant to this  Section 9.3  prior to the ROFR Termination Date or such Transfer of Shares is to a Permitted Transferee.  

(b)
The LLC may elect to purchase any or all of the Offered Shares on the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Notice, by delivering
written notice of such election, specifying the quantity of such Shares that the LLC proposes to acquire, to the Transferring
Shareholder and the Managing Member within Twenty (20) days after its receipt of the Offer Notice. If the LLC elects to purchase
less than all of the Offered Shares, the Managing Member may elect to purchase any or all of the Offered Shares not proposed within
such 20-business-day period and on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Notice, by delivering written notice of
such election to the LLC and the Transferring Shareholder.  

(c)
The purchase of the Offered Shares from the Transferring Shareholder by the LLC and/or the Managing Member shall be consummated
as soon as practicable after the delivery of the election notice(s) to the Transferring Shareholder, but in any event before the
ROFR Termination Date. If the LLC and the Managing Member have not elected to purchase all of the Offered Shares within 45 days,
or have not consummated such purchase within 60 days, after delivery of the Offer Notice (the earlier such date, the  ROFR
Termination Date ), the Transferring Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer the Offered Shares to the Transferee identified
in the Offer Notice on terms and conditions no more favorable to such Transferee than those specified in the Offer Notice; provided
that any Shares not transferred within 60 days following the ROFR Termination Date shall be subject to the provisions of this
 Section 9.3  upon subsequent Transfer. Transfer; and provided further that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Shareholder may Transfer any Shares to a Competitor of the LLC pursuant to this  Section 9.3 .  

9.4
Tag Along Rights.  At least 15 days prior to any Transfer of Shares (other than to a Permitted Transferee and other than Transfers
not to exceed three percent in the aggregate of the Shares issued to the Transferring Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement),
the Transferring Shareholder shall deliver a written notice (the   Sale Notice  ) to the LLC and to the other
Members holding the same class of Shares as proposed to be Transferred by such holder (the   Other Members  ),
specifying in reasonable detail the Shares to be Transferred and the terms and conditions of the Transfer. The Other Members may
elect to participate in the contemplated Transfer with respect to the same class of Shares proposed to be Transferred by such
holder of Power Fund Equity by delivering written notice to the Transferring Shareholder within 15 days after delivery of the
Sale Notice, and failure to deliver any such notice shall be deemed a waiver of rights under this  Section 9.4  with respect
to such Transfer. The aggregate consideration to be received by each Shareholder in such Transfer shall be based upon the Pro
Rata Share represented by the Shares requested to be included by each Shareholder relative to the Pro Rata Share of all Shares
participating in such Transfer held by the Shareholders participating in such Transfer. If no Other Member has elected to participate
in the contemplated Transfer (through notice to such effect or expiration of the 15-day period after delivery of the Sale Notice),
then the Transferring Shareholder may, during the 90-day period immediately following the date of the delivery of the Sale Notice,
Transfer the Shares specified in the Sale Notice at a price and on terms no more favorable to the Transferee(s) thereof than specified
in the Sale Notice. Any Shares identified in the Sale Notice but not Transferred within such 90-day period shall be subject to
the provisions of this  Section 9.4  upon subsequent Transfer.

for, consent to and raise no objections against such Approved Sale. If the Approved Sale is structured as a (x) merger or consolidation,
each Member holding Shares shall waive any dissenters rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with such merger
or consolidation or (y) sale of Shares, each holder of Shares shall agree to sell all of his, her or its Shares and rights to
acquire Shares on the terms and conditions approved by the Managing Member. Each Member holding Shares shall take all necessary
or desirable actions in connection with the consummation of the Approved Sale as requested by the Managing Member.  

(b)
The obligations of the Members holding Shares with respect to the Approved Sale are subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions: (i) the consideration payable upon consummation of such Approved Sale to all Shareholders shall be allocated among
the Shareholders as if distributed pursuant to  Section 4.1(b) ; and (ii) upon the consummation of the Approved Sale, all
of the Shareholders of a particular class of Shares shall receive the same amount of consideration per Share of such class (with
any non-cash consideration valued in good faith by the Managing Member), as reduced by the aggregate principal amount plus all
accrued and unpaid interest on any indebtedness of any holder to the LLC.  

(c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in connection with an Approved Sale, (i) no Shareholder will be required to make affirmative
representations or warranties except as to such Shareholder s due power and authority, non-contravention and ownership of
Shares, free and clear of all liens, and (ii) the Shareholders may be severally obligated to join on a pro rata basis (based on
the amount by which each holder s share of the aggregate proceeds paid with respect to its Shares would have been reduced
had the aggregate proceeds available for distribution to such Shareholders been reduced by the amount of such indemnity) in any
indemnification obligation agreed to by the Managing Member in connection with such Approved Sale, except that each Member may
be fully liable for obligations that relate specifically to such Shareholder, such as indemnification with respect to representations
and warranties given by such Shareholder regarding such Shareholder s title to and ownership of Shares;  provided 
that no holder shall be obligated in connection with such Approved Sale to agree to indemnify or hold harmless the Transferees
with respect to an amount in excess of the cash proceeds to which such holder is entitled in such Approved Sale, or to make indemnity
payments in excess of the net cash proceeds paid to such holder in connection with such Approved Sale;  provided further ,
that any escrow of proceeds of any such transaction shall be withheld on a pro rata basis among all Shareholders (based on the
amount by which each such holder s share of the aggregate proceeds otherwise payable with respect to its Shares would have
been reduced had the aggregate proceeds available for distribution to such Shareholders been reduced by the amount placed in escrow).
Each Shareholder shall enter into any indemnification or contribution agreement requested by the Managing Member to ensure compliance
with this  Section 9.5(c)  and the provisions of this  Section 9.5(c)  shall be deemed complied with if the requirement
for several liability is addressed through such agreement, even if the purchase and sale agreement or merger agreement related
to the Approved Sale provides for joint and several liability.  

(d)
Except as otherwise provided in  Section 9.5(d) , each Member Transferring Shares pursuant to this  Section 9.5  shall
pay its Pro Rata Share of the expenses incurred by the Members in connection with such Transfer (including by reducing the portion
of the consideration to which such Shareholder would be entitled in such Approved Sale).  

(e)
In addition, if the Managing Member approves a Public Offering or transaction pursuant to  Section 3.10 , each Shareholder
shall, and shall cause its affiliates and representatives to, vote for, consent to (to the extent it has any voting or consenting
rights) and raise no objections against any such transaction, and the LLC, the Managing Member and each Shareholder shall take
all reasonable actions in connection with the consummation of any such transaction as requested by the Managing Member.  

9.6
Void Transfers.  Any Transfer by any Member of any Shares or other interest in the LLC in contravention of this Agreement in
any respect (including, without limitation, the failure of the Transferee to execute a counterpart in accordance with  Section
9.1(b) ) or which would cause the LLC to not be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be void
and ineffectual and shall not bind or be recognized by the LLC or any other party. No purported assignee shall have any right
to any profits, losses or distributions of the LLC.  

9.7
Effect of Assignment.   

(a)
Any Member who shall assign any Shares or other interest in the LLC shall cease to be a Member of the LLC with respect to such
Shares or other interest and shall no longer have any rights or privileges of a Member with respect to such Shares or other interest.  

(b)
Any Person who acquires in any manner whatsoever any Shares or other interest in the LLC, irrespective of whether such Person
has accepted and adopted in writing the terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall be deemed by the acceptance of the benefits
of the acquisition thereof to have agreed to be subject to and bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
any predecessor in such Shares or other interest in the LLC of such Person was subject to or by which such predecessor was bound.  

9.8
Additional Restrictions on Transfer.   

(a)
Prior to any Transfer of Restricted Shares, the Member proposing to Transfer such Restricted Shares will deliver written notice
to the LLC describing in reasonable detail the Transfer or proposed Transfer. In addition, if the Member holding such Restricted
Shares delivers to the LLC an opinion of counsel (who may be counsel for the LLC), satisfactory in form and substance to the Managing
Member and counsel for the LLC (which opinion may be waived, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Managing Member) that
no subsequent Transfer of such Restricted Shares will require registration under the Securities Act, the LLC will promptly upon
such contemplated Transfer deliver new certificates or instruments, as the case may be, for such Restricted Shares which do not
bear the restrictive legend relating to the Securities Act as set forth below. If the LLC is not required to deliver new certificates
or instruments, as the case may be, for such Restricted Shares not bearing such legend, the Member holding such Restricted Shares
will not Transfer the same until the prospective Transferee has confirmed to the LLC in writing its agreement to be bound by the
conditions contained in this  Section 9.8 .  

(b)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this  Article IX , no Transfer of Shares or any other interest in the LLC may be
made unless in the opinion of counsel for the LLC, satisfactory in form and substance to the Managing Member and counsel for the
LLC (which opinion may be waived, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Managing Member), such Transfer would not violate
any federal securities laws or any state or provincial securities or  blue sky  laws (including any investor suitability
standards) applicable to the LLC or the interest to be Transferred, or cause the LLC to be required to register its securities
under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or register as an  Investment Company  under the U.S. Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. Such opinion of counsel shall be delivered in writing to the LLC prior to the date of the Transfer.  

(c)
In order to permit the LLC to qualify for the benefit of a  safe harbor  under Code Section 7704, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Transfer of any Share or economic interest shall be permitted or recognized by
the LLC or the Managing Member (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(d)) if and to the extent that such
Transfer would cause the LLC to have more than 100 partners (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h), including
the look-through rule in Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)).  

9.9

OR STATE ACTS OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER. THE TRANSFER OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT
TO THE CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2005, AS AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM
TIME TO TIME, GOVERNING THE ISSUER (THE  COMPANY ) AND BY AND AMONG CERTAIN INVESTORS. A COPY OF SUCH CONDITIONS SHALL

by this Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated hereby. Upon a Transfer of all of a Member s Shares in a Transfer
permitted by this Agreement, subject to the provisions of  Section 9.7 , such Member shall cease to be a Member. Notwithstanding
that payment on account of a withdrawal may be made after the effective time of such withdrawal, any completely withdrawing Member
will not be considered a Member for any purpose after the effective time of such complete withdrawal, and, in the case of a partial
withdrawal, such Shareholder s Capital Account (and corresponding voting and other rights) shall be reduced for all other

ARTICLE

DISSOLUTION
AND LIQUIDATION   

12.1
Dissolution.  The LLC shall not be dissolved by the admission of Additional Members or Substituted Members. The LLC shall dissolve,
and its affairs shall be wound up upon the first to occur of the following:  

(a)
at any time by the Managing Member; or  

(b)
the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the LLC under the Virginia Act or an administrative dissolution under the Virginia
Act.  

Except
as otherwise set forth in this  Article XII , the LLC is intended to have perpetual existence. An Event of Withdrawal shall
not cause a dissolution of the LLC and the LLC shall continue in existence subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  

12.2
Liquidation and Termination.  On the dissolution of the LLC, the Managing Member shall act as liquidator or may appoint one
or more representatives, Members or other Persons as liquidator(s). The liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs
of the LLC and make final distributions as provided herein and in the Virginia Act. The costs of liquidation shall be borne as
an LLC expense. Until final distribution, the liquidators shall continue to operate the LLC properties with all of the power and
authority of the Managing Member. The steps to be accomplished by the liquidators are as follows:  

(a)
the liquidators shall pay, satisfy or discharge from LLC funds all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the LLC (including,
without limitation, all expenses incurred in liquidation) or otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof
(including, without limitation, the establishment of a cash fund for contingent liabilities in such amount and for such term as
the liquidators may reasonably determine);  

(b)
as promptly as practicable after dissolution, the liquidators shall (i) determine the Fair Market Value (the   Liquidation
FMV  ) of the LLC s remaining assets (the   Liquidation Assets  ) in accordance with the definition
thereof in this Agreement, (ii) determine the amounts to be distributed to each Shareholder in accordance with  Section 4.1(b) ,
and (iii) deliver to each Shareholder a statement (the   Liquidation Statement  ) setting forth the Liquidation
FMV and the amounts and recipients of such Distributions;  

(c)
if the Members do not deliver written notice to the liquidators disagreeing with the calculations in the Liquidation Statement
(a   Statement of Disagreement  ) within Fifteen (15) business days after the date of delivery of the Liquidation
Statement, absent manifest error, the Liquidation Statement shall be final and binding on all Shareholders. In the event such
holders give a Statement of Disagreement within such 15-day period, the holders of a majority of the voting Shares and the liquidators
will attempt in good faith to agree on the Liquidation FMV, and any such agreement shall be final and binding on all Shareholders.
If such Persons are unable to reach such agreement within Twenty (20) business days after the date of the Statement of Disagreement,
the holders of a majority of the voting Shares and the liquidators shall each, within 10 days thereafter, select an investment
banker or other appraiser with experience in analyzing and making determinations concerning matters in the Business and in valuing
entities similar to the LLC (including calculating distribution mechanisms like that set forth in  Section 4.1(b)  above),
and the two investment bankers/appraisers so selected shall together select a third such investment banker/appraiser similarly
qualified. The three investment bankers/appraisers so selected shall each determine the Liquidation FMV in accordance with the
definition thereof in this Agreement, shall determine the amount and allocation of Distributions in accordance with  Section
4.1 (b) , and shall, within 30 days after their retention, provide the written results of such determination to the Members
and the liquidators. For purposes hereof, the Liquidation FMV and the amounts to be distributed with respect to each class of
Shares shall each be equal to the average of the two appraisals closest to each other with respect thereto, and such amounts shall
be final and binding on all Shareholders. The costs of such appraisal shall be borne by the LLC; and  

(d)
as soon as the Liquidation FMV and the proper amounts of Distributions have been determined in accordance with  Section 12.2(c)
 above, the liquidators shall promptly distribute the LLC s Liquidation Assets to the holders of Shares in accordance
with  Section 4.1(b)  above. Any non-cash Liquidation Assets will first be written up or down to their Fair Market Value,
thus creating Profit or Loss (if any), which shall be allocated in accordance with  Sections 4.2  and  4.3 . In making
such distributions, the liquidators shall allocate each type of Liquidation Assets (i.e., cash or cash equivalents, etc.) among
the Shareholders ratably based upon the aggregate amounts to be distributed with respect to the Shares held by each such holder.
To the extent that equity securities of any Subsidiary of the LLC are distributed to any Shareholders in connection with the liquidation,
such Shareholders hereby agree to enter into a securityholders agreement with such Subsidiary and each other Shareholder which
contains restrictions on the Transfer of such equity security and other provisions (including with respect to the governance and
control of such Subsidiary) in form and substance similar to the provisions and restrictions set forth herein (including, without
limitation, in  Article IX  and  Article V ). The distribution of cash and/or property to a Shareholder in accordance
with the provisions of this  Section 12.2  constitutes a complete return to the Shareholder of its Capital Contributions
and a complete distribution to the Shareholder of its interest in the LLC and all the LLC s property and constitutes a compromise
to which all Shareholders have consented within the meaning of the Virginia Act. To the extent that a Shareholder returns funds
to the LLC, it has no claim against any other Shareholder for those funds.  

12.3
Cancellation of Certificate.  On completion of the distribution of LLC assets as provided herein, the LLC is terminated (and
the LLC shall not be terminated prior to such time) and the Managing Member (or such other Person or Persons as the Virginia Act
may require or permit) shall file a certificate attesting to the liquidation of the LLC with the Secretary of State of Virginia,
and any other filings made pursuant to this Agreement that are or should be canceled and take such other actions as may be necessary
to terminate the LLC. The LLC shall be deemed to continue in existence for all purposes of this Agreement until it is terminated
pursuant to this  Section 12.3 .  

12.4
Reasonable Time for Winding Up.  A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs
of the LLC and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to  Section 12.2  in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant
upon such winding up.  

12.5
Return of Capital.  Only the LLC, bit mot the liquidators, shall be liable for the return of Capital Contributions or any portion
thereof to the Shareholders (it being understood that any such return shall be made solely from LLC assets). For the avoidance
of doubt, any Member or liquidator shall not be personally liable for the return of Capital Contributions or any portion thereof
to the Shareholders. 

12.6
Hart-Scott-Rodino.  In the event the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the   HSR Act  )
is applicable to any Shareholder, the dissolution of the LLC shall not be consummated until such time as the applicable waiting
period (and extensions thereof) under the HSR Act have expired or otherwise been terminated with respect to each such Shareholder.

13.3
Amendments.  Subject to the right of the Managing Member to amend this Agreement as expressly provided herein, this Agreement
may be amended, modified, or waived with the written consent of a majority of the Power Fund Equity;  provided  that if any
such amendment, modification, or waiver would adversely affect in any material respect the rights, preferences or privileges of
any Shares as compared with the effect of such amendment, modification or waiver on the rights, preferences or privileges of the
Power Fund Equity, such amendment, modification, or waiver shall also require the written consent of the holders of a majority
of the Shares so adversely affected. In connection with any amendment, modification or waiver, or other approval hereunder, the
Managing Member will have no obligation to provide any information to any Person unless the consent of such Person is required
to be obtained in order to effectuate such amendment, modification or waiver;  provided  that any Person shall, at the request

of Shareholders  to reflect the admission of any other Member or Shareholder, the creation of issuance of any other Shares
or interests in the LLC or the making of any Capital Contributions.  

13.4

Agreement. All LLC assets shall be recorded as the property of the LLC on its books and records, irrespective of the name in which

any law. Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereby shall
be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any

any direct or indirect interest in LLC Profits, Losses, Distributions, capital or property other than as a secured creditor.  

13.13
Waiver.  No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or

At the request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall reexecute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted

THEREFORE , in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein and for the other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:  

1.
 Subscription For Securities  .  

(a)

by the Company after this Subscription Agreement has been executed and delivered by the Subscriber, and all conditions precedent
to the parties  obligations under this Subscription Agreement have been satisfied or waived, including the delivery by the

2.
 Transfer Restrictions  .  

(a)
 General  . The Subscriber represents that he/she/it understands that the sale or transfer of the Securities are restricted
and that:  

(i)
  No Registration  . The Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or the laws of any other jurisdiction
by reason of a specific exemption or exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state or international
securities laws, and that the Company s reliance on such exemptions is predicated on the accuracy and completeness of the
Subscriber s representations, warranties, acknowledgments and agreements herein. The Securities cannot be sold or transferred
by the Subscriber unless subsequently registered under applicable law or an exemption from registration is available. The Company
is not required to register the Securities or to make any exemption from registration available;  

(ii)
  Opinion  . The right to sell or transfer any of the Securities will be restricted as described in this Agreement which
include restrictions against sale or transfer in violation of applicable securities laws, the requirement that an opinion of counsel
be furnished that any proposed sale or transfer will not violate such laws and other restrictions and requirements;  

(iii)
  No Public Market  . There is no public market for the Securities and no assurance that such public market will ever
develop. Accordingly, the Subscriber may not be able to sell the Securities, and the Subscriber must be able to bear the economic
risk of the Subscriber s investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time.  

(b)
 Sale Requirements  . The Subscriber agrees that he/she/it will not offer to sell, sell or transfer the Securities or
any part thereof or interest therein without registration under the Securities Act and applicable state or international securities
laws or without providing to the Company an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Company that such offer, sale or transfer is
exempt from registration under the Securities Act and under applicable state or international securities laws or otherwise in
violation of this Subscription Agreement.  

(c)
 Legend  . The Subscriber acknowledges that the certificates representing the Securities, if issued by the Company, will
bear the following legend:  

THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE OR COUNTRY. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF WITHOUT AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE OR INTERNATIONAL
SECURITIES LAWS OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION.    

(d)
 Stop Order  . The Subscriber further acknowledges that the Company reserves the right to place a stop order against the
certificate representing the Securities and to refuse to effect any transfers thereof in the absence of an effective registration
statement with respect to the Securities or in the absence of an opinion of counsel to the Company that such transfer is exempt
from registration under the Securities Act and under applicable state or international securities laws.  

3.
 Subscriber Representations and Warranties as to Suitability Standards  . The Subscriber hereby represents and warrants
that:  

(a)
 Investment Decision and Experience  . The Subscriber and the Subscriber s advisors (which advisors do not include
the Company or its principals, representatives or counsel) have such knowledge and experience in legal, financial and business
matters as to be capable of utilizing the information made available by the Company to evaluate the merits and risks of and to
make an informed investment decision with respect to the proposed purchase, which represents a speculative investment. The Subscriber
is experienced in investments and business matters, has made investments of a speculative nature and has purchased securities
of United States companies in private placements in the past.  

(b)
 Own Account  . The Subscriber is acquiring the Securities for the Subscriber s own account, not on behalf of other
persons, and for investment purposes only and not with a view toward resale or distribution, transfer, assignment, resale or subdivision
of Securities. The Subscriber understands that, due to the restrictions referred to in  Section 2 , and the lack of any market
existing or to exist for the Securities, the Subscriber s investment in the Company will be highly illiquid and may have
to be held indefinitely;  

(c)
 Economic Risk  . The Subscriber can bear, and is willing to accept, the economic risk of losing the Subscriber s
entire investment in the Company and can bear such risk for an indefinite period of time;  

(d)
 Subscriber s Commitments  . The Subscriber s overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable
is not disproportionate to the Subscriber s net worth, the Subscriber s investment in the Securities will not cause
such overall commitment to become excessive, and the investment is suitable for the Subscriber when viewed in light of the Subscriber s
other securities holdings and the Subscriber s financial situation and needs;  

(e)
 Adequate Means  . The Subscriber has adequate means of providing for the Subscriber s current needs and personal
contingencies;  

(f)
 Risk Factors  . The Subscriber recognizes that any investment in the Company involves substantial risk, and the Subscriber
has evaluated and fully understands all risks in the Subscriber s decision to purchase Securities hereunder, including,
without limitation, the Risk Factors disclosed in the Offering Documents;  

(g)  No Review  .
The Subscriber understands that the offer and sale of the Securities have not been submitted to, reviewed by, nor have the merits
of this investment been endorsed or approved by any state or federal agency, commission, authority or self-regulatory organization; 

(h)
 Individual Subscriber  . If the Subscriber is an individual, the Subscriber is at least 18 years of age and a bona fide
resident and domiciliary (not a temporary or transient resident) of the state or country indicated on the signature page hereof
and the Subscriber has no present intention of becoming a resident of any other state or jurisdiction;  

(i)
 Non-Individual Subscriber  . If the Subscriber is not an individual, the Subscriber is domiciled in the state or country
indicated on the signature page hereof, has no present intention of becoming domiciled in any other state or jurisdiction and
is an  Institutional Investor  as defined under the  Blue Sky  or securities laws or regulations of the
