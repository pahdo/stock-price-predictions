1) Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared without audit. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring accruals and elimination of intercompany balances and transactions) necessary to present fairly
the financial position of Bed Bath   Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of August 27, 2016 and February
27, 2016 and the results of its operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended August 27, 2016 and August
29, 2015, respectively, and its cash flows for the six months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
are presented in accordance with the requirements for Form 10-Q and consequently do not include all the disclosures normally required
by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Reference should be made to Bed Bath   Beyond Inc.'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 27, 2016 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company's
significant accounting policies, and to subsequently filed Forms 8-K. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the fiscal 2015 consolidated
balance sheet to conform to the fiscal 2016 consolidated balance sheet presentation. 

The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments:
North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings,
does not meet the quantitative thresholds under GAAP and therefore is not a reportable segment. Net sales outside of the U.S. were
not material for the three and six months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015. 

The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise
and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles.
Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings,
consumables and certain juvenile products. Sales of domestics merchandise and home furnishings accounted for approximately 38.9%
and 61.1% of net sales, respectively, for the three months ended August 27, 2016 and approximately 39.4% and 60.6% of net sales,
respectively, for the three months ended August 29, 2015. Sales of domestics merchandise and home furnishings accounted for approximately
37.7% and 62.3% of net sales, respectively, for the six months ended August 27, 2016 and approximately 38.1% and 61.9% of net sales,
respectively, for the six months ended August 29, 2015. As the Company operates in the retail industry, its results of operations
are affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending habits. 

2) Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This guidance requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt
discounts. Costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements may continue to be recorded as deferred assets. ASU 2015-03 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier
adoption permitted. ASU 2015-03 must be adopted retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The Company adopted this
guidance at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and reclassified debt issuance costs from other assets to long term
debt on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance and prior fiscal year reclassifications did not have a material impact
on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

3) Fair Value Measurements   

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e.,  the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches, including quoted market prices
and discounted cash flows. The hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes
the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources.
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a company s judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. In certain cases,
the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset or liability
must be classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The
fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: 

Level 1   Valuations based on quoted
prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices
that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree
of judgment. 

Level 2   Valuations based on quoted
prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar
instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active
markets. 

Level 3   Valuations based on inputs
that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

As of August 27, 2016, the Company s financial assets utilizing
Level 1 inputs include long term trading investment securities traded on active securities exchanges. The Company did not have
any financial assets utilizing Level 2 inputs. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs included long term investments in auction
rate securities consisting of preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds (See  Investment Securities,  Note
5).  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash
equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable, long term debt and certain other liabilities. The Company s investment
securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, which are stated at amortized cost, and auction rate securities, which
are stated at their approximate fair value. The book value of the financial instruments, excluding the Company s long term
debt, is representative of their fair values. The fair value of the Company s long term debt is approximately $1.480 billion,
which is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (i.e., Level 1 valuation), compared to the carrying
value of approximately $1.500 billion. 

4) Cash and Cash Equivalents   

Included in cash and cash equivalents are credit and debit card
receivables from banks, which typically settle within five business days, of $111.2 million and $89.4 million as of August 27,
2016 and February 27, 2016, respectively. 

5) Investment Securities   

The Company s investment securities as of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016
are as follows: 

Auction Rate Securities  

As of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016, the Company s
long term available-for-sale investment securities represented approximately $20.3 million par value of auction rate securities,
consisting of preferred shares of closed end municipal bond funds, less temporary valuation adjustments of approximately $0.7 million
and $0.5 million, respectively. Since these valuation adjustments are deemed to be temporary, they are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss, net of a related tax benefit, and did not affect the Company s net earnings. 

U.S. Treasury Securities  

As of August 27, 2016, the Company had no short term held-to-maturity
securities. As of February 27, 2016, the Company s short term held-to-maturity securities included approximately $86.2 million
of U.S. Treasury Bills with remaining maturities of less than one year. These securities are stated at their amortized cost which
approximates fair value, which is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (i.e., Level 1 valuation). 

Long Term Trading Investment Securities  

The Company s long term trading investment securities,
which are provided as investment options to the participants of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, are stated at fair
market value. The values of these trading investment securities included in the table above are approximately $63.1 million and
$51.5 million as of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016, respectively. 

6) Property and Equipment   

As of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016, included in property
and equipment, net is accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. 

7) Long Term Debt   

Senior Unsecured Notes  

On July 17, 2014, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal
amount of 3.749% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2024, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.915% senior unsecured
notes due August 1, 2034 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.165% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2044 (collectively,
the  Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. 

The Notes were issued under an indenture (the  Base Indenture ),
as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture (together, with the Base Indenture, the  Indenture ), which contains
various restrictive covenants, which are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Notes as of August 27, 2016. 

Revolving Credit Agreement  

On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a $250 million five
year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement ( Revolver ) with various lenders. During the six months
ended August 27, 2016, the Company did not have any borrowings under the Revolver. 

The Revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants
and also requires the Company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all covenants related to
the Revolver as of August 27, 2016. 

Deferred financing costs associated with the Notes and the Revolver
of approximately $10.1 million were capitalized. In the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, the deferred financing costs
are included in long term debt, net of amortization, for the Notes and are included in other assets, net of amortization, for the
Revolver. These deferred financing costs for the Notes and the Revolver are being amortized over the term of each of the Notes
and the term of the Revolver and such amortization is included in interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Interest expense related to the Notes and the Revolver, including the commitment fee and the amortization of deferred financing
costs, was approximately $18.1 million for the three months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 and $36.8 million for the
six months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015. 

Lines of Credit   

At August 27, 2016, the Company maintained two uncommitted lines
of credit of $100 million each, with expiration dates of August 31, 2016 and February 26, 2017, respectively. Subsequent to the
end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the line of credit that would have expired on August 31, 2016 was extended through August
30, 2017. These uncommitted lines of credit are currently and are expected to be used for letters of credit in the ordinary course
of business. During the first six months of fiscal 2016, the Company did not have any direct borrowings under the uncommitted lines
of credit. Although no assurances can be provided, the Company intends to renew both uncommitted lines of credit before the respective
expiration dates. 

8) Shareholders  Equity   

The Company has authorization to make repurchases from time to
time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rules and regulations. 

Between December 2004 and September 2015, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $11.950 billion of its shares of common
stock. The Company also acquires shares of its common stock to cover employee related taxes withheld on vested restricted stock
and performance stock unit awards. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares
of its common stock for a total cost of approximately $299.5 million, bringing the aggregate total of common stock repurchased
to approximately 187.4 million shares for a total cost of approximately $10.0 billion since the initial authorization in December 2004.
The Company has approximately $2.0 billion remaining of authorized share repurchases as of August 27, 2016. 

The Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends
of $0.125 per share in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2016, totaling $0.250 per share for the first six months ended
August 27, 2016. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, on September 21, 2016, the Company s Board of
Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close
of business on December 16, 2016. Future cash dividends on the Company s common stock are subject to the determination by
the Board of Directors based on an evaluation of the Company s, financial condition and requirements, business conditions
and other factors. 

9) Stock-Based Compensation    

The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards
using a fair value method and records such expense, net of estimated forfeitures, in its consolidated financial statements. Currently,
the Company s stock-based compensation relates to restricted stock awards, stock options and performance stock units. The
Company s restricted stock awards are considered nonvested share awards. 

Stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months
ended August 27, 2016 was approximately $16.8 million ($10.7 million after tax or $0.07 per diluted share) and approximately $37.6
million ($23.7 million after tax or $0.16 per diluted share), respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for the three and
six months ended August 29, 2015 was approximately $16.1 million ($10.0 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) and approximately
$33.9 million ($21.1 million after tax or $0.12 per diluted share), respectively. In addition, the amount of stock-based compensation
cost capitalized for the six months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 was approximately $1.1 million and $1.0 million,
respectively. 

Incentive Compensation Plans   

The Company currently grants awards under the Bed Bath  
Beyond 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2012 Plan ), which amended and restated the Bed Bath   Beyond 2004
Incentive Compensation Plan (the  2004 Plan ). The 2012 Plan includes an aggregate of 43.2 million common shares authorized
for issuance and the ability to grant incentive stock options. Outstanding awards that were covered by the 2004 Plan continue to
be in effect under the 2012 Plan. 

The 2012 Plan is a flexible compensation plan that enables the
Company to offer incentive compensation through stock options (whether nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options),
restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other stock based awards, including cash awards. Under
the 2012 Plan, grants are determined by the Compensation Committee for those awards granted to executive officers and by an appropriate
committee for all other awards granted. Awards of stock options and restricted stock generally vest in five equal annual installments
beginning one to three years from the date of grant. Awards of performance stock units generally vest over a period of four years
from the date of grant dependent on the Company s achievement of performance-based tests and subject, in general, to the
executive remaining in the Company s service on specified vesting dates. 

The Company generally issues new shares for stock option exercises,
restricted stock awards and vesting of performance stock units. 

Stock Options  

Stock option grants are issued at fair market value on the date
of grant and generally become exercisable in either three or five equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of
grant for options issued since May 10, 2010, and beginning one to three years from the date of grant for options issued prior to
May 10, 2010, in each case, subject, in general to the recipient remaining in the Company s service on specified vesting
dates. Option grants expire eight years after the date of grant. All option grants are nonqualified. As of August 27, 2016, unrecognized
compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company s stock options was $26.2 million, which is expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years. 

The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of the grant
using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. 

(1) Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. 

 (2) The expected life of stock options is estimated based
on historical experience. 

 (3) Expected volatility is based on the average of historical
and implied volatility. The historical volatility is determined by observing actual prices of the Company s stock over a
period commensurate with the expected life of the awards. The implied volatility represents the implied volatility of the Company s
call options, which are actively traded on multiple exchanges, had remaining maturities in excess of twelve months, had market
prices close to the exercise prices of the employee stock options and were measured on the stock option grant date. 

 (4) Based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest
rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. 

 (5) Expected dividend yield is estimated based on anticipated
dividend payouts. 

Changes in the Company s stock options for the six months
ended August 27, 2016 were as follows: 

The weighted average fair value for the stock options granted
during the first six months of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was $11.87 and $23.12, respectively. The weighted average remaining contractual
term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding as of August 27, 2016 was 4.6 years and $6.2 million, respectively.
The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value for options exercisable as of August 27, 2016
was 3.1 years and $6.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value for stock options exercised during the first six months
of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was $9.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively. 

Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options for the
first six months of fiscal 2016 were $20.3 million and the net associated income tax benefit was $4.2 million. 

Restricted Stock  

Restricted stock awards are issued and measured at fair market
value on the date of grant and generally become vested in five equal annual installments beginning one to three years from the
date of grant, subject, in general, to the recipient remaining in the Company s service on specified vesting dates. Vesting
of restricted stock awarded to certain of the Company s executives is dependent on the Company s achievement of a performance-based
test for the fiscal year of grant and, assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting, subject, in general, to
the executive remaining in the Company s service on specified vesting dates. The Company recognizes compensation expense
related to these awards based on the assumption that the performance-based test will be achieved. Vesting of restricted stock awarded
to the Company s other employees is based solely on time vesting. As of August 27, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense
related to the unvested portion of the Company s restricted stock awards was $154.6 million, which is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 4.5 years. 

Changes in the Company s restricted stock for the six months
ended August 27, 2016 were as follows: 

Performance Stock Units  

Performance stock units ( PSUs ) are issued and measured
at fair market value on the date of grant. Vesting of PSUs awarded to certain of the Company s executives is dependent on
the Company s achievement of a performance-based test during a one-year period from the date of grant and during a three-year
period from the date of grant and, assuming achievement of the performance-based test, time vesting over periods of up to four
years, subject, in general, to the executive remaining in the Company s service on specified vesting dates. Performance during
the one-year period will be based on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ( EBIT ) margin relative to a peer group of
the Company and performance during the three-year period will be based on Return on Invested Capital ( ROIC ) relative
to such peer group. The awards based on EBIT margin and ROIC range from a floor of zero to a cap of 150% of target achievement.
PSUs are converted into shares of common stock upon payment following vesting. Upon grant of the PSUs, the Company recognizes compensation
expense related to these awards based on the assumption that 100% of the target award will be achieved. The Company evaluates the
target assumption on a quarterly basis and adjusts compensation expense related to these awards, as appropriate. As of August 27,
2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company s performance stock units was $35.5
million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years. 

Changes in the Company s PSUs for the six months ended
August 27, 2016 were as follows: 

10) Earnings per Share   

The Company presents earnings per share on a basic and diluted
basis. Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding, including

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Overview   

Bed Bath   Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company )
is a retailer which operates under the names Bed Bath   Beyond ( BBB ), Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops
andThat! or andThat! (collectively,  CTS ), Harmon or Harmon Face Values (collectively,  Harmon ), buybuy
BABY ( Baby ) and World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus (collectively,  Cost Plus World Market ).
Customers can purchase products from the Company either in-store, online, with a mobile device or through a contact center. The
Company generally has the ability to have customer purchases picked up in-store or shipped direct to the customer from the Company s
distribution facilities, stores or vendors. In addition, the Company operates Of a Kind, an e-commerce website that features specially
commissioned, limited edition items from emerging fashion and home designers, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal
2015. The Company purchased One Kings Lane, an authority in home d cor and design offering a unique collection of select
home goods, designer and vintage items, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company also operates Linen Holdings, a provider
of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, healthcare
and other industries. Additionally, the Company is a partner in a joint venture which operates eight retail stores in Mexico under
the name Bed Bath   Beyond. 

The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments:
North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings,
does not meet the quantitative thresholds under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and therefore is not a reportable
segment. 

The Company sells a wide assortment of domestics merchandise
and home furnishings. Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles.
Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings,
consumables and certain juvenile products. 

The Company s strategy is
centered on its customer-centric culture and commitment to customer service, supported by significant investments to strengthen
the Company s foundation for future growth:  

To do more for and with its customers wherever, whenever and
however they wish to interact with the Company;    

To provide its customers a seamless and more personalized shopping
experience whether they interact with the Company in a store, through one of its contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone
or through social media; and    

To be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying
life stages that make a house a home, and to become the destination for customers  needs and wants as they express their
life interests and travel through their life stages; all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions
the Company offers.     

The Company s objective
is to be its customers  first choice for products and services in the categories offered, in the markets, channels and countries
in which the Company operates, as those customers express their life interests and travel through their various life stages. The
Company strives to accomplish this objective through excellent customer service, including new products, services and solutions,
and by offering an extensive breadth and depth of differentiated merchandise at the right value. The Company is also enhancing
its ability to achieve this objective through its ongoing commitment to a world class information technology system, comprehensive
analytics and targeted marketing and communications.  

Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, the Company,
along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions
including the housing market, unemployment levels and commodity prices; the overall macroeconomic environment and related changes
in the retailing environment; consumer preferences, spending habits and adoption of new technologies; unusual weather patterns
and natural disasters; competition from existing and potential competitors across all channels of distribution; potential supply
chain disruption; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs and other terms to support the Company s
plans for new stores; and the ability to assess and implement technologies in support of the Company s development of its
omnichannel capabilities. The Company cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which these factors could affect the Company s
operating results. 

The following represents an overview of the Company s financial performance
for the periods indicated: 

Comparable sales for the three months and six months ended August 27, 2016 decreased by approximately
1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, as compared to an increase of approximately 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively, for the three and six months
ended August 29, 2015. For the three and six months ended August 27, 2016, comparable sales consummated through customer facing
online websites and mobile applications increased in excess of 20% over the corresponding periods in the prior year, while comparable
sales consummated in-store declined in the low single-digit percentage range.   

Comparable sales include sales consummated through
all retail channels which have been operating for twelve full months following the opening period (typically four to six weeks).
The Company is an omnichannel retailer with capabilities that allow a customer to use more than one channel when making a purchase,
including in-store, online, with a mobile device or through a contact center, and have it fulfilled, in most cases, either through
in-store customer pickup or by direct shipment to the customer from one of the Company s distribution facilities, stores
or vendors. 

Sales consummated on a mobile device while physically
in a store location are recorded as customer facing online websites and mobile applications sales. Customer orders reserved online
and picked up in a store are recorded as in-store sales. In-store sales are reduced by sales originally consummated from customer
facing online websites and mobile applications and subsequently returned in-store. 

Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable
sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to
be closed, such store s sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. Of a Kind is excluded
from the comparable sales calculation for the three and six months ended August 27, 2016, and will be included commencing in the
third quarter of fiscal 2016. One Kings Lane is excluded from the comparable sales calculation for the three and six months ended
August 27, 2016, and will continue to be excluded until a point following the anniversary of the acquisition, after the currently
in process re-platforming of One King Lane s systems and integration of its support services have been in place for a period
of time such that there would be a meaningful comparison in One Kings Lane s sales over the prior period. Linen Holdings
is excluded from the comparable sales calculations and will continue to be excluded on an ongoing basis as it represents non-retail
activity. 

Capital expenditures for the six months ended August 27, 2016
and August 29, 2015 were $184.8 million and $160.8 million, respectively. In the first six months of fiscal 2016, capital expenditures
included expenditures for enhancements to the Company s digital, web and mobile capabilities, ongoing investments in data
analytics, expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in stores including a new POS
system, spending related to the new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas, investments in new stores, store relocations and
store refurbishments and other projects. The Company continues to review and prioritize its capital needs and remains committed
to making the required investments in its infrastructure to help position the Company for continued growth and success. 

Several of the Company s key initiatives include: continuing
to add new functionality and assortment to its selling websites, mobile sites and applications; improving customer data integration
and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to its customers; continuing to strengthen
and deepen its information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options
that will improve the Company s delivery capabilities and lower the Company s shipping costs. These and other investments
are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across the Company s physical
and digital shopping environments. 

During the six months ended August 27, 2016, the Company opened
a total of ten new stores and closed one store. The Company plans to continue to actively manage its real estate portfolio in order
to permit store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability and will renovate
or reposition stores within markets when appropriate. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company s newest distribution
facility in Lewisville, Texas opened for inbound freight, and the Company expects to begin shipping to customers from this facility
in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, including the stores opened through August 27, 2016, the Company expects
company-wide to open approximately 30 new stores, most of which are planned for new markets, and close approximately 15 stores.
Additionally, during fiscal 2016, the Company expects to continue to invest in technology related projects and new stores, store
relocations and store refurbishments. 

The Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends
of $0.125 per share in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2016, totaling $0.250 per share for the first six months ended
August 27, 2016. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, on September 21, 2016, the Company s Board of
Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share to be paid on January 17, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close
of business on December 16, 2016. The Company expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock in the future, subject
to the determination by the Board of Directors, based on an evaluation of the Company s, financial condition and requirements,
business conditions and other factors. 

During the three and six months ended August 27, 2016, the Company
repurchased approximately 2.7 million and 6.5 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of approximately
$121.3 million and $299.5 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended August 29, 2015, the Company repurchased
approximately 2.9 million and 8.2 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $193.9 million
and $579.3 million, respectively. The Company s share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including
business and market conditions. The Company reviews its alternatives with respect to its capital structure on an ongoing basis. 

Results of Operations   

Net Sales  

Net sales for the three months ended August 27, 2016 were $2.988
billion, a decrease of $7.2 million or approximately 0.2% compared with net sales of $2.995 billion for the corresponding quarter
last year, due to a decrease of approximately 1.2% in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1.0% in
non-comparable sales including new stores and One Kings Lane. 

Net sales for the six months ended August 27, 2016 were $5.726
billion, a decrease of $7.6 million or approximately 0.1% compared with net sales of $5.734 billion for the corresponding six months
last year, due to a decrease of approximately 0.9% in comparable sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 0.8% in
non-comparable sales including new stores and One Kings Lane. 

The decrease in comparable sales for the three and six months
ended August 27, 2016 was approximately 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, as compared to an increase of approximately 0.7% and 1.4%
for the three and six months ended August 29, 2015. The decrease in comparable sales for the three and six months ended August
27, 2016 was due to a decrease in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount. 

The Company s comparable sales metric considers sales consummated
through all retail channels   in-store, online, with a mobile device or through a contact center. Customers today may take
advantage of the Company s omnichannel environment by using more than one channel when making a purchase. The Company believes
an integrated experience must exist among these channels to provide a seamless customer experience. A few examples are: a customer
may be assisted by an in-store associate to create a wedding or baby registry, while the guests may ultimately purchase a gift
from the Company s websites; or, a customer may research a particular item, and read other customer reviews on the Company s
websites before visiting a store to consummate the actual purchase; or a customer may reserve an item online for in-store pick
up; or while in a store, a customer may make the purchase on a mobile device for in home delivery from either a distribution facility,
a store or directly from a vendor. In addition, the Company accepts returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the
purchase was consummated, therefore resulting in reducing store sales by sales originally consummated through customer facing online
websites and mobile applications. As the Company s retail operations are integrated and it cannot reasonably track the channel
in which the ultimate sale is initiated, the Company can however provide directional information on where the sale was consummated. 

For the three and six months ended August 27, 2016, comparable
sales consummated through customer facing online websites and mobile applications increased in excess of 20% over the corresponding
periods in the prior year, while comparable sales consummated in-store declined in the low single-digit percentage range. 

For the three and six months ended August 27, 2016, comparable
sales represented $2.874 billion and $5.524 billion of net sales, respectively. For the three and six months ended August 29, 2015,
comparable sales represented $2.898 billion and $5.547 billion of net sales, respectively. 

Sales of domestics merchandise and home furnishings for the Company
accounted for approximately 38.9% and 61.1% of net sales, respectively, for the three months ended August 27, 2016 and approximately
39.4% and 60.6% of net sales for the three months ended August 29, 2015. Sales of domestics merchandise and home furnishings for
the Company accounted for approximately 37.7% and 62.3% of net sales, respectively, for the six months ended August 27, 2016 and
approximately 38.1% and 61.9% of net sales for the six months ended August 29, 2015. 

Gross Profit  

Gross profit for the three months ended August 27, 2016 was $1.117
billion, or 37.4% of net sales, compared with $1.141 billion, or 38.1% of net sales, for the three months ended August 29, 2015.
The decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended August 27, 2016 was primarily attributed
to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense, resulting from an increase in redemptions
partially offset by a slight decrease in the average coupon amount. Also contributing to the decrease in gross profit margin as
a percentage of net sales, to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct to customer shipping expense, which reflects a reduced
free-shipping threshold at bedbathandbeyond.com, for the majority of the second quarter. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 12 basis points. 

Gross profit for the six months ended August 27, 2016 was $2.140
billion, or 37.4% of net sales, compared with $2.185 billion, or 38.1% of net sales, for the six months ended August 29, 2015.
The decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales for the six months ended August 27, 2016 was primarily attributed
to, in order of magnitude, a decrease in merchandise margin and an increase in coupon expense, resulting from an increase in redemptions
and an increase in the average coupon amount. Also contributing to the decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales,
to a lesser extent, was an increase in net direct to customer shipping expense. The inclusion of One Kings Lane did not have a
material effect on gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

SG A for the three months ended August 27, 2016 was $835.9
million, or 28.0% of net sales, compared with $790.8 million, or 26.4% of net sales, for the three months ended August 29, 2015.
The increase in SG A, as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll
and payroll related items (including salaries) and an increase in technology expenses and related depreciation. The inclusion of
One Kings Lane increased SG A, as a percentage of net sales, by approximately 16 basis points. 

SG A for the six months ended August 27, 2016 was $1.646
billion, or 28.8% of net sales, compared with $1.562 billion, or 27.2% of net sales, for the six months ended August 29, 2015.
The increase in SG A, as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to, in order of magnitude, an increase in payroll
and payroll related items (including salaries) and an increase in technology expenses and related depreciation. The inclusion of
One Kings Lane did not have a material effect on SG A, as a percentage of net sales. 

Operating Profit  

Operating profit for the three months ended August 27, 2016 was
$281.0 million, or 9.4% of net sales, compared with $350.2 million, or 11.7% of net sales, during the comparable period last year.
For the six months ended August 27, 2016, operating profit was $494.0 million, or 8.6% of net sales, compared with $623.5 million,
or 10.9% of net sales, during the comparable period last year. The changes in operating profit as a percentage of net sales were
the result of the changes in gross profit margin and SG A as a percentage of net sales as described above. 

The Company believes operating margin compression is likely to
continue in fiscal 2016 as a result of several items, including increases in, as a percentage of net sales, coupon expense, net
direct to customer shipping expense, investments in compensation and benefits, and technology-related expenses, including depreciation
related to the Company s ongoing investments, as well as the inclusion of One Kings Lane. In addition, the year-over-year
comparison of operating margin will be impacted by the non-recurring benefit related to the state audit settlement which occurred
in fiscal 2015. 

Interest Expense, net  

Interest expense, net for the
three months ended August 27, 2016 was $18.2 million compared to $25.1 million for the three months ended August 29, 2015. For
the three months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, interest expense, net primarily related to interest on the senior unsecured
notes issued in July 2014. In addition, approximately $5 million of the decrease in interest expense, net related to a favorable
change in the value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan investments. This increase in the value of the investments was
offset by a corresponding unfavorable change in SG A and resulted in no net impact to the consolidated statement of earnings.
Also included in the decrease in interest expense, net was a realized loss of $2 million incurred related to the tender of certain
auction rate securities in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.  

Interest expense, net for the
six months ended August 27, 2016 was $34.5 million compared to $45.0 million for the six months ended August 29, 2015. For the
six months ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, interest expense, net primarily related to interest on the senior unsecured
notes issued in July 2014. In addition, approximately $8 million of the decrease in interest expense, net related to a favorable
change in the value of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan investments. This increase in the value of the investments was
offset by a corresponding unfavorable change in SG A and resulted in no net impact to the consolidated statement of earnings.
Also included in the decrease in interest expense, net was a realized loss of $2 million incurred related to the tender of certain
auction rate securities in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.  

Income Taxes  

The effective tax rate for the three months ended August 27,
2016 was 36.3% compared with 38.0% for the three months ended August 29, 2015. The tax rate for the three months ended August 27,
2016 included net benefits of approximately $2.9 million and the tax rate for the three months ended August 29, 2015 included net
costs of approximately $0.8 million, due to discrete tax events occurring during these quarters. 

The effective tax rate for the six months ended August 27, 2016
was 36.9% compared with 37.7% for the six months ended August 29, 2015. The tax rates for the six months ended August 27, 2016
and August 29, 2015 included net benefits of approximately $3.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, due to discrete tax events
occurring during the first six months of fiscal 2016 and 2015. 

Potential volatility in the effective tax rate from quarter to
quarter may occur as the Company is required each quarter to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the
probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit. 

Net Earnings  

As a result of the factors described above, net earnings for
the three and six months ended August 27, 2016 were $167.3 million and $290.0 million, respectively, compared with $201.7 million
and $360.1 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods in fiscal 2015.

in part, upon the Company s ability to execute these and other key initiatives successfully. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The Company has been able to finance its operations, including
its growth, through internally generated funds. For fiscal 2016, the Company believes that it can continue to finance its operations,
including its growth, cash dividends, planned capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and share repurchases, through existing
and internally generated funds. In addition, if necessary, the Company could borrow under its revolving credit facility. Capital
expenditures for fiscal 2016 are planned to be approximately $400 million to $425 million, with a significant portion for technology
related projects, which includes enhancements to the Company s digital, web and mobile capabilities and the continued deployment
of new systems and equipment to the stores and other projects. The remainder of the spend would be for the new distribution facility,
new stores, store relocations and store refurbishments, and other projects. These planned capital expenditures are subject to the
timing and composition of the projects. In addition, the Company reviews its alternatives with respect to its capital structure
on an ongoing basis. 

Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015  

Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months
ended August 27, 2016 was $468.2 million, compared with $409.3 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2015. Year over year,
the Company experienced a decrease in cash used in the net components of working capital (primarily merchandise inventories and
accounts payable, partially offset by income taxes payable), partially offset by a decrease in net earnings as adjusted for non-cash
expenses (primarily deferred income taxes). 

Retail inventory, which includes inventory in the Company s
distribution facilities for direct to customer shipments, was approximately $2.9 billion, an increase of approximately 1.0% compared
to retail inventory as of August 29, 2015. The percentage increase was due in part to the growth in the inventory in the Company s
distribution facilities for direct to customer shipments. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended
August 27, 2016 was $113.6 million, compared with $50.8 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2015. For the six months

offset by $86.2 million of redemptions of investment securities. For the six months ended August 29, 2015, net cash used in investing
activities was primarily due to $160.8 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $110.0 million of redemptions of investment

August 27, 2016 was $296.6 million, compared with $561.1 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2015. The decrease in net

Available Information   

The Company makes available as soon as reasonably practicable
after filing with the SEC, free of charge, through its website, www.bedbathandbeyond.com, the Company s annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, electronically filed or
furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk    

The Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest
rates relates primarily to the Company s investment securities. The Company s market risks at August 27, 2016 are similar
to those disclosed in Item 7A of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. 

As of August 27, 2016, the Company s investments include
cash and cash equivalents of approximately $577.8 million and long term investments in auction rate securities of approximately
$19.6 million. Each of the Company s investments in cash and cash equivalents and long term investments both had a weighted
average interest rate of 0.15%. The book value of these investments is representative of their fair values. 

The Company s senior unsecured notes have fixed interest
rates and are not subject to interest rate risk. As of August 27, 2016, the fair value of the senior unsecured notes was $1.480
billion, which is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments compared to the carrying value of approximately
$1.500 billion. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

(a)     Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company s management, with the participation
of its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 240.13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of August 27, 2016 (the end
of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q). Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the
Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s current disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b)     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in the Company s internal
controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1. Legal Proceedings   

The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business, which the Company does not believe to be material to the Company s business or financial
condition. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors    

In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q,
carefully consider the factors discussed under  Risk Factors  in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition
and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks the Company faces. The Company s operations could also be affected
by additional factors that are not presently known to the Company or by factors that the Company currently considers immaterial
to its business. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use
of Proceeds   

The Company s purchases of its common stock during the
second quarter of fiscal 2016 were as follows: 

(1) Between December 2004 and September 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $11.950 billion of its shares of common stock. The Company has authorization to make repurchases from time to time in the open market or through other parameters approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to existing rules and regulations. Shares purchased indicated in this table also include shares withheld to cover employee related taxes on vested restricted shares and performance stock unit awards. 

 (2) Excludes brokerage commissions paid by the Company.
