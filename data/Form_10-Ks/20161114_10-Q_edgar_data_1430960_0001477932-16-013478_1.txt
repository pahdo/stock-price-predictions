AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         NOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)        Recent Accounting Pronouncements        Business Combinations   The new guidance on business combinations retains the underlying concepts of the previously issued standard in that the acquirer of a business is required to account for the business combination at fair value. As with previous guidance, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values are recorded as goodwill.     The new pronouncement results in some changes to the method of applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in a number of significant aspects. Under the new guidance, all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Prior to the adoption, in-process research and development costs were immediately expensed and acquisition costs were capitalized. Further, the new guidance generally requires restructuring charges associated with a business combination to be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date.      Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    The pronouncements define fair value, establish guidelines for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures regarding fair value measurements.       Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    The pronouncement requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on Financial Statements. The pronouncement does not change the accounting treatment for derivative instruments.       Variable Interest Entities and Transfers of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities    The pronouncement on transfers of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and removes the exception from applying variable interest entity accounting to qualifying special-purpose entities. The new guidance on variable interest entities requires an entity to perform an ongoing analysis to determine whether the entity s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. The pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.     Management does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the financial statements.            FLURIDA GROUP, INC.

The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations.      However, in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated significant sales revenue of $ 10,055,716. Electrolux and its subsidiaries are operated independently in various countries, the management assess that it is unlikely if Electrolux and its subsidiary discontinue the purchase in near future due to the Company secured a purchase order in next three years with Electrolux and its subsidiaries. In addition, the going concern may be mitigated due to the close relationship between the Company and it s suppliers.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had income taxes payable of $ 496,667.              Net Income (Loss)       For the reasons set forth above, we had a net income of $ 1,123,821 and $ 2,044,761 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.      Commitments and Contingencies      The Company's purchase is primarily from supplier, Chuzhou Fuda Mechanical   Electronics Co., Ltd ("ChuZhouFuDa"), which is related and managed by director Jianfeng Ding. Chuzhou Fuda is an appliance components and sub-assemblies manufacturer established on March 18, 2008. Chuzhou Fuda is located in Chuzhou City, Anhui Province, China. There was no written supply agreement signed between the Company and Chuzhou Fuda. However, Chuzhou Fuda committed to the Company for the quantity and quality of products the Company ordered.     On June 25, 2013, the Company signed a consignment inventory agreement with Electrolux Hungary S.p.A., which was effective in September 2013.      Foreign Currency Translation      The Company has determined the United States dollars to be its functional currency for Flurida Group USA and European Euro to be its functional currency in European business. Assets and liabilities were translated to U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate. Statement of operations amounts were translated to U.S. dollars using the average rate of each month during the year. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders' equity.      Liquidity and Capital Resources         ______________            *     Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities       **     Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities       ***     Total Debt / Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity.                The Company's overall working capital was increased in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 comparing to year ended December 31, 2015, due to the decrease of current liability, the Company's current ratio was also increased due to the decrease of liability as well.     The Electrolux agreements require the Company to supply the motors, ice makers, and other parts based on Electrolux's needs. The payment terms for Electrolux North America customers, which constitute more than 50% of our revenues, were changed from a consignment basis to FOB China port in early 2015. Therefore, we don't have inventory related Electrolux North America customers. The other businesses with Electrolux in Europe still are on a consignment basis.     The Company entered into a promissory note secured renewal business loan agreement in the principal amount of $ 6,000,000 with East West Bank located in El Monte, CA. And the maturity date of the Note is from July 10, 2014 to July 31, 2015. On September 25, 2015, the loan was extended from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. On October 4, 2016, the loan was extended from September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2017. The principal amount of the Note is decreased to $ 5,000,000. The maximum aggregate amount that may be outstanding under all sub-limits (items 1 through 4) shall be the lesser of $ 5,000,000 or 80% of eligible accounts receivable less than 90 days from invoice date and 50% of inventory. The loan is secured by all company inventories, account receivable, and other assets of the Company.      The Company may only draw up to:                     (3)    $5,000,000 on Clean Advance for up to maturity date of the line, and                (4)    $4,000,000 for FX [Foreign Exchange] pre settlement risk allowing the Company to purchase forward contracts to hedge against FX risk.          The remaining terms of the original loan are unchanged.      Interest accrued on amounts advanced shall be due and payable on the 25th day of each month commending with the first month after the date of advance. The outstanding principal balance of this note together with all accrued and unpaid interest and all other amount due hereunder, shall be due and payable on December 31, 2016. Nothing was outstanding on this loan at September 30, 2016.      The management will continue to focus on improving our current business on marketing, customer services and general administrative activities effectiveness. The Company will continue efforts at a R D center at our California location and R D expenses could increase in future years as we again start developing more new products. The primary function of the Company's Research and Development Center is to identify and research new knowledge about scientific and technological topics in order to develop valuable products, processes and services for our customers. The Company has continually developed the new products at our Center, including a new condenser motor; a twist flex icemaker; oven circulation fan and wire harnesses for ovens. We are currently working on the development of these new products at our Center, although we cannot predict when, if ever, we will launch these products.      Specifically, the management still believes that within the operating activities, the efforts of collecting accounts receivables and making payments of accounts payables still were the primary factors for the changes of cash flows in 2016 and will continue in later years.     The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 6,363,385 at September 30, 2016 and $ 5,981,390 working capital and $ 8,615,550 at December 31, 2015 and $ 4,546,538 of working capital.     The total debt of $ 6,599,733 for September 30, 2016 included total of $ 2,578,707 for Chu Zhou Fu Da, $ 1,934,896 for Fulu Finance Management Limited, $ 133,589 for US suppliers, $ 1,203 for salary and payroll tax payable, and $ 50,747 for all other account payable, $ 496,667 income tax liabilities, and $ 603,924 unearned revenue, and $ 800,000 loan from Bank.           Our independent auditor has indicated that our customer concentration may raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations. However, due to the close relationship between the Company and its supplier, Chuzhou Fu Da, which is closely related and directly managed by shareholder and director Jianfeng Ding, Further, as of September 30, 2016, the cash and cash equivalent balance was $ 6,363,385 and account receivable was $ 5,977,884, such that the management believes that the revenues will be generated and its cash flows will be maintained to cover its operational costs and the risk of going concern in long term is significantly low.        Interest Rate Risk      We do not have significant interest rate risk, as our debt obligations (i.e., notes payables to shareholders which can be converted to common stocks). The annual interest rate of notes payable is 8%, and the interest expense would be accrued if the notes were not converted to common shares, and the notes holders request the Company for repayment of principles plus the interest. Seven non-affiliated loan holders asked the Company for repayment of notes plus interest on July 1, 2008. All remaining loan holders converted their loans to common shares on July 15, 2008.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk       Not applicable.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. The Company's controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) at September 30, 2016 based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, at September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's last three-month period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
