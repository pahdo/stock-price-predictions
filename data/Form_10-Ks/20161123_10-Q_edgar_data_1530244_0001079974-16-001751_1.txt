NOTE 1  - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required to be included in a complete set of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN

The Company's unaudited interim financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property.  The officer of the Company provides office services without charge. At inception on March 2, 2011, the Company issued 8,000,000 common shares valued at par to our sole officer and director as a partial repayment for expenses paid on behalf of the company.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the CEO paid expenses on behalf of the Company in the amount of $6,000. As of September 30, 2016 the Company owed advances of $24,789, to Miguel Dotres, one of the officers of the Company. These advances are unsecured, carry no interest and are due on demand.

NOTE 4   SHARE EXCAHNGE AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

On March 3, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization ("Agreement" or the "Share Exchange") with The Waters Club Worldwide, Inc. WCW is a private company incorporated in Florida in 2014, with offices at 401 East Las Olas Blvd., Suite 1400, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301. At the closing of the Agreement (which is contingent upon the effectiveness of this post-effective amendment to our registration statement and a 80% reconfirmation vote under Rule 419 and other closing conditions), pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, 8,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share will be issued to WCW shareholders holding 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of WCW. Upon completion of the foregoing transactions, (i) WCW will become our wholly-owned subsidiary, (ii) WCW's common stockholders will acquire 82% of our issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for their shares of WCW Common Stock, and (iii) we will change our name to The Waters Club Worldwide, Inc. As of September 30 ,  2016 the Agreement with WCW has not closed and was further amended on October 28, 2016, see note 5.

NOTE 5   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On October 28, 2016, we amended the March 3, 2016 Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization ("Agreement" or the "Share Exchange") with The Waters Club Worldwide, Inc. (the "Amended Agreement"). WCW is a private company incorporated in Florida in 2014, with offices at 750 W Sunrise Blvd, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33311. At the closing of the Amended Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the Amended Agreement, 89,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share will be issued to WCW shareholders holding 100% of WCW's issued and outstanding common shares and 20,000,000 shares of our Preferred Stock will be issued to the WCW shareholders holding 100% of the WCW Preferred Stock.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Company is in its initial stages of development with no revenues or income and is subject to all the risks inherent in the creation of a new business.  Since the Company's principal activities to date have been limited to organizational activities and prospect development, it has no record of any revenue-producing operations.  Consequently, there is no operating history upon which to base an assumption that the Company will be able to achieve its business plans.

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

Our interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments.  Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used in operating activities was $0. Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include a net loss of $5,500 compared to a net loss of $6,860 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a charge of $5,500 for audit fees. We had a non-cash item in the amount of $6,000 due to related party for expenses paid on behalf of the Company.  The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a charge of $6,860 for audit fees.

Results of Operations

We have had no operating revenues, and have an accumulated deficit of $31,769. Our activities have been primarily financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions and related party advances.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, professional fees and filing expenses were $5,500, compared to $6,860 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Not Required

- 10 -

Item 4T.   Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rule 13-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on and as of the date of such evaluation, the aforementioned officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

The Company also maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and properly recorded. This system is continually reviewed and is augmented by written policies and procedures, the careful selection and training of qualified personnel and an internal audit program to monitor its effectiveness.

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls during the three months September 30, 2016  through the filing date of the quarterly Form 10-Q. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.  It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
