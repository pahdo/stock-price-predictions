  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Organization 
  We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in Delaware in 1996 and focused on the midstream segment of the crude oil and natural gas industry in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, primarily Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and in Wyoming and the Gulf of Mexico. We have a diverse portfolio of assets, including pipelines, offshore hub and junction platforms, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks. We are owned   100%   by our limited partners. Genesis Energy, LLC, our general partner, is a wholly-owned subsidiary. Our general partner has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. We conduct our operations and own our operating assets through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. We manage our businesses through the following   five   divisions that constitute our reportable segments: 
             
    Offshore pipeline transportation and processing of crude oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico; 
                
    Onshore pipeline transportation of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide (or "CO   2   "); 
                
    Refinery services involving processing of high sulfur (or  sour ) gas streams for refineries to remove the sulfur, and selling the related by-product, sodium hydrosulfide (or  NaHS , commonly pronounced "nash"); 
                
    Marine transportation to provide waterborne transportation of petroleum products and crude oil throughout North America; and 
                
    Supply and logistics services, which include terminaling, blending, storing, marketing and transporting crude oil and petroleum products and, on a smaller scale, CO   2   . 
     On July 24, 2015, we acquired the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its affiliates for approximately   $1.5 billion  , subject to certain adjustments.  That business includes interests in offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines and   six   offshore hub platforms that serve some of the most active drilling and development regions in the United States, including deepwater production fields in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.  That acquisition complements and substantially expands our existing offshore pipelines segment. 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include Genesis Energy, L.P. and its subsidiaries, including our general partner, Genesis Energy, LLC. 
  Our results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared by us without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, they reflect all adjustments (which consist solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial results for interim periods. Certain information and notes normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading when read in conjunction with the information contained in the periodic reports we file with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Except per unit amounts, or as noted within the context of each footnote disclosure, the dollar amounts presented in the tabular data within these footnote disclosures are stated in thousands of dollars. 
   
  2. Recent Accounting Developments 
  Recently Issued 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard provides a five-step analysis for transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The guidance permits the use of either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date of this standard to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also approved  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents   

early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the transition methods and the impact of the amended guidance on our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance modifying the accounting for inventory. Under this guidance, the measurement principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost or net realizable value. The guidance defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 in response to stakeholder feedback that restating prior periods to reflect adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination adds cost and complexity to financial reporting, but does not significantly improve the usefulness of information provided to users.  Under the new ASU, an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The ASU also requires that the acquirer present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted this guidance and it has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to improve the transparency and comparability among companies by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
   
  3. Acquisition and Divestiture    
  Acquisition 
  Enterprise Offshore 
    On   July 24, 2015  , we acquired the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its affiliates for approximately   $1.5 billion  , subject to certain adjustments. That business includes interests in offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines and   six   offshore hub platforms, including a   36%   interest in the Poseidon Oil Pipeline System, a   50%   interest in the Southeast Keathley Canyon Oil Pipeline System, and a   50%   interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System.  To finance that transaction, in July, we issued   10,350,000   common units in a public offering that generated proceeds of   $437.2 million   net of underwriter discounts and   $750.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   senior unsecured notes due   2022   that generated net proceeds of   $728.6 million   net of issuance discount and underwriting fees.  The remainder of that transaction was financed with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility.   
         We have reflected the financial results of the acquired business in our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment from the date of acquisition.  The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values.  Those fair values were developed by management with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm.  As of the third quarter of 2016, the purchase price allocation for this transaction has been finalized.  Our finalized purchase price allocation remains unchanged from what was disclosed in the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      
  Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of our acquired offshore pipeline transportation business since   July 24, 2015  , the closing date of the acquisition.  The following table presents selected financial information included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented:

     Table of Contents   

The table below presents selected unaudited pro forma financial information incorporating the historical results of our newly acquired offshore pipeline transportation assets. The pro forma financial information below has been prepared as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2014 and is based upon assumptions deemed appropriate by us and may not be indicative of actual results.  This pro forma information was prepared using historical financial data of the Enterprise offshore pipelines and services businesses and reflects certain estimates and assumptions made by our management. Our unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated financial results would have been had the Enterprise acquisition been completed on January 1, 2014.  

4. Inventories 
  The major components of inventories were as follows: 

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The market value of inventories were not below recorded cost as of   September 30, 2016   and were below recorded costs by approximately   $0.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015  ; therefore we reduced the value of inventory in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for this difference in 2015.

Asset Retirement Obligations 
    We record AROs in connection with legal requirements to perform specified retirement activities under contractual arrangements and/or governmental regulations. As a result of the Enterprise acquisition of the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. on   July 24, 2015  , we recorded AROs based on the fair value measurement assigned during the preliminary purchase price allocation. 
  The following table presents information regarding our AROs since   December 31, 2015  : 

Of the ARO balances disclosed above,   $5.2 million   and   $9.8 million   is included as current in "Accrued liabilities" on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The remainder of the ARO liability as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is included in "Other long-term liabilities" on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  With respect to our AROs, the following table presents our forecast of accretion expense for the periods indicated:  

Certain of our unconsolidated affiliates have AROs recorded at   September 30, 2016   relating to contractual agreements and regulatory requirements. These amounts are immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  6. Equity Investees  
  We account for our ownership in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. The price we pay to acquire an ownership interest in a company may exceed or be less than the underlying book value of the capital accounts we acquire. Such excess cost amounts are included within the carrying values of our equity investees. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unamortized excess cost amounts totaled   $402.1 million   and   $414.0 million  , respectively. We amortize the excess cost as a reduction in equity earnings in a manner similar to depreciation. 
  As part of our Enterprise acquisition, we increased our ownership interest in each of Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company ("CHOPS") and Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline Company, LLC ("SEKCO") from   50%   to   100%  . Consequently, these entities were reflected as equity investees until July 24, 2015, at which point they became fully consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries.   
  Also, as part of our Enterprise acquisition, our ownership interest in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, LLC ("Poseidon") increased from   28%   to   64%  . We also acquired a   50%   ownership interest in Deepwater Gateway, LLC and a   25.7%   interest in Neptune Pipeline Company, LLC. These additional interests are accounted for as equity investments from the acquisition date of July 24, 2015. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we purchased the remaining   50%   interest in Deepwater Gateway, LLC for approximately   $26.0 million   (including adjustments for working capital), so we now own   100%   of that entity. Consequently, we now consolidate Deepwater Gateway, LLC instead of accounting for our interest under the equity method.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The following table presents information included in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements related to our equity investees. 

The following tables present the unaudited balance sheet and income statement information (on a 100% basis) for Poseidon (which is our most significant equity investment): 

Poseidon's revolving credit facility 
  Borrowings under Poseidon s revolving credit facilities, which was amended and restated in February 2015, are primarily used to fund spending on capital projects.  The February 2015 credit facility is non-recourse to Poseidon s owners and secured by substantially all of Poseidon's assets. The February 2015 credit facility contains customary covenants such as restrictions on debt levels, liens, guarantees, mergers, sale of assets and distributions to owners. A breach of any of these covenants could result in acceleration of the maturity date of Poseidon s debt. Poseidon was in compliance with the terms of its credit agreement for all periods presented in these Unaudited Combined Financial Statements.

8. Debt 
  Our obligations under debt arrangements consisted of the following: 

(1) 
    In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements as a direct reduction of related debt liabilities with amortization of debt issuance costs reported as interest expense.  Under current U.S. GAAP standards, debt issuance costs are reported as deferred charges (i.e., as an asset).   This guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and is to be applied retrospectively upon adoption.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  Genesis adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement and senior unsecured notes indentures. 
  Senior Secured Credit Facility 
  In April 2016, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the committed amount under our revolving credit facility to   $1.7 billion   (from   $1.5 billion  ), with the ability to increase the committed amount by an additional   $300.0 million  , subject to lender consent and (ii) permanently relax the maximum consolidated leverage ratio to   5.5   to   1.0  . 
  The key terms for rates under our   $1.7 billion   senior secured credit facility, which are dependent on our leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), are as follows: 
     The applicable margin varies from   1.50%   to   2.75%   on Eurodollar borrowings and from   0.50%   to   1.75%   on   alternate base rate borrowings. 
     Letter of credit fees range from   1.50%   to   2.50%    
     The commitment fee on the unused committed amount will range from   0.250%   to   0.500%  . 
     The accordion feature is   $300.0 million  , giving us the ability to expand the size of the facility up to   $2.0 billion   for acquisitions or growth projects, subject to lender consent.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.2 billion   borrowed under our   $1.7 billion   credit facility, with   $48.0 million   of the borrowed amount designated as a loan under the inventory sublimit. Our credit agreement allows up to   $100.0 million   of the capacity to be used for letters of credit, of which   $6.0 million   was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Due to the revolving nature of loans under our credit facility, additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re-borrowings may be made until the maturity date. The total amount available for borrowings under our credit facility at   September 30, 2016   was   $527.0 million  . 
   
  9. Partners  Capital and Distributions 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding common units consisted of   117,939,221   Class A units and   39,997   Class B units. 
  On   July 27, 2016  , we issued   8,000,000   Class A common units in a public offering at a price of   $37.90   per unit.  We received the proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, of   $298.0 million   from that offering.

Distributions 
  We paid or will pay the following distributions in   2015   and   2016  : 

(1) This distribution will be paid to unitholders of record as of   October 28, 2016  . 
   
  10. Business Segment Information 
  We currently manage our businesses through   five   divisions that constitute our reportable segments: 
             
    Offshore Pipeline Transportation   offshore pipeline transportation and processing of crude oil and natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico; 
                
    Onshore Pipeline Transportation   transportation of crude oil, and to a lesser extent, CO   2   ;  
                
    Refinery Services   processing high sulfur (or  sour ) gas streams as part of refining operations to remove the sulfur and selling the related by-product, NaHS; 
                
    Marine Transportation   marine transportation to provide waterborne transportation of petroleum products and crude oil throughout North America; and 
                
    Supply and Logistics   terminaling, blending, storing, marketing and transporting crude oil and petroleum products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt, and other heavy refined products) and, on a smaller scale, CO   2   .  
     Substantially all of our revenues are derived from, and substantially all of our assets are located in, the United States. 
  We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges, such as depreciation and amortization), and segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable cash generated by our equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of our legacy stock appreciation rights plan and includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing leases.  
  Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes, where relevant, and capital investment.

Transactions with Unconsolidated Affiliates 
  Poseidon 
  As part of our Enterprise acquisition, we became the operator of Poseidon in the third quarter of 2015.  We provide management, administrative and pipeline operator services to Poseidon under an Operation and Management Agreement . Currently, that agreement renews automatically annually unless terminated by either party (as defined in the agreement). Our revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflect   $2.0 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, of fees we earned through the provision of services under that agreement.  
  Deepwater Gateway 
  Deepwater Gateway, LLC, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary in the first quarter of 2016, no longer constitutes a related party. 
   
  12. Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
  The following table provides information regarding the net changes in components of operating assets and liabilities. 

Payments of interest and commitment fees, net of amounts capitalized, were   $125.1 million   and   $56.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We capitalized interest of   $19.9 million   and   $11.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we had incurred liabilities for fixed and intangible asset additions totaling   $55.3 million   and   $50.2 million  , respectively, that had not been paid at the end of the   third   quarter, and, therefore, were not included in the caption  Payments to acquire fixed and intangible assets  under Cash Flows from Investing Activities in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.     
   
  13. Derivatives 
  Commodity Derivatives  
  We have exposure to commodity price changes related to our inventory and purchase commitments. We utilize derivative instruments (primarily futures and options contracts traded on the NYMEX) to hedge our exposure to commodity prices, primarily of crude oil, fuel oil and petroleum products. Our decision as to whether to designate derivative instruments as fair value hedges for accounting purposes relates to our expectations of the length of time we expect to have the commodity price exposure and our expectations as to whether the derivative contract will qualify as highly effective under accounting guidance in limiting our exposure to commodity price risk. Most of the petroleum products, including fuel oil that we supply, cannot be hedged with a high degree of effectiveness with derivative contracts available on the NYMEX; therefore, we do not designate derivative contracts utilized to limit our price risk related to these products as hedges for accounting purposes. Typically we utilize crude oil and other petroleum products futures and option contracts to limit our exposure to the effect of fluctuations in petroleum products prices on the future sale of our inventory or commitments to purchase petroleum products, and we recognize any changes in fair value of the derivative contracts as increases or decreases in our cost of sales. The recognition of changes in fair value of the derivative contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes can occur in reporting periods that do not coincide with the recognition of gain or loss on the actual transaction being hedged. Therefore we will, on occasion, report gains or losses in one period that will be partially offset by gains or losses in a future period when the hedged transaction is completed. 
  
   18 

     Table of Contents   
  GENESIS ENERGY, L.P. 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

We have designated certain crude oil futures contracts as hedges of crude oil inventory due to our expectation that these contracts will be highly effective in hedging our exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices during the period that we expect to hold that inventory.  We account for these derivative instruments as fair value hedges under the accounting guidance.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are used to offset related changes in the fair value of the hedged crude oil inventory.  Any hedge ineffectiveness in these fair value hedges and any amounts excluded from effectiveness testing are recorded as a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  In accordance with NYMEX requirements, we fund the margin associated with our loss positions on commodity derivative contracts traded on the NYMEX.  The amount of the margin is adjusted daily based on the fair value of the commodity contracts.  The margin requirements are intended to mitigate a party's exposure to market volatility and the associated contracting party risk.  We offset fair value amounts recorded for our NYMEX derivative contracts against margin funding as required by the NYMEX in Current Assets - Other in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding derivative commodity contracts that were entered into to economically hedge inventory or fixed price purchase commitments.  

Financial Statement Impacts 
  Unrealized gains are subtracted from net income and unrealized losses are added to net income in determining cash flows from operating activities. To the extent that we have fair value hedges outstanding, the offsetting change recorded in the fair value of inventory is also eliminated from net income in determining cash flows from operating activities. Changes in margin deposits necessary to fund unrealized losses also affect cash flows from operating activities.

    These derivative liabilities have been funded with margin deposits recorded in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets under Current Assets - Other. 
       
  Our accounting policy is to offset derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty when a master netting arrangement exists.  Accordingly, we also offset derivative assets and liabilities with amounts associated with cash margin.  Our exchange-traded derivatives are transacted through brokerage accounts and are subject to margin requirements as established by the respective exchange.  On a daily basis, our account equity (consisting of the sum of our cash balance and the fair value of our open derivatives) is compared to our initial margin requirement resulting in the payment or return of variation margin.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a net broker receivable of approximately   $3.6 million   (consisting of initial margin of   $4.2 million   and decreased by   $0.6 million   of variation margin).  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a net broker receivable of approximately   $5.5 million   (consisting of initial margin of   $4.4 million   increased by   $1.1 million   of variation margin).  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , none of our outstanding derivatives contained credit-risk related contingent features that would result in a material adverse impact to us upon any change in our credit ratings.

Effect on Operating Results    

14. Fair-Value Measurements 
  We classify financial assets and liabilities into the following three levels based on the inputs used to measure fair value:  
           (1) 
    Level 1 fair values are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;  
              (2) 
    Level 2 fair values are based on pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date; and  
              (3) 
    Level 3 fair values are based on unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.  
     As required by fair value accounting guidance, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.  
  The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .    

Our commodity derivatives include exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded options contracts. The fair value of these exchange-traded derivative contracts is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and is, therefore, included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  See    Note 13    for additional information on our derivative instruments. 
  Other Fair Value Measurements 
  We believe the debt outstanding under our credit facility approximates fair value as the stated rate of interest approximates current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable maturities. At   September 30, 2016   our senior unsecured notes had a carrying value of   $1.8 billion   and a fair value of   $1.9 billion  , compared to   $1.8 billion   and   $1.5 billion  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of the senior unsecured notes is determined based on trade information in the financial markets of our public debt and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. 
       
  Additionally, we recorded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our Enterprise acquisition as of the acquisition date of July 24, 2015. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) developed using company-specific information. See    Note 3    for further information associated with the values recorded in our Enterprise acquisition.   
  
   21 

     Table of Contents   
  GENESIS ENERGY, L.P. 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Additionally, the fair value measurements, using unobservable (Level 3) inputs, used in recording the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed of CHOPS and SEKCO (which we now own 100% interest in and consolidate given the respective 50% ownership interest acquired from Enterprise for each of these subsidiaries) as a result of our Enterprise acquisition were used to calculate the effects of the re-measurement of our pre-acquisition historical interest in CHOPS and SEKCO at fair value, based on accounting guidance involving step acquisitions as discussed in ASC 805-10-25. 
   
  15. Contingencies 
  We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. Policies and procedures are in place to aid in monitoring compliance and detecting and addressing releases of crude oil from our pipelines or other facilities; however, no assurance can be made that such environmental releases may not substantially affect our business. 
  We are subject to lawsuits in the normal course of business and examination by tax and other regulatory authorities. We do not expect such matters presently pending to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
   
  16. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information 
  Our   $1.8 billion   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes co-issued by Genesis Energy, L.P. and Genesis Energy Finance Corporation are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by all of Genesis Energy, L.P. s current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, except Genesis Free State Pipeline, LLC, Genesis NEJD Pipeline, LLC and certain other minor subsidiaries. Genesis NEJD Pipeline, LLC is   100%   owned by Genesis Energy, L.P., the parent company. The remaining non-guarantor subsidiaries are owned by Genesis Crude Oil, L.P., a guarantor subsidiary. Genesis Energy Finance Corporation has no independent assets or operations. See    Note 8    for additional information regarding our consolidated debt obligations.  
  The following is condensed consolidating financial information for Genesis Energy, L.P., the guarantor subsidiaries and the non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following information should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following information and such Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should also be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes, together with our discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Included in Management s Discussion and Analysis are the following sections:

    Forward Looking Statements 
     Overview 
  We reported net income attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of   $32.1 million  , or   $0.28   per common unit, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (   2016   Quarter ) compared to net income attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of   $363.2 million  , or   $3.38   per common unit, during the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (   2015   Quarter ). This decrease principally relates to the $335 million non-cash gain we recognized during the 2015 Quarter resulting from a step up in basis to fair value of our historical interests in certain of our equity investees (CHOPS and SEKCO) as a result of our acquiring the remaining interest in those equity investees when we completed our Enterprise acquisition in July 2015.  Exclusive of that 2015 non-cash gain, our net income attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $32.1 million for the 2016 Quarter would be compared to net income attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $28.0 million for the 2015 Quarter, representing an increase of $4.1 million or 15%. 
  That $4.1 million increase in our quarterly net income was principally due to contributions from the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets we acquired from Enterprise in   July 2015  .  Those contributions were partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from acquired and constructed assets (primarily related to the financing of the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets we acquired from Enterprise), an increase in depreciation expense for assets acquired or placed into service (including those offshore Gulf of Mexico assets) and decreases in contributions from segments other than our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment. 
  Cash flow from operating activities was   $124.7 million   for the 2016 Quarter compared to   $121.0 million   for the 2015 Quarter. 
  Available Cash before Reserves was   $95.0 million   for the   2016   Quarter, a decrease of   $1.3 million  , or   1%  , from the   2015   Quarter. See  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  below for additional information on Available Cash before Reserves and Segment Margin. 
  Segment Margin was   $141.3 million   for the   2016   Quarter, an increase of   $0.6 million  , or   0.4%  , from the   2015   Quarter.   
  The increases in our net income (exclusive of the $335 million non-cash gain in the 2015 Quarter as discussed above) and Segment Margin resulted primarily from increases attributable to our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment partially offset by smaller decreases in our other segments. 
  Our diversified, yet increasingly integrated, businesses continued to perform in the 2016 Quarter within an acceptable range in spite of the ongoing dislocations in the energy sector, uncertainties in capital markets and the midstream space, and specific challenges, at the margin, on certain of our operations.  Even if this challenging backdrop continues in future quarters, we would expect to see sequentially higher net income and Available Cash before Reserves due to a variety of factors, including increasing volumes out of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the end of certain refinery turnarounds, and the initiation of service, and the anticipated ramp up of volumes between now and the end of 2017, from some of our recent organic projects.  In the aggregate, we believe our commercial operations are relatively stable in this challenging environment and we believe we have a reasonably clear line of sight of volume growth over the next four to six quarters.  As a result, we feel comfortable that our financial results and condition will continue to strengthen in future periods. 
  Our primary objective continues to be to deliver the best value to our unitholders while never wavering from our commitment to safe and responsible operations.  A lot has changed, we recognize, in how the market apparently values unit prices for MLPs or other midstream entities over the last year and a half to two years.  Although the move to eliminate our IDRs almost six years ago and continuing to deliver double-digit growth in distributions on a year over year basis were rewarded historically, we believe the metrics demanded by the markets have changed during these recent tumultuous times.   
  
   31 

     Table of Contents   

We now believe the best way to promote unit price appreciation under current conditions is to exercise strong financial discipline designed primarily to maintain and enhance our financial flexibility across the business cycle.  Although we believe we would otherwise naturally restore our financial flexibility with cash flows from operations, we feel we can accelerate that process by issuing additional equity, lowering the future growth rate of quarterly distributions, or pursuing a combination of the two.   
    
  Consequently, on July 27, 2016, we closed a public offering of 8,000,000 common units generating net proceeds of approximately $298.0 million.  As a practical matter, we would have issued such additional equity a year ago at the time of closing our Enterprise acquisition had markets been stronger at that point.  This 2016 equity raise instantly improved our liquidity and credit metrics. 
    
  We believe our increased liquidity and even stronger balance sheet resulting from such actions should combine to give us the flexibility to continue to pursue acquisitions and/or organic projects that we feel are consistent with delivering long term value to all of our stakeholders.  We also believe that our improved credit profile will significantly lower the future costs of refinancing our public debt when certain tranches become due beginning in 2021 or callable beginning in 2017. 
  A more detailed discussion of our segment results and other costs is included below in  Results of Operations .       
  Distribution Increase 
  In   October 2016  , we declared our   forty-fifth   consecutive increase in our quarterly distribution to our common unitholders.  In   November 2016  , we will pay a distribution of   $0.70   per unit related to the 2016 Quarter. 
  July 2016 Public Offering of Common Units 
  On   July 27, 2016  , we issued   8,000,000   Class A common units in a public offering at a price of   $37.90   per unit. We received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, of    $298.0 million   from th  at offering.  We used those proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility to fund future activities. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Revenues and Costs and Expenses 
  Our revenues for the   2016   Quarter decreased   $112.3 million  , or   20%  , from the   2015   Quarter.  Additionally, our costs and expenses decreased   $122.7 million  , or   23%  , between the two periods.  
  A substantial majority of our revenues and costs are derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products through our Supply and Logistics Segment. The significant decrease in our revenues and costs between the two third quarter periods is primarily attributable to decreases in market prices for such purchases and sales.   In general, we do not expect fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas to materially affect our net income, Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin to the same extent they affect our revenues and costs.  We have limited our direct commodity price exposure through the broad use of fee based service contracts, back-to-back purchase and sale arrangements, and hedges.  As a result, changes in the price of oil would proportionately impact both our revenues and our costs, with a disproportionately smaller net impact on our Segment Margin.  The same correlation would be true in the case of higher crude oil and petroleum products prices.  
  As discussed throughout this document and throughout our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have some indirect exposure to certain changes in prices for oil and petroleum products, particularly if they are significant and extended.  We tend to experience more demand for certain of our services when prices increase significantly over extended periods of time, and we tend to experience less demand for certain of our services when prices decrease significantly over extended periods of time.  For additional information regarding certain of our indirect exposure to commodity prices, see our segment-by-segment analysis below and the section of our Annual Report entitled  Risks Related to Our Business .  
  Although prices of crude oil have partially recovered since December 31, 2015, prices were lower in the three and nine month periods ending on   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  .  The average closing prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") decreased   3%   to   $44.94   per barrel in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $46.43   per barrel in the   third   quarter of   2015  .   We would expect changes in crude oil prices to continue to proportionately affect our revenues and costs attributable to our purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products, producing minimal direct impact on Segment Margin from those operations. However, due to the indirect exposure to changes in prices discussed above and in the discussion surrounding our Supply and Logistics Segment, crude oil and petroleum product sales volumes decreased   28%   in the 2016 quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter.

We currently have two distinct, complementary types of operations-(i) our onshore-based refinery-centric crude oil and refined petroleum products transportation, supply and logistics, and handling operations, focusing predominantly on refinery-centric customers (as opposed to producers), and (ii) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, focusing on integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties. Refiners are the shippers of over 80% of the volumes transported on our onshore crude pipelines, and refiners contract for approximately 80% of the use of our inland barges, which are used primarily to transport intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between refining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are mostly integrated and large independent energy companies who have developed, and continue to explore for, numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil properties whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast, unlike the lighter crude oil and condensates produced from numerous onshore shale plays. Those large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically viable, in most cases, even in this lower commodity price environment. Given these facts, we do not expect changes in commodity prices to impact our net income, Available Cash before Reserves or Segment Margin in the same manner in which they impact our revenues and costs derived from the purchase and sale of crude oil and petroleum products.  
  Segment Margin 
  The contribution of each of our segments to total Segment Margin in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was as follows: 

We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges, such as depreciation and amortization), and segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable cash generated by our equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of our legacy stock appreciation rights plan and includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing leases. Our reconciliation of total Segment Margin to net income reflects that Segment Margin (as defined above) excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, non-cash gains and charges, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, certain non-cash items, the non-cash effects of our stock appreciation rights plan and unrealized gains and losses on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment 
  Operating results and volumetric data for our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment are presented below:    

(1) 
    Segment Margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes approximately $21 million and $65 million, respectively, of distributions received from our offshore pipeline joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Segment Margin for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes $22 million and $72 million, respectively, in similar distributions from our offshore pipeline joint ventures.  
              (2) 
    One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (GEL Offshore Pipeline, LLC, or "GOPL") owns our undivided interest in the Eugene Island pipeline system. 
              (3) 
    Our SEKCO pipeline was completed in June of 2014. Under the terms of SEKCO s transportation arrangements, its shippers commenced making minimum monthly payments at that time, even though they did not commence throughput of crude oil until January 2015.  Volumes reported for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for SEKCO reflect the gradual commencement of throughput beginning in January of 2015. Even though our SEKCO volumes flow through both SEKCO and Poseidon, we include those volumes only once in the table above. 
              (4) 
    Volumes are the product of our effective ownership interest through the year, including changes in ownership interest, multiplied by the relevant throughput over the given year.

Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the   2016   Quarter increased   $15.6 million  , or   22%  , from the   2015   Quarter. This increase is primarily due to our acquisition from Enterprise, which closed on July 24, 2015.  As a result of our Enterprise acquisition, we obtained interests in approximately 2,350 miles of offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines (including increasing our ownership interest in each of the Poseidon, SEKCO, and CHOPS pipelines) and six offshore hub platforms. The operating results of the offshore pipeline assets acquired from Enterprise continue to meet or exceed our expectations, with a net increase in volumes (compared to the third quarter of 2015) for the most significant of those offshore crude oil pipelines. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the   first nine months   of   2016   increased   $128.2 million  , or   106%  , from the   first nine months   of   2015  . This increase is primarily due to our acquisition from Enterprise, which closed on July 24, 2015.  As a result of our Enterprise acquisition, we obtained interests in approximately 2,350 miles of offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines (including increasing our ownership interest in each of the Poseidon, SEKCO, and CHOPS pipelines) and six offshore hub platforms.

  Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment 
  Operating results and volumetric data for our Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment are presented below:

     Table of Contents   

Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the   2016   Quarter decreased   $4.4 million  , or   29%  . Certain significant components and details of this change were as follows: 
             
    With respect to our onshore crude oil pipelines, tariff revenues decreased quarter to quarter principally due to a net decrease in throughput volumes of   72,888   barrels per day or   49%  .  This was primarily the result of decreased volumes on our Texas pipeline system, particularly delivery volumes to the Texas City refining market. We believe such lower volumes to historical customers will last indefinitely as those customers have made alternative arrangements as a result of our endeavors to expand, extend and repurpose our facilities into longer lived, higher value service.  In addition, our Louisiana system experienced lower volumes between the respective quarters, as a major refinery customer emerged from a turnaround during the 2016 Quarter.  As such, we anticipate a ramp up in such volumes during the fourth quarter.  Volume variances on our other onshore pipeline systems had a less significant impact on the decrease in tariff revenues between the respective quarters due to a mix of tariff rates amongst these systems and less significant decreases in volumes.  These factors, impacting both crude oil volumes and tariff revenues, resulted in a $3.8 million decrease in Segment Margin compared to the 2015 Quarter. 
                
    Although volumes on our Free State CO   2    pipeline system decreased   57,921   Mcf per day, or   40%  , in the   2016   Quarter as compared to the   2015   Quarter due to lower levels of tertiary crude oil activities in Mississippi, that decrease had a much smaller effect on the contributions to Segment Margin by that pipeline.  We provide transportation services on our Free State CO   2    pipeline system through an  incentive  tariff which results in the average rate per Mcf that we charge during any month decreases as our aggregate throughput for that month increases above specific thresholds.  As a result of this "incentive" tariff, fluctuations in volumes above a base level on our Free State CO   2    pipeline system have a limited impact on Segment Margin.   
     Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the   first nine months   of   2016   decreased   $5.3 million  , or   12%  . Certain significant components and details of this change were as follows: 
             
    With respect to our onshore crude oil pipelines, tariff revenues decreased by   $3.5 million   period to period principally due to a net decrease in throughput volumes of   36,169   barrels per day, or   26%  .  This was primarily the result of decreased volumes on our Texas pipeline system, particularly delivery volumes to the Texas City refining market. We believe such lower volumes to historical customers will last indefinitely as those customers have made alternative arrangements as a result of our endeavors to expand, extend and repurpose our facilities into longer lived, higher value service.  Volume variances on our other onshore pipeline systems had a less significant impact on the decrease in tariff revenues between the respective quarters due to a mix of tariff rates amongst these systems and less significant decreases in volumes.  These factors, when combined with lower sales of pipeline loss allowance volumes, resulted in a $4.6 million decrease in Segment Margin compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
                
    Although volumes on our Free State CO   2    pipeline system decreased   66,648   Mcf per day, or   40%  , in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the   first nine months   of   2015    due to lower levels of tertiary crude oil activities in Mississippi, that decrease had a much smaller effect on the contributions to Segment Margin by that pipeline.  We provide transportation services on our Free State CO   2    pipeline system through an  incentive  tariff which results in the average rate per Mcf that we charge during any month decreases as our aggregate throughput for that month increases above specific thresholds.  As a result of this "incentive" tariff, fluctuations in volumes above a base level on our Free State CO   2    pipeline system have a limited impact on Segment Margin.

Refinery Services Segment 
  Operating results for our Refinery Services Segment were as follows: 

(1) Source: IHS Chemical 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Refinery Services Segment Margin for the   2016   Quarter   decreased     $0.2 million  , or   1%  .  Certain significant components and details of this change were as follows: 
             
    NaHS revenues   increased     14%   due primarily to an increase in NaHS sales volumes.  This is principally related to an increase in sales volumes to our South American mining customers during the 2015 Quarter.  Sales volumes between quarters to customers in South America can fluctuate due to the timing of third party vessels available to transport bulk deliveries.  
                
    The pricing in our sales contracts for NaHS typically includes adjustments for fluctuations in commodity benchmarks (primarily caustic soda), freight, labor, energy costs and government indexes.  The frequency at which those adjustments are applied varies by contract, geographic region and supply point. The mix of NaHS sales volumes to which we are able to apply such adjustments may vary due to timing or other factors such as competitive pressures, which had a negative effect on margin realized from NaHS sales for the 2016 Quarter and partially offset the increase in NaHS sales volumes and revenues.  We expect those other factors to continue. 
                
    Caustic soda revenues decreased   13%   between the quarters primarily due to a reduction in our sales volumes. The impact on Segment Margin, compared to the 2015 Quarter, from these reduced caustic soda sales is approximately $1.0 million. 
                
    Average index prices for caustic soda   increased   to   $661   per DST in the   2016   Quarter compared to   $563   per DST during the   2015   Quarter. Those price movements affect the revenues and costs related to our sulfur removal services as well as our caustic soda sales activities.  Typically, changes in caustic soda prices do not materially affect Segment Margin attributable to our sulfur processing services because we usually pass those costs through to our NaHS sales customers. To the extent we are unable to pass these caustic soda price changes onto our customers, Segment Margin may be impacted.  Additionally, our bulk purchase and storage capabilities related to caustic soda allow us to somewhat mitigate the effects of changes in index prices for caustic soda on our operating costs.

  Refinery Services Segment Margin for the   first nine months   of   2016     increased     $1.5 million  , or   3%  .  Certain significant components and details of this change were as follows: 
             
    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we were able to realize more benefits from our favorable management of the purchasing (including economies of scale) and utilization of caustic soda in our (and our customers') operations and our logistics management capabilities, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The fluctuation in NaHS revenues and volumes had a minimal impact on Segment Margin. 
                
    Caustic soda revenues decreased   13%   primarily due to a reduction in our sales volumes.  Fluctuation in caustic soda revenues and volumes had a minimal impact on Segment Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
                
    Average index prices for caustic soda   increased   to   $618   per DST in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to   $576   per DST during the   first nine months   of   2015  . Those price movements affect the revenues and costs related to our sulfur removal services as well as our caustic soda sales activities. Typically, changes in caustic soda prices do not materially affect Segment Margin attributable to our sulfur processing services because the pricing in many of our sales contracts for NaHS typically includes adjustments for fluctuations in commodity benchmarks (primarily caustic soda), freight, labor, energy costs and government indexes.

     Marine Transportation Segment 
  Within our Marine Transportation Segment, we own a fleet of   82   barges (  73   inland and   9   offshore) with a combined transportation capacity of   2.9 million   barrels,   42   push/tow boats (  33   inland and   9   offshore), and a 330,000 barrel ocean going tanker, the M/T American Phoenix.  Operating results for our Marine Transportation Segment were as follows:    

(1)     Under certain of our marine contracts, we "rebill" our customers for a portion of our operating costs. 
  (2) Utilization rates are based on a 365 day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and dry-docking.

Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Marine Transportation Segment Margin for the   2016   Quarter   decreased     $9.9 million  , or   37%  , from the   2015   Quarter.  The decrease in Segment Margin is primarily due to a combination of lower utilization and lower day rates across our various marine asset classes, excepting the M/T American Phoenix which is under long term contract through September 2020.  In our offshore barge fleet, as a number of our units have come off longer term contracts, we have chosen to primarily place them in spot service or short-term (less than a year) service, as we believe the day rates currently being offered by the market are at, or approaching, cyclical lows.  In our inland fleet, we saw somewhat of a strengthening in utilization and stabilization in spot day rates towards the end of the quarter, especially in the black oil, or heavy, intermediate refined products trade, the trade to which we have almost exclusively committed our inland barges. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
    Marine Transportation Segment Margin for the   first nine months   of   2016     decreased     $25.8 million  , or   32%  , from the   first nine months   of   2015  .

  Supply and Logistics Segment 
  Our Supply and Logistics Segment is focused on utilizing our knowledge of the crude oil and petroleum markets to provide crude oil and natural gas producers, refiners and other customers with a full suite of services. Our Supply and Logistics Segment owns and/or leases trucks, terminals, gathering pipelines, railcars, and rail loading and unloading facilities.  It uses those assets, together with other modes of transportation owned by third parties and us, to service its customers and for its own account. These services include: 
             
    utilizing the fleet of trucks, trailers and railcars owned or leased by our Supply and Logistics Segment to transport products (primarily crude oil and petroleum products) for customers; 
                
    utilizing various modes of transportation owned by third parties and us to transport products (primarily crude oil and petroleum products) for our own account to take advantage of logistical opportunities primarily in the Gulf Coast states and waterways; 
                
    purchasing/selling and/or transporting crude oil from the wellhead to markets for ultimate use in refining; 
                
    supplying petroleum products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products) to wholesale markets; 
                
    purchasing products from refiners, transporting those products to one of our terminals and blending those products to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers and selling those products; 
                
    railcar loading and unloading activities at our crude-by-rail terminals; and 
                
    industrial gas activities, including wholesale marketing of CO   2    and processing of syngas through a joint venture. 
     We also use our terminal facilities to take advantage of contango market conditions, to gather and market crude oil, and to capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time for both crude oil and petroleum products. 
  Despite crude oil being considered a somewhat homogeneous commodity, many refiners are very particular about the quality of crude oil feedstock they process. Many U.S. refineries have distinct configurations and product slates that require crude oil with specific characteristics, such as gravity and sulfur content, among others. Refineries evaluate the costs to obtain, transport and process their preferred feedstocks. That particularity provides us with opportunities to help refineries in our areas of operation identify crude oil sources meeting their requirements and to purchase the crude oil and transport it to refineries for sale. The imbalances and inefficiencies relative to meeting refiners  requirements can provide opportunities for us to utilize our skills and assets to meet their demands. The pricing in the majority of our purchase contracts contains a market price component and a deduction to cover the cost of transporting the crude oil and to provide us with a margin. Contracts sometimes contain a grade differential which considers the composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different customers. Typically, the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade differentials. The margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and to capitalize on grade differentials. 
  In our petroleum products marketing operations, we supply primarily fuel oil, asphalt and other heavy refined products to wholesale markets. We also provide a service to refineries by purchasing  heavier  petroleum products that are the residual fuels from gasoline production, transporting them to one of our terminals and blending them to a quality that meets the requirements of our customers.

  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Segment Margin for our Supply and Logistics Segment decreased by   $0.6 million  , or   7%  , between the two   three   month periods.   
  The decrease in our Segment Margin between the two quarters is primarily due to lower demand for our services in our historical back-to-back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points.  We have found it difficult to compete with certain participants in the market who are willing to lose money on local gathering because they are attempting to minimize their losses from minimum volume or take-or-pay commitments they previously made in anticipation of new production that has not yet and is unlikely to come online. In addition, a portion of this decrease can be attributed to decreased rail volumes. While rail volumes were down compared to the 2015 Quarter, our results reflect the beginning of a ramp up as a major refinery customer supported by our Baton Rouge facilities emerged from a refinery turnaround during the 2016 Quarter and we expect this ramp up to continue into the fourth quarter.  These decreases were partially offset by the improved performance of our now right-sized heavy fuel oil business after reducing volumes and related infrastructure to match new market realities resulting from the general lightening of refineries' crude slates which has resulted in a better supply/demand balance between heavy refined bottoms and domestic coker and asphalt requirements. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Segment Margin for our Supply and Logistics Segment decreased by   $3.3 million  , or   11%  , between the   first nine months   of   2016   and the   first nine months   of   2015  .

Other Costs, Interest, and Income Taxes 
  General and administrative expenses   

  Total general and administrative expenses decreased   $15.6 million   and   $20.1 million   between the   three and nine   month periods primarily due to higher third party costs, primarily financing, legal and accounting, related to business development and growth activities (primarily related to third party costs incurred for business development activities surrounding the Enterprise acquisition as previously discussed) and employee related costs relating to our annual bonus program incurred during the 2015 periods.  
  Depreciation and amortization expense 

Total depreciation and amortization expense increased   $13.1 million   and   $60.3 million   between the   three and nine   month periods primarily as a result of acquiring assets and placing constructed assets' in service during calendar 2015 (including the offshore pipelines and services assets acquired as a result of our Enterprise acquisition) and 2016.  
  Interest expense, net 

Net interest expense   increased     $5.1 million   and   $37.9 million   between the   three and nine   month periods primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from acquired and constructed assets, primarily related to additional debt outstanding as a result of financing our Enterprise acquisition. In   July 2015  , we issued an additional   $750 million   of aggregate principal amount of   6.75%   senior unsecured notes to fund a portion of the purchase price for our Enterprise acquisition.  Capitalized interest costs increased   $2.8 million   and   $8.0 million   over the   three and nine   month periods due to our growth capital expenditures for projects still under construction when compared to the prior year period.

Income tax expense 
  A portion of our operations are owned by wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries that are taxable as corporations. As a result, a substantial portion of the income tax expense we record relates to the operations of those corporations, and will vary from period to period as a percentage of our income before taxes based on the percentage of our income or loss that is derived from those corporations. The balance of the income tax expense we record relates to state taxes imposed on our operations that are treated as income taxes under generally accepted accounting principles and foreign income taxes. 
  Other 
  Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $335 million non-cash gain we recognized during the 2015 Quarter resulting from a step up in basis to fair value of our historical interests in certain of our equity investees (CHOPS and SEKCO) as a result of our acquiring the remaining interest in those equity investees when we completed our Enterprise acquisition in July 2015. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  General 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $527.0 million   of remaining borrowing capacity under our   $1.7 billion   senior secured revolving credit facility. We anticipate that our future internally-generated funds and the funds available under our credit facility will allow us to meet our ordinary course capital needs. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, borrowing availability under our credit facility and the proceeds from issuances of equity and senior unsecured notes. 
  Our primary cash requirements consist of: 
             
    working capital, primarily inventories and trade receivables and payables; 
                
    routine operating expenses; 
                
    capital growth and maintenance projects; 
                
    acquisitions of assets or businesses; 
                
    payments related to servicing outstanding debt; and 
                
    quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders. 
       Capital Resources 
  Our ability to satisfy future capital needs will depend on our ability to raise substantial amounts of additional capital from time to time   including through equity and debt offerings (public and private), borrowings under our credit facility and other financing transactions and to implement our growth strategy successfully. No assurance can be made that we will be able to raise additional capital on satisfactory terms or implement our growth strategy successfully. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our long-term debt totaled   $3.0 billion  , consisting of   $1.2 billion   outstanding under our credit facility (including   $48.0 million   borrowed under the inventory sublimit tranche), a   $350.0 million   carrying amount of senior unsecured notes due on   February 15, 2021  , a   $400.0 million   carrying amount of senior unsecured notes due on   May 15, 2023  , a   $350.0 million   carrying amount of senior unsecured notes due on   June 15, 2024  , and a   $750.0 million   carrying amount of senior unsecured notes due   August 1, 2022  . 
  In April 2016, we amended our credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the committed amount under our revolving credit facility to $1.7 billion (from $1.5 billion), with the ability to increase the committed amount by an additional $300.0 million, subject to lender consent and (ii) permanently relax the maximum consolidated leverage ratio to 5.5 to 1.0.  
  On   July 27, 2016  , we issued   8,000,000   Class A common units in a public offering at a price of   $37.90   per unit.  We received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, of    $298.0 million   from that offering.  We used those proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility to fund future activities. 
  Equity Distribution Program and Shelf Registration Statements 
  We expect to issue additional equity and debt securities to assist us in meeting our future liquidity requirements, including those related to opportunistically acquiring assets and businesses and constructing new facilities.   
  In 2016, we implemented an equity distribution program that will allow us to consummate  at the market  offerings of common units from time to time through brokered transactions, which should help mitigate certain adverse consequences of underwritten offerings, including the downward pressure on the market price of our common units and the expensive fees and  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents   

other costs associated with such public offerings.  We entered into an equity distribution agreement with a group of banks who will act as sales agents or principals for up to $400.0 million of our common units, if and when we should elect to issue additional common units from time to time, although there are limits to the amount of our  at the market  offerings the market can absorb from time to time.  In connection with implementing our equity distribution program, we filed a universal shelf registration statement (our "EDP Shelf") with the SEC.  Our EDP Shelf allows us to issue up to $400.0 million of equity and debt securities, whether pursuant to our equity distribution program or otherwise. Our EDP Shelf will expire in August 2017.  We expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement before our EDP Shelf expires.  As of September 30, 2016, we have issued no additional units under this program. 
  We have another universal shelf registration statement (our "2015 Shelf") on file with the SEC. Our 2015 Shelf allows us to issue an unlimited amount of equity and debt securities in connection with certain types of public offerings. However, the receptiveness of the capital markets to an offering of equity and/or debt securities cannot be assured and may be negatively impacted by, among other things, our long-term business prospects and other factors beyond our control, including market conditions.  Our 2015 Shelf will expire in April 2018.  We expect to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement before our 2015 Shelf expires. 
  Cash Flows from Operations 
  We generally utilize the cash flows we generate from our operations to fund our distributions and working capital needs. Excess funds that are generated are used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and/or to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. Our operating cash flows can be impacted by changes in items of working capital, primarily variances in the carrying amount of inventory and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures. 
  We typically sell our crude oil in the same month in which we purchase it, so we do not need to rely on borrowings under our credit facility to pay for such crude oil purchases, other than inventory. During such periods, our accounts receivable and accounts payable generally move in tandem, as we make payments and receive payments for the purchase and sale of crude oil.  
  In our petroleum products activities, we buy products and typically either move those products to one of our storage facilities for further blending or sell those products within days of our purchase. The cash requirements for these activities can result in short term increases and decreases in our borrowings under our credit facility.  
  The storage of our inventory of crude oil and petroleum products can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities. In the month we pay for the stored oil or petroleum products, we borrow under our credit facility (or use cash on hand) to pay for the crude oil or petroleum products, utilizing a portion of our operating cash flows. Conversely, cash flow from operating activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil or petroleum products. Additionally, we may be required to deposit margin funds with the NYMEX when commodity prices increase as the value of the derivatives utilized to hedge the price risk in our inventory fluctuates. These deposits also impact our operating cash flows as we borrow under our credit facility (or use cash on hand) to fund the deposits.  
        See    Note 12    in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding changes in components of operating assets and liabilities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
  The increase in operating cash flow for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to increases in earnings, including net income before depreciation and amortization.  This primarily results from the contributions of the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets we acquired from Enterprise.  This increase was partially offset by increases in working capital needs.  As discussed above, changes in the cash requirements related to payment for petroleum products or collection of receivables from the sale of inventory impact the cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, changes in the market prices for crude oil and petroleum products can result in fluctuations in our working capital and, therefore, our operating cash flows between periods as the cost to acquire a barrel of oil or petroleum products will require more or less cash. Net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $228.4 million   compared to   $192.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Capital Expenditures and Distributions Paid to our Unitholders 
  We use cash primarily for our operating expenses, working capital needs, debt service, acquisition activities, organic growth projects, maintenance capital expenditures and distributions we pay to our unitholders. We finance maintenance capital expenditures and smaller organic growth projects and distributions primarily with cash generated by our operations. We have historically funded material growth capital projects (including acquisitions and organic growth projects) with borrowings under our credit facility, equity issuances and/or issuances of senior unsecured notes.

Capital Expenditures and Business and Asset Acquisitions 
  A summary of our expenditures for fixed assets, business and other asset acquisitions for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   is as follows  : 

(1) 
    Amount represents our purchase price for our Enterprise acquisition. 
              (2) 
    Amount represents our purchase price for our purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Deepwater Gateway in the first quarter of 2016.   
     Expenditures for capital assets to grow the partnership distribution will depend on our access to debt and equity capital.  We will look for opportunities to acquire assets from other parties that meet our criteria for stable cash flows. 
  Growth Capital Expenditures  
  We anticipate spending approximately   $65.0 million  , inclusive of capitalized interest, during the remainder of   2016   for projects currently under construction.  The most significant of our projects are described below. 
  Houston Area Crude Oil Pipeline and Terminal Infrastructure 
  We are constructing new, and expanding existing, crude oil pipeline and terminal facilities in Webster, Texas and Texas City, Texas as a result of expanding our crude oil pipeline and terminal infrastructure in the Houston area. We are constructing a new crude oil pipeline that will deliver crude oil received from upstream crude oil pipelines (including CHOPS, which delivers crude oil originating in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to the Texas City area) to our new Texas City Terminal, which will ultimately connect to our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline. Our new Texas City Terminal will initially include approximately 750,000 barrels of crude oil tankage.  As a part of this project, we are also making the necessary upgrades on our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline to reverse the direction of flow. The result of this expanded crude oil infrastructure will allow additional optionality to Houston and Baytown area refineries, including the Exxon-Mobil Baytown refinery, its largest refinery in the U.S.A., and provide additional delivery outlets for other crude oil pipelines. We expect these assets to become operational by the end of 2016.

Wyoming Crude Oil Pipeline 
    In the third quarter of 2015, we completed construction of a new 60 mile crude oil pipeline to transport crude oil from new receipt point stations in Campbell County and Converse County, Wyoming to our existing Pronghorn Rail Facility.  This new crude oil pipeline has an initial capacity of approximately 45,000 barrels per day and is supplied by truck volumes and third party gathering infrastructure in the Powder River Basin.   
    We also constructed a new 75 mile pipeline from our Pronghorn Rail Facility to a delivery point at our new Guernsey Station in Platte County, Wyoming. This Pronghorn to Guernsey pipeline has an initial capacity of approximately 45,000 barrels per day and will allow for connectivity to additional downstream pipeline markets at Guernsey, including regional refineries and Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express Pipeline.  This pipeline became operational in the first quarter of 2016. 
  Baton Rouge Terminal 
    We constructed a new crude oil, intermediates and refined products import/export terminal in Baton Rouge that will be located near the Port of Greater Baton Rouge and will be pipeline-connected to that port's existing deepwater docks on the Mississippi River.  We constructed approximately 1.1 million barrels of tankage for the storage of crude oil, intermediates and/or refined products with the capability to expand to provide additional terminaling services to our customers. In addition, we constructed a new pipeline from the terminal that will allow for deliveries to existing Exxon Mobil facilities in the area, as well as connect our previously constructed 17 mile line to the terminal allowing for receipts from the Scenic Station Rail Facility. Shippers to Scenic Station will have access to both the local Baton Rouge refining market, as well as the ability to access other attractive refining markets via our Baton Rouge Terminal. Our Baton Rouge Terminal and related facilities became operational early in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  Raceland Rail Facility 
  The Raceland Rail Facility, a new crude oil unit train unloading facility located in Raceland, Louisiana and capable of unloading up to two unit trains per day, will be connected to existing midstream infrastructure that will provide direct pipeline access to the Louisiana refining markets.  It is expected to be operational by the end of 2016. 
    Inland     Marine Barge Transportation Expansion  
  We ordered   28   new-build barges and   18   new-build push boats for our inland marine barge transportation fleet. We have accepted delivery of   19   of those barges and   12   of those push boats through   September 30, 2016  .  We expect to take delivery of those remaining vessels periodically through 2016 and 2017. 
    Maintenance Capital Expenditures 
    Our  decrease in maintenance capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   September 30, 2015   primarily relates to our Marine Transportation Segment, where construction of new marine push boats, as completed in 2015, to replace older boats resulted in higher spending during 2015. See further discussion under "Available Cash before Reserves" for how such maintenance capital utilization is reflected in our calculation of Available Cash before reserves. 
  Distributions to Unitholders 
  On   November 14, 2016  , we will pay a distribution of   $0.70   per common unit totaling   $83 million   with respect to the   2016   Quarter to common unitholders of record on   October 28, 2016  . This is the   forty-fifth   consecutive quarter in which we have increased our quarterly distribution. Information on our recent distribution history is included in    Note 9    to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non- GAAP Financial Measures 
  General 
       
  To help evaluate our business, we use the non-generally accepted accounting principle ( non-GAAP ) financial measure of Available Cash before Reserves. We also present total Segment Margin as if it were a non-GAAP measure. Our Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The schedules above provide reconciliations of Available Cash before Reserves to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). A reconciliation of total Segment Margin to net income is also included in our segment disclosure in    Note 10    to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information.  Our Available Cash before Reserves and total Segment Margin measures are just two of the relevant data points considered from time to time. 
  When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of directors and management team has access to a wide range of historical and forecasted qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information; various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance, liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow; and expectations for us, and certain information regarding some of our peers.  Additionally, our board of directors and management team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time.  We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or confuse such investor or other external user. 
  Segment Margin 
    
    Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and capital investment. We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges, such as depreciation and amortization), and segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable cash generated by our equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of our legacy stock appreciation rights plan and unrealized gains and losses on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Our Segment Margin definition also includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing leases. 
  A reconciliation of total Segment Margin to net income is included in our segment disclosure in    Note 10    to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Available Cash before Reserves 
  Purposes, Uses and Definition 
  Available Cash before Reserves, also referred to as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements  such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things: 
           (1) 
    the financial performance of our assets; 
              (2) 
    our operating performance; 
              (3) 
    the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry; 
              (4) 
    the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and 
              (5) 
    our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of indebtedness. 
     We define Available Cash before Reserves as net income as adjusted for specific items, the most significant of which are the addition of certain non-cash gains or charges (including depreciation and amortization), the substitution of distributable  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents   

cash generated by our equity investees in lieu of our equity income attributable to our equity investees (includes distributions attributable to the quarter and received during or promptly following such quarter), the elimination of gains and losses on asset sales (except those from the sale of surplus assets), unrealized gains and losses on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, the elimination of expenses related to acquiring or constructing assets that provide new sources of cash flows and the subtraction of maintenance capital utilized, which is described in detail below. 
  Recent Change in Circumstances and Disclosure Format 
  We have implemented a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because of our expectation that our future maintenance capital expenditures may change materially in nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time.  We believe that, without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our modified disclosure format provides those users with new information in the form of our maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before Reserves).  Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. 
  Maintenance Capital Requirements 
  Maintenance Capital Expenditures 
  Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances. 
  Historically, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures have been (a) related to our pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure.  Those historical expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any) discretion as to whether or when we incurred them.  We had to incur them in order to continue to operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices.  If we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or economically in the absence of such replacement. 
  Prospectively, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels, trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure.  Those future expenditures will be discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to whether or when we incur them.  We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner.  If we chose not make those expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses, including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses. 
  In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was required historically.  Management s recently increasing ability to determine if and when to incur certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures.  We believe it would be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures, distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a new measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of Available Cash before Reserves.  Our maintenance capital utilized measure, which is described in more detail below, constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period. 
  Maintenance Capital Utilized 
  We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We define our maintenance capital utilized measure as  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents   

that portion of the amount of previously incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those projects/components. 
  Because we have not historically used our maintenance capital utilized measure, our future maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013. Further, we do not have the actual comparable calculations for our prior periods, and we may not have the information necessary to make such calculations for such periods.  And, even if we could locate and/or re-create the information necessary to make such calculations, we believe it would be unduly burdensome to do so in comparison to the benefits derived. 
  Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
  There have been no material changes to the commitments and obligations reflected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, or financing partnerships, other than as disclosed under  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , nor do we have any debt or equity triggers based upon our unit or commodity prices. 
  Forward Looking Statements 
  The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical information may be  forward looking statements  as defined under federal law. All statements, other than historical facts, included in this document that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including things such as plans for growth of the business, future capital expenditures, competitive strengths, goals, references to future goals or intentions and other such references are forward-looking statements, and historical performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts.

     You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. When considering forward-looking statements, please review the risk factors described under  Risk Factors  discussed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . These risks may also be specifically described in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and Form 8-K/A and other documents that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Except as required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend to update these forward-looking statements and information. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  The following should be read in conjunction with Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included under Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no material changes that would affect the quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided therein. Also, see    Note 13    to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, with the participation of our management, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is accumulated and communicated to them and our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  There were no changes during the third quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

           a. 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b. 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c. 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation, and
