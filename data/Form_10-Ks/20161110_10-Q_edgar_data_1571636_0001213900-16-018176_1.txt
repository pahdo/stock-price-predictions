BACKGROUND, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND GOING CONCERN:   

Background    

NanoFlex
Power Corporation, formerly known as Universal Technology Systems, Corp., was incorporated in the State of Florida on January
28, 2013. On September 24, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Global Photonic Energy Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation
( GPEC ), pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share Exchange Transaction ). Immediately following
the closing of the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company owned 100% of equity interests of GPEC and GPEC became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. On November 25, 2013, the Company changed its name from  Universal Technology Systems, Corp. 
to  NanoFlex Power Corporation  and its trading symbol was changed to  OPVS  on December 26, 2013.  

GPEC
was incorporated in Pennsylvania on February 7, 1994. The Company is organized to fund, develop, commercialize and license advanced
configuration solar technologies which enable unique thin-film solar cell implementations with industry-leading efficiencies,
light weight, flexibility, and low total system cost.  

These
technologies are targeted at certain broad applications, including: (a) mobile and field power generation, (b) building applied
photovoltaics ( BAPV ), (c) building integrated photovoltaics ( BIPV ), (d) space vehicles and unmanned aerial
vehicles ( UAVs ), (e) semi-transparent solar power generating windows or glazing, and (f) ultra-thin solar films or
paints for automobiles or other consumer applications.  

We
believe these technologies have been demonstrated in a laboratory environment with our research partners. The Company is currently
taking steps to pursue product development and commercialization on some of these technologies in collaboration with industry
partners and potential customers.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Certain information and footnote disclosures have been or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include normal recurring adjustments that are
necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. These consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other periods.  

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make a number of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and
related disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Revision
of Previously-Issued Financial Statements   

During
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company identified errors in its financial statements for the third and fourth quarters
of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as included in the Company s
10-Q for the periods ended September 30, 2015 and March 31, 2016, and its 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, related to the accounting
for conversion option derivative liabilities. Specifically, the Company accounted for all of its convertible debt instruments
assuming that each contained an embedded conversion feature that met the criteria for bifurcation when, in fact, several of the
outstanding notes contained embedded conversion features that did not require bifurcation. The Company has made adjustments in
each period related to this.  

The
Company assessed the effect of the above errors in the aggregate on prior periods  financial statements in accordance with
the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and 108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors,
determined that the errors were not material to any of the Company s prior interim and annual financial statements.  

The
Company determined that the correction of the cumulative amounts of the errors would be material to its consolidated financial
statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Therefore, the Company revised its previously-issued financial statements
as of December 31, 2015 and for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 and first quarter of fiscal 2016. The balance sheet
as of December 31, 2015 and the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included in this
Form 10-Q are revised as described below for those adjustments.  

All
financial information contained in the accompanying notes to these financial statements has been revised to reflect the correction
of these errors.   

The
following tables present the effect of the aforementioned revisions on the Company s consolidated balance sheet for the
year ended December 31, 2015:  

The
following tables present the effect of the aforementioned revisions on the Company s consolidated statement of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015:  

These
revisions to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 did not result in any changes
to the amounts previously reported for net cash from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities.  

Going
Concern    

The
Company has generated limited revenue to date.  The Company has a working capital deficit of $18,983,497 and an accumulated
deficit of $207,732,287 as of September 30, 2016.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on raising capital to fund ongoing operations and carry out its business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly,
these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. To date, the Company has funded
its initial operations primarily by way of the sale of equity securities, convertible note financing, short term financing from
private parties, and advances from related parties.  

Fair
Value    

ASC
820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. It defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
that are not active; and model-driven valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Valuations may be obtained from, or corroborated by, third-party pricing services.  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs to measure fair value of assets and liabilities for which there is little, if any market activity at the
measurement date, using reasonable inputs and assumptions based upon the best information at the time, to the extent that inputs
are available without undue cost and effort.  

As
of September 30, 2016 the significant inputs to the Company s derivative liability calculation were Level 3 inputs.  

The
following schedule summarizes the valuation of financial instruments at fair value in the balance sheets as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015:  

The
following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level
3 in the fair value hierarchy:

DEBT   

Notes
Payable    

The
Company has a note payable of $100,000 due to its former Chief Executive Officer and President. The note is due on demand and
bears an interest rate at the minimum applicable rate for loans of similar duration, which was 0.5% as of September 30, 2016.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued a promissory note of $50,000. The term of the note expires 120 days from
the effective date. 100,000 cashless warrants for the Company s common shares were issued with the debt at a strike price
of $0.50/share in lieu of cash interest.. The relative fair value of the warrants of $45,243 was recognized as a debt discount
which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the note. The Company recognized interest expense of $45,243
associated with the amortization of debt discount for the year ended December 31, 2015. On May 12, 2016, this note was forgiven
in exchange for a new convertible note that bears interest of 8% per annum, a maturity date of one year and is convertible into
units at $0.50 per unit, with each unit consisting of a share of common stock and a warrant with a five year life from the date
of conversion and an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. This modification qualifies
as an extinguishment of debt. The fair value of 50,000 warrants issued in connection with the modification which have a term of
5 years and are exercisable at $0.50 per share resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $44,044. The modified note also
gave rise to a beneficial conversion feature of $37,584 which is recognized as additional paid in capital and a corresponding
debt discount. All debt discounts are being recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the note. The note also contains
an additional warrant expense of $12,415 associated with the warrants that are to be issued upon conversion, which is to be recognized
only upon conversion.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued a promissory note of $300,000. The term of the note expires one
year from the effective date and has an interest rate of 10%. 600,000 cashless warrants for the Company s common shares
were issued with the debt at a strike price of $0.50/share in lieu of cash interest. The relative fair value of the warrants of
$235,188 was recognized as a debt discount which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the note. The Company
recognized interest expense of $19,599 associated with the amortization of debt discount for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of non-convertible notes payable was $400,000 and
$150,000, respectively.  

Notes
Payable   Related Party    

On
February 26, 2014, the Company borrowed $150,000 under a short term note agreement with a related party, the Chief Executive Officer s
son. Under the terms of this agreement, the note was to be repaid within 6 months of funding. In November 2014, the note
agreement was amended to extend the due date to February 26, 2015, and in April of 2015, the note agreement was amended to extend
the maturity date to February 26, 2016 and set a 4% simple interest rate on the note. This note was paid in full in January of
2016 along with $509 of accrued interest.  

In
2015, the Company issued promissory notes to a majority shareholder in aggregate of $625,000 ( Notes #1 to #4 ). The
notes have a term ranging from 120   150 days from the effective date. 1,250,000 cashless warrants for the Company s
common shares were issued with the debt at a strike price of $0.50/share in lieu of cash interest. On January 6, 2016, the Company
issued an additional promissory note to the same majority shareholder in the amount of $1,375,000 in exchange for a loan in that
amount ( Note #5). The Company issued 2,750,000 warrants in connection with this Note #5, for the Company s common
stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The total relative fair value of the warrants of $996,178 was recognized as a debt
discount which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes. Notes #1 to #4 and Note #5 shall be collectively
referred to herein as the  $2M Notes.   

On
January 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Note Conversion Agreement (the  Conversion Agreement ) with the holder
of the $2 million notes. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, the investor converted the $2 million notes, which totaled $2,000,000,
into an investment of $2,000,000 into the Company s private placement of convertible notes and warrants. This extinguishment
of the $2 million notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3,163,303 which included an unamortized discount of $926,382
and $2,236,921 representing the fair value of 2,000,000 warrants issued in connection with the Note Conversion Agreement. Additionally,
the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature of $1,100,735 in accordance with the provisions of ASC 470-20   Debt
  Debt with Conversion and Other Options   which is reflected as an increase in additional paid-in-capital and
a corresponding debt discount which was amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the note.  

On
January 25, 2016, the investor converted the convertible note and accrued interest into 4,320,000 shares of the Company s
common stock and a warrant to purchase 4,320,000 shares of the Company s common stock with a ten year term and an exercise
price of $0.50 per share. Of the 4,320,000 shares of common stock, 320,000 shares represent interest paid on the convertible note
pursuant to the terms of the conversion agreement in the amount of $160,000. Upon conversion, the Company accelerated the recognition
of all remaining debt discount and also recognized an additional interest expense of $899,265 associated with the warrants that
were issued upon conversion. This contingent beneficial conversion feature was immediately recognized as interest expense with
an offset to additional paid-in-capital.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of notes payable to related parties was $0 and
$670,848, respectively, net of unamortized discounts of $0 and $104,152, respectively.  

Advances
  Related Party    

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received advances from its Chief Executive Officer totaling $0
and $510,000, respectively, and repaid advances totaling $150,000 and $270,000, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of advances to related parties was $350,000 and
$110,000, respectively.  

Convertible
Notes Payable    

In
addition to the $2,000,000 convertible note described above in the Notes Payable-Related Party section, on March 7, 2016, the
Company received proceeds of $80,000 in exchange for a convertible note and the issuance of 80,000 warrants with a five year life
and an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The convertible note has a principal amount of $80,000, interest of 8% per annum, a
maturity date of one year and is convertible into 160,000 units, with each unit consisting of a share of common stock and a warrant
with a five year life from the date of conversion and an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.
The relative fair value of the 80,000 warrants issued with the debt was determined to be $38,205 and was recognized as a discount
to the debt. This note also gave rise to a beneficial conversion feature of $22,290 which is recognized as additional-paid-in
capital and a corresponding debt discount. All debt discounts are being recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
note. The note also contains an additional warrant expense of $19,505 associated with the warrants that are to be issued upon
conversion, which is to be recognized only upon conversion.  

From
April 18, 2016 through June 30, 2016, the Company received additional aggregate proceeds of $375,000 in exchange for eight convertible
notes and the issuance of 375,000 warrants with a five year life and exercise price of $0.50 per share. The convertible notes
have an aggregate principal amount of $375,000, interest of 8% per annum, a maturity date of one year and are convertible into
an aggregate of 750,000 units, with each unit consisting of a share of common stock and a warrant with a five year life from the
date of conversion and an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. The aggregate relative
fair value of the 375,000 warrants issued with the debt was determined to be $158,423 and was recognized as a discount to the
debt. These notes also gave rise to a beneficial conversion feature of $116,129 which is recognized as additional paid in capital
and a corresponding debt discount. All debt discounts are being recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the note.
The note also contains an additional warrant expense of $100,449 associated with the warrants that are to be issued upon conversion,
which is to be recognized only upon conversion.    

On
July 13, 2016, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which an investor purchased a promissory
note from the Company and received 500,000 warrants with a seven year life and exercise price of $0.50 per share in exchange for
$500,000. The promissory note had a clause that automatically modified it 30 days after issuance (on August 12, 2016) into a convertible
note. The convertible note has a principal amount of $500,000, includes the issuance of 500,000 additional warrants, interest
of 8% per annum, a maturity date of one year and is convertible into 1,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of a share of
common stock and a warrant with a five year life from the date of conversion and an exercise price of $0.50 per share, subject
to certain anti-dilution provisions. The relative fair value of the 500,000 warrants issued on July 13, 2016 was $161,010. The

Warrants    

On
September 1, 2015 the Company entered into an Employment Agreement (the  Employment Agreement ) with Mark Tobin in
his capacity as the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, on September 1, 2015 the Company
issued Mr. Tobin warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.00 per share (the  Warrant
Shares ). The fair value of the warrants was determined to be $2,835,061 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 375,000
of the Warrant Shares vested on September 1, 2015, an additional 375,000 warrant shares vested on the first anniversary date of
the Employment Agreement, an additional 375,000 warrant shares will vest on the second anniversary date of the Employment Agreement,
and, an additional 375,000 warrant shares will vest on the third anniversary date of the Employment Agreement. Warrant expense
of $265,787 and $915,489 was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The agreement
contains an anti-dilution provision and therefore the exercise price at September 30, 2016 is $0.50 per share.  

On
September 23, 2016, the Company issued warrants to purchase 15,000 shares of the Company s common stock at $1.00 per share
to a consultant in exchange for services already performed. The warrants have a five year term and are immediately vested. The

The
following summarizes the warrant activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Derivative
Liabilities - Warrants    

The
anti-dilution features in the freestanding warrants issued in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 cause the instruments to
no longer be indexed to the Company s own stock and requires that they be accounted for as derivative liabilities based
on guidance in FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.  

The
valuation of the derivative liability of the warrants was determined through the use of a Black Scholes options model, which the
Company believes approximates fair value. Using this model, the Company had a balance of $12,796,146 at December 31, 2015. The
Company recorded the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities recognizing a gain of $4,349,645 and warrant expense
of $1,277,699 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to reflect the value of the warrant derivative liability of $8,990,943
as of September 30, 2016.

Legal
Matters    

As
of March 30, 2015, shareholders holding approximately 67.26% of the total shares of common stock of NanoFlex Power Corporation
(the  Company,   we,   our  or  us ) that are entitled to vote on all Company
matters approved by written consent the removal of John D. Kuhns from his position as a member of the Company s Board of
Directors. Mr. Kuhns  removal was for  Cause  as defined under his Employment Agreement as amended and dated
as of October 1, 2013 (the  Employment Agreement ). The removal arose as a result of his documented conduct and statements,
which breached his fiduciary duties to the Company in order to advance personal monetary and other interests, and thereby threatened
serious financial injury to the Company, its shareholders and its debtholders.  

On
March 31, 2015, the Board of Directors terminated the Employment Agreement with Mr. Kuhns for Cause and removed him from his positions
as Co-CEO, and from all other officer positions he held with the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all director
positions with the Company s subsidiaries and affiliates.  

On
April 24, 2015, the Company received a letter from Mr. Kuhns  counsel (the  Response Letter ) stating that Mr.
Kuhns disagreed with statements in the Initial Filing regarding the circumstances of his removal as a director and officer.  

The
Response Letter was accompanied by a copy of a complaint (the  Complaint ) filed by John D, Kuhns (the  Plaintiff )
in the United States District Court Southern District of New York against the Company, Mr. Dean L. Ledger, our current CEO and
member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Robert J. Fasnacht, our former Executive Vice President and former member of our Board of
Directors and Mr. Ronald B. Foster, a shareholder of the Company (each, a  Defendant,  collectively, the  Defendants ).
The Complaint alleges, among other things, that the Plaintiff was terminated by the Company in violation of Section 922 of the
Dodd-Frank Act, that the Company wrongfully terminated the Employment Agreement, that the Defendants made false statements to
shareholders regarding the Plaintiff, that the Defendants (other than the Company) tortuously interfered with the Plaintiff s
Employment Agreement, and that Mr. Ledger and Mr. Fasnacht breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders.   

The
Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, including (i) two (2) times of the alleged owed compensation to him, together with interest
as well as litigation costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys  fees; (ii) damages for the alleged breach of
the Employment Agreement by the Company, estimated to be at least $2 million, plus interest and attorney s fees; (iii) an
unspecified amount for his alleged libel claim; and (iv) damages for the alleged tortious interference with contract, including
punitive damages of at least $2 million. The Plaintiff is also seeking a declaratory judgment, claiming that he was not terminated
as a director and should continue to hold a seat on the Company s Board of Directors.  

On
September 3, 2015 the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss portions of the Complaint in the United States District Court Southern
District of New York. The United States District Court Southern District of New York heard oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss
on June 23, 2016, and at the conclusion took the Motion to Dismiss under advisement. The Court ruled on August 24, 2016, regarding
the Motion to Dismiss, and granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part.  

The Court granted a
dismissal of all claims against Mr. Foster and dismissal of the Plaintiff s declaratory judgment claim. All other claims
by the Plaintiff continue to be outstanding. The Company filed an answer to the Complaint on September 14, 2016, and the Plaintiff
responded to the Company s counter claims contained in the Company s answer on November 7, 2016. 

Other than the foregoing,
there have been no new developments in the case since the filing of the answer. The Company believes that the Plaintiff s
allegations and claims are without any merit and plans to continue to vigorously defend against the claims.

NanoFlex
Power Corporation is engaged in the development, commercialization, and licensing of advanced configuration solar technologies
which we believe enable unique thin-film solar cell implementations with industry-leading efficiencies, light weight, flexibility,
and low total system cost. NanoFlex has the exclusive worldwide license to the intellectual property resulting from the Company's
sponsored research programs, which have resulted in an extensive portfolio of issued and pending U.S. patents, plus foreign counterparts.
The patents are referred to herein as being the Company s patents or as the Company s  IP.  Building upon
the sponsored research, the Company plans to work with industry partners and customers to commercialize its technologies to target
key applications where it believes products incorporating its technologies present compelling competitive advantages.  

The
Company s research programs have yielded two solar thin film technology platforms   (1) cost reducing and performance-enhancing
technologies for ultra-high efficiency thin films and (2) organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology for applications demanding high
quality aesthetics, such as semi-transparency and tinting and ultra-flexible form factors. These technologies are targeted at
certain broad applications, including: (a) mobile and off-grid solar power generation, (b) building applied photovoltaics ( BAPV ),
(c) building integrated photovoltaics ( BIPV ), (d) space vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ),
(e) semi-transparent photovoltaic windows or glazing and (f) ultra-thin solar films or paints for automobiles or other consumer
applications. We believe these technologies have been demonstrated in a laboratory environment with our research partners. The
Company is currently taking steps to pursue product development and commercialization on some of these technologies in collaboration
with industry partners and potential customers.  

The
Company currently holds exclusive rights to an extensive portfolio of issued and pending U.S. patents, plus foreign counterparts,
which cover architecture, processes and materials for high efficiency solar technologies and flexible, thin-film OPVs. In addition,
the Company has an extensive collection of patents in process. Some of our technology holdings include foundational concepts in
the following areas:  

Ultra-low
    cost, ultra-high efficiency, flexible thin film III-V cells   

Accelerated
    and recyclable liftoff process   

Cold-weld
    bonding of GaAs solar cells to plastic substrates and metal foils   

Micro-inverters
    monolithically integrated into III-V solar cells   

Low
    cost, thermo-formed plastic mini-compound parabolic concentrator arrays   

Protective
    and sacrificial layering of III-V solar cell growth

Overall
Operating Plan   

NanoFlex
plans to license or sublicense its intellectual property to industry partners and customers, rather than being a direct manufacturer
of its technologies. These manufacturing partners can supply customers directly, but also serve as a source of solar cell supply
for NanoFlex to provide products to customers on its own through a  fab-less  manufacturing model, particularly in
the early stages of market development. This business model is oriented around licensing and sublicensing processes and technologies
to large, well-positioned commercial partners who can provide manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable rapid commercial
growth.  

We
have made contact with major solar cell and electronics manufacturers world-wide and are finding commercial interest in both our
high efficiency and OPV technologies. We are seeking to work closely with those companies interested in our technology solutions
to develop proof-of-concept prototypes and processes to mitigate commercialization risks and gain early market entry and acceptance.  

A
key to reducing the risk to market entry of the Company s high efficiency technologies by our partners is for us to demonstrate
our technologies on their product designs and fabrication processes.  To support this joint development, the Company has
established its own engineering team and plans to expand this team contingent on its ability to secure government research projects
or raise the necessary capital. This team is to be tasked with serving several key functions, including working closely with the
Company s sponsored research organizations and its industry partners to integrate and customize our proprietary processes
and technologies into the partner s existing product designs and fabrication processes. Our engineering team would also
work closely with downstream partners and customers such as military users for mobile field applications and system integrators,
installers, and architects for BAPV and BIPV applications, and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies and
project developers for solar farm applications. This customer interaction allows NanoFlex to better understand application specific
requirements and incorporate these requirements into our product development cycle.  

To
support this work, the Company s engineering team leverages the facilities and equipment at the University of Michigan on
a recharge basis, which we believe is a cost effective approach to move the technologies toward commercialization. We believe
that this allows our engineering team to work directly with industry players to acquire early licenses to use our intellectual
property without the need for large-scale capital investment in clean room facilities and solar cell fabrication equipment.   

Additionally,
having an established technical team enables us to more effectively pursue and execute sponsored research projects from the Department
of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), each of which has
interests in businesses that can deliver ultra-lightweight, high-efficiency solar technologies for demanding applications.  

A
second potential revenue source is from joint development agreements (JDAs) with existing solar cell manufacturers. Once we are
able to initially demonstrate the efficacy of our processes and technologies on partner s products and fabrication processes,
we expect to be in a position where we can sign licenses covering further joint development, IP licensing, solar cell supply and
joint marketing, as applicable. We anticipate that partnerships with one or more of the existing high efficiency solar cell manufacturers
can be supported by NanoFlex s engineering team, and result in early revenue opportunities, as we have demonstrated with
our initial manufacturing partner.    

Near
Term Operating Plan   

Our
near-term focus is on advancing our product development efforts while containing costs. The Company requires approximately $6
million to $8 million to continue its operations over the next twelve months to support its development and commercialization
activities, fund patent application and prosecution, service outstanding liabilities, and support its corporate functions. Our
operating plan over the next twelve months is comprised of the following:  

1.  
      Cost
    cutting and containment to reduce our cash operating expenses;   

2.  
      Prioritizing
    and optimizing our existing IP portfolio to align it with the commercialization strategy and reduce costs;   

3.  
      Focusing
    research and development investments on near-term commercialization opportunities;   

4.  
      Collaborating
    with strategic partners to accelerate joint development and licensing of our technologies;   

5.  
      Selectively
    pursuing government-sponsored projects to fund product development and commercialization; and   

6.  
      Raising
    adequate capital (approximately $6 million to $8 million) to support our activities for at least 12 months.   

We
believe that we have made progress with each of the components of this operating plan and have aligned our operations and cost
structure with expediting the development and commercialization of our high efficiency solar technologies. We have taken steps
to reduce patent expenses, particularly related to optimizing our OPV patent portfolio. We have realigned our research and development
operations with several strategic actions, including hiring NanoFlex engineers to focus on high efficiency product development
and technology transfer from the University of Michigan to a commercial environment with our industry partner, establishing a
new sponsored research agreement with the University of Michigan focused on research and development of high efficiency technology
in support of our commercialization efforts, and temporarily suspending our OPV-related sponsored research activities to reduce
near-term expenditures while we seek a development partner for OPV commercialization. We remain focused on increasing our revenue
through joint development agreements with industry partners and through government-sponsored research projects and we believe
that we are making positive progress with these efforts.  

There
can be no assurance that our near term operating plan will be successful or that we will be able to fulfill it as it is largely
dependent on raising capital and there can be no assurance that capital can be raised nor that we will be awarded the government
contracts that we are currently pursuing.  

In
the event that we raise less than the required amount of capital, our focus is planned to be on prioritizing our commercialization
effort to capture near-term revenue opportunities and limiting spending on general and administrative expenses and patent costs.  

Results
of Operations   

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue    

Revenue
was $85,000 and $115,400 for the three and nine months ended September 20, 2016, respectively. This relates to revenue earned
for engineering services provided under our JDA. There was no revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

    Cost
of Services    

Cost
of services was $97,829 and $331,710 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. This relates to expenses incurred
as part of our engineering services provided under our JDA. There was no cost of services for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  

Research
and Development Expenses    

Research
and development expenses were $299,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an 8% decrease from $327,253 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is attributable to decreased amounts of expense related to the
Company s research agreement with USC. Research and development expenses were $1,475,847 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, a 78% increase from $828,002 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is attributable
to non-cash expenses of $1,277,701 associated with warrants issued to consultants and executives during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. There were no non-cash expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These increases were partially
offset by lower expense associated with the Company s sponsored research activity.  

Patent
Application and Prosecution Fees    

Patent
application and prosecution fees consist of expenses associated with prosecuting and maintaining the patents resulting from
the research program sponsored by NanoFlex and were $649,378 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a 102% increase from
$321,643 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   Patent application and prosecution fees were $1,187,145 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a 20% decrease from $1,490,657 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These fluctuations
are attributable to the timing and volume of the submittal and prosecution of patent applications.  

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses    

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $772,508 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a 40% decrease from $1,281,736
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to decreased non-cash expenses associated with warrants
issued to executives, which equaled $265,787 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $817,049 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,122,330 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, a 19% decrease from $2,629,669 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction
in salaries and professional fees partially offset by an increase in non-cash expenses of $98,440 associated with warrants issued
to executives.  

Other
Expense    

Other
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,034,437 as compared to $9,724,978 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,226,177 as compared to $12,853,899 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. These changes are primarily due to the gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative
liabilities, the timing of entering into interest bearing debt agreements and the timing of the conversion of existing debt and
extinguishment of old debt.  

Net
Loss    

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,768,652, as compared to $11,655,610 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,227,809, as compared to $17,802,227 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. These changes are impacted by non-cash income and expenses, including the gain (loss) on change in fair
value of the derivative liability offset by an increase in interest expense, changes in research and development, patent application
and prosecution fees, and selling, and general and administrative expenses, each of which is described above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Sources
of Liquidity    

As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $41,725 and a working capital deficit of $18,983,497, as compared to
cash and cash equivalents of $6,255 and a working capital deficit of $25,404,178 as of December 31, 2015. The increase in cash
is due to the increase in related party advances compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital is attributable
to the gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.   

The
Company needs to raise additional capital and is in the process of raising additional funds in order to continue to finance our
research and development, service existing liabilities and commercialize photonic energy conversion technologies utilizing organic
semiconductor-based solar cells.  We need to raise approximately $6 million to $8 million in additional capital in order
to continue our operations as described above and support our corporate functions for the next twelve months. We anticipate that
the additional funding can result from private sales of our equity securities. However, there can be no assurance that the additional
funds will be available to us when needed, or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us or our shareholders. If it
is unable to raise sufficient funds the Company may have to cease its operations.  

Analysis
of Cash Flows    

Net
cash used in operating activities increased by $1,002,518 to $3,599,240 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $2,596,722 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in cash used in operating activities was attributable
primarily to decreased net loss partially offset by a net gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities and debt extinguishment
and an increase in working capital.  

There
were no investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $3,634,710 and $2,749,568 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 this includes proceeds for sale of common shares and warrants
of $663,922, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $6,288, borrowings from short-term debt of 300,000, borrowings on related
party debt of $1,375,000, borrowings on convertible debt of $1,199,500, advances received from related party of $510,000, partially
offset by advances repaid to related party of $270,000 and payments on related party debt of $150,000. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 this includes proceeds from sale of common shares and warrants of $86,000, proceeds from exercise of warrants
of $914,218, borrowings from short  term debt of $50,000, borrowings on related party debt of $300,000, borrowings on convertible
debt of $1,657,500, advances received from related party of $193,350, offset by advances repaid to related party of $451,500.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company has only generated limited revenues to date.  The Company has a working capital deficit of $18,893,497 and an
accumulated deficit of $207,732,287 as of September 30, 2016. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent on raising capital to fund ongoing operations and carry out its business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations.  Accordingly,
these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

There
were no changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from those set forth in  Critical
Accounting Policies  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March
18, 2016.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide
the information under this item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the Company;   

Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and   

Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  

As
of September 30, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework ( 2013 )issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) and SEC guidance on conducting such
assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and
procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was
due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected
our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.   

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were:  

(1)
The Company s board of directors has no audit committee, independent director or member with financial expertise, which
causes ineffective oversight of the Company s external financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting;  

(2)
We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size
and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to
the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our
disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness;  

(3)
We lack the financial infrastructure to account for complex debt and equity transactions which may result in a greater than normal
risk that material errors may occur in the financial statements and not be detected timely; and  

(4)
We lack qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly, and the scope and effectiveness of the internal
audit function are yet to be developed. Specifically, the reporting mechanism between the accounting department and the Board
of Directors and the CFO was not effective;  

The
aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with
the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.  

Additionally,
due to the material weakness identified in number (3) listed above, as discussed in Note 1, the Company made certain errors in
its previously filed financial statements. Specifically, the Company made errors related to the accounting for conversion option
derivative liabilities, based on the assumption that each of the Company s convertible debt instruments contained an embedded
conversion feature that met the criteria for bifurcation when, in fact, this was not the case. During the three months ended June
30, 2016, the Company identified these errors in its financial statements for the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015, as included in the Company s 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015 and its 2015 annual report
on Form 10-K. The Company assessed the effect of the above errors in the aggregate on prior periods  financial statements
in accordance with the SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and 108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative
factors, determined that the errors were not material to any of the Company s prior interim and annual financial statements.
The Company determined that the correction of the cumulative amounts of the errors would be material to three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016. Therefore, the Company revised its previously-issued financial statements in the accompanying notes
to the financial statements in this report as further discussed in Note 1 above.  

Management s
Remediation Initiatives and Changes to Internal Controls    

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:  

(1) We
previously did not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures . Written documentation of
key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to
us. Management previously evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures
on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and had concluded that the control deficiency represented a material
weakness.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, management completed its written documentation of internal control policies
and procedures and we now consider this weakness to be remediated.  

(2) We
have created a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and increased our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function.  

(3) We
have established more reliable procedures regarding the tracking of complex debt and equity transactions that we enter into.  

(4) We
plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting
in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available
to us.    

We
expect to evaluate the effectiveness of these control process improvements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no other significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls
subsequent to the period covered by this report.  

Further,
subsequent to the period covered by the report, management plans to implement measures to remediate the material weaknesses in
internal controls over financial reporting described above to the extent sufficient capital is available to do so. Specifically,
the CEO and CFO are seeking to improve communications regarding the importance of documentation of their assessments and conclusions
of their meetings, as well as supporting analyses. As the business increases, the Company is seeking to hire accounting professionals
and it will continue its efforts to create an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures for financial reporting.  

The
Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's
registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that
may harm our business.  

On
March 18, 2015, the Company received correspondence from the counsel of Mr. John Kuhns, the Company s former Co-CEO and
Executive Chairman alleging that Mr. Kuhns has  Good Reason  to terminate his Employment Agreement, as amended and
dated as of October 1, 2013 (the  Employment Agreement ), for an alleged failure to pay his salary in full. On March
30, 2015, Mr. Kuhns advised that if the alleged breaches of the Employment Agreement were not cured there was a possibility that
he would pursue litigation  

As
of March 30, 2015, shareholders holding approximately 67.26% of the total shares of common stock of the Company that are entitled
to vote on all Company matters approved by written consent the removal of John D. Kuhns from his position as a member of the Company s
Board of Directors. Mr. Kuhns  removal was for  Cause  as defined under his Employment Agreement.. The removal
arose as a result of his documented conduct and statements, which breached his fiduciary duties to the Company in order to advance
personal monetary and other interests, and thereby threatened serious financial injury to the Company, its shareholders and its
debtholders. On March 31, 2015, the Board of Directors terminated the Employment Agreement with Mr. Kuhns for Cause and removed
him from his positions as Co-CEO, and from all other officer positions he held with the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates,
and all director positions with the Company s subsidiaries and affiliates.  

On
April 24, 2015, the Company received a letter from Mr. Kuhns  counsel (the  Response Letter ) stating that Mr.
Kuhns disagreed with statements in the Initial Filing regarding the circumstances of his removal as a director and officer.  

The
Response Letter was accompanied by a copy of a complaint (the  Complaint ) filed by John D, Kuhns (the  Plaintiff )
in the United States District Court Southern District of New York against the Company, Mr. Dean L. Ledger, our current CEO and
member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Robert J. Fasnacht, our former Executive Vice President and former member of our Board of
Directors and Mr. Ronald B. Foster, a shareholder of the Company (each, a  Defendant,  collectively, the  Defendants ).
The Complaint alleges, among other things, that the Plaintiff was terminated by the Company in violation of Section 922 of the
Dodd-Frank Act, that the Company wrongfully terminated the Employment Agreement, that the Defendants made false statements to
shareholders regarding the Plaintiff, that the Defendants (other than the Company) tortiously interfered with the Plaintiff s
Employment Agreement, and that Mr. Ledger and Mr. Fasnacht breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders.  

The
Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, including (i) two (2) times of the alleged owed compensation to him, together with interest
as well as litigation costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys  fees; (ii) damages for the alleged breach of
the Employment Agreement by the Company, estimated to be at least $2 million, plus interest and attorney s fees; (iii) an
unspecified amount for his alleged libel claim; and (iv) damages for the alleged tortious interference with contract, including
punitive damages of at least $2 million. The Plaintiff is also seeking a declaratory judgment, claiming that he was not terminated
as a director and should continue to hold a seat on the Company s Board of Directors.  

On
September 3, 2015 the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss portions of the Complaint in the United States District Court Southern
District of New York. The United States District Court Southern District of New York heard oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss
on June 23, 2016, and at the conclusion took the Motion to Dismiss under advisement. The Court ruled on August 24, 2016, regarding
the Motion to Dismiss, and granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part.  

The Court granted a dismissal of all
claims against Mr. Foster and dismissal of the Plaintiff s declaratory judgment claim. All other claims by the Plaintiff
continue to be outstanding. The Company filed an answer to the Complaint on September 14, 2016, and the Plaintiff responded to
the Company s counter claims contained in the Company s answer on November 7, 2016. 

Other than the foregoing, there have
been no new developments in the case. The Company believes that the Plaintiff s allegations and claims are without any merit
and plans to continue to vigorously defend against the claims.

Private
Placement of the Company s Notes   

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which an
investor purchased a promissory note from the Company in exchange for $500,000. The Note automatically converted by its terms
30 days after issuance into an investment in the principal amount of the note in the Company s convertible notes and warrants,
and upon automatic conversion, the investor was issued a one year promissory note for $500,000 convertible into shares of the
Company s Common Stock at a $0.50 conversion price and 5 year warrants to purchase 500,000 share of Common Stock with an
exercise price of $0.50 and a cashless conversion feature. In connection with the note purchase agreement the investor was also
issued a warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock with a term of 7 years and an exercise price of $0.50 and a cashless
conversion feature.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which the
investor purchased a promissory note from the Company in exchange for $300,000. Pursuant to the note purchase agreement the investor
was also issued a warrant to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock with a 5 year term and $0.50 exercise
price and a cashless conversion feature.  

On October 7, 2016 the Company entered
into a note purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which an investor purchased a promissory note from the Company in

Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof and applicable law. 

13.           Maintenance
of Liability Insurance . So long as the Executive shall serve as an executive officer of the Company pursuant to this Agreement,
the Company shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect a policy of director and officer liability insurance of at least

all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive s
devisee, legatee, or other designee or, in the absence of such designee, to the Executive s estate or trust. 

14.3              Name
Change . Upon any name change by Company, no assignment need occur as the same entity is bound by the terms of this Agreement. 

15.          Dispute
Resolution and Notice .  

15.1              Dispute
Resolution . Either the Executive or the Company may elect to have any good faith dispute or  controversy
arising under or in connection with this Agreement settled by arbitration, by providing written notice of such election to the
other party hereto, specifying the nature of the dispute to be arbitrated, provided that if the other party objects to the use
of arbitration within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice, the dispute may only be settled by litigation unless otherwise
agreed. If arbitration is selected, such proceeding shall be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators sitting in a location
agreed to by the Company and the Executive within fifty (50) miles from the location of the Executive s principal place of
employment, in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.
Judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrators in any court having competent jurisdiction. To the extent that the Executive
prevails in any litigation or arbitration seeking to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled
to reimbursement by the Company of all expenses of such litigation or arbitration, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
the legal representative for the Executive, and necessary costs and disbursements incurred as a result of such dispute or legal
proceeding.  

15.2              Notice .
Any notices, requests, demands, or other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and if
sent by registered or certified mail to the Executive at the last address he has filed in writing with the Company or, in the case
of the Company, at its principal offices. 

16.           No
Mitigation . The Executive shall have no duty to seek other employment and the amounts, benefits and entitlements payable to
the Executive hereunder or otherwise shall not be subject to reduction, offset or repayment for any compensation received by the
Executive from services provided by the Executive following the termination of the Executive s employment with the Company. 

17.            Section
409A .  

17.1             The
intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the
regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively  Code Section 409A ) and, accordingly, to the maximum extent
permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable
for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on the Executive by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to
comply with Code Section 409A. 

17.2             A
termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the
payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a   separation
from service   within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references
to a   termination,     termination of employment   or like terms shall mean   separation
from service .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is deemed on the date of
termination to be a   specified employee   within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then
with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A payable
on account of a   separation from service,   such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided until the date
which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such   separation from
service   of the Executive, and (B) the date of the Executive s death, to the extent required under Code Section
409A. Upon the expiration of the foregoing delay period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Agreement (whether
they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed
to the Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance
with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. 

17.3             To
the extent that reimbursements or other in-kind benefits under this Agreement constitute   nonqualified  deferred
compensation     for purposes of Code Section 409A, (A) all such expenses or
other reimbursements hereunder shall be made  on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year
in which such expenses were incurred by the Executive, (B) any right to such reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject
to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (C) no such reimbursement, expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits
provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided,
in any other taxable year. 

17.4             For
purposes of Code Section 409A, the Executive s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies
a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the
sole discretion of the Company. 

17.5             Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that constitutes   nonqualified
deferred compensation   for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset by any other amount unless otherwise permitted
by Code Section 409A. 

18.          Adjustment .
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that as a result of any payment
or distribution by the Company to or for Executive s benefit whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the   Payments  )  , Executive would be subject to the excise
tax imposed by Sections 409A, 280G or Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the
Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the   Excise   Tax ), the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a   Gross-Up
Payment  ) in an amount such that, after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed
with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive
is in the same after-tax position as if no Excise Tax had been imposed upon Executive with respect to the Payments, provided further
that such Gross-Up Payment shall be made prior to April 15th of the calendar year following the year in which Executive receive
any payment or distribution from the Company which gives rise to a Gross-Up Payment. 

19.           Miscellaneous   

19.1              Entire
Agreement . This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements or understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect thereto. 

19.2              Modification .
This Agreement shall not be varied, altered, modified, canceled, changed, or in any way  amended
except by mutual agreement of the parties in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto or their legal representatives.  

19.3              Severability .
In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason,
the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. 

19.4              Tax
Withholding . The Company may withhold from any benefits payable under this Agreement all Federal, state, city, or other taxes

The Executive may designate one or more persons or entities as the primary and/or contingent beneficiaries of any amounts to be
received under this Agreement. Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Board or the Board s
designee. The Executive may make or change such designation at any time. 

19.6              Board
Committee . Any action to be taken, or determination to be made, by the Board under this Agreement may be taken or made by the
compensation committee or any other Committee authorized by the Board of Directors to act on its behalf 

19.7              Governing
Law . To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance

    presented in this report;   

4.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
    Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a.  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b.  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

c.  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about

    evaluation; and

    in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
    financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
    performing the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.

 CERTIFICATION

Exhibit 31.2   

CERTIFICATION   

I,
Mark Tobin, Chief Financial Officer of NanoFlex Power Corporation, formerly known as Universal Technology Systems Corp. (the  registrant ),
certify that:  

1.  
      I
    have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of the registrant for the period ended September 30, 2016;   

2.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;   

4.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
    Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a.  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b.  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c.  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
    the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
    evaluation; and   

d.  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
    financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
    performing the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.
