Note 1: summary of significant accounting policies 

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Vulcan Materials Company (the  Company,   Vulcan,   we,   our ), a   New Jersey   corporation, is the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. 

We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product   aggregates   is used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. We serve markets in   twenty   states, Washington D.C., and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states in metropolitan markets in the United States that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These   three   demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Southwestern and Western markets. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in compliance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and thus do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited financial statement, but it does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of our management, the statements reflect all adjustments, including those of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the results of the reported interim periods. Operating results for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September   30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described in Note 2, the results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation. 

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 

In 2014, we announced changes to our executive management team, and a new divisional organization structure that was effective January 1, 2015. During the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and   September   30, 2015, we incurred   $  320,000   and   $4,  546  ,000  , respectively, of costs related to these initiatives.   We do not expect to incur any f  uture   charges   related   to this   initiative  . 

5   

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) 

Earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below: 

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. Antidilutive common stock equivalents are not included in our earnings per share calculations. In periods of loss, shares that otherwise would have been included in our diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding computation are excluded. There were   no   excluded shares for the periods presented. 

The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which the exercise price exceeds the weighted-average market price is as follows: 

Note 2: Discontinued Operations 

In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. The financial results of the Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. There were   no   revenues from discontinued operations for the periods presented. Results from discontinued operations are as follows: 

Th  e l  osses from discontinued operations noted above   include charges related   to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business.     These losses resulted primarily from charges associated with the Lower Passaic and Texas Brine matters as further discussed in Note 8. 

6   

Note 3: Income Taxes 

Our estimated annual effective tax rate (EAETR) is based on full-year expectations of pretax earnings, statutory tax rates, permanent differences between book and tax accounting such as percentage depletion, and tax planning alternatives available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting, we calculate our quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the EAETR. Each quarter, we update our EAETR based on our revised full-year expectation of pretax earnings and calculate the income tax provision so that the year-to-date income tax provision reflects the EAETR. Significant judgment is required in determining our EAETR. 

In the   third   quarter of 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of   $  52,062,000   compared to   $  45,386  ,000   in the   third   quarter of 2015. The   in  crease in our income tax expense   resulted largely from applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings  . 

For the first   nine   months of 2016, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of   $  116,026,000   compared to   $  51,177,000   for the first   nine   months of 2015. The   in  crease in our income tax expense   resulted largely from applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings  . 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay) based on the differences between the   book basis and tax basis   of assets and liabilitie  s. D  eferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns. With our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  as of December 31, 2015, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as noncurrent. We adopted this standard prospectively and as a result, we did not restate periods prior to adoption. 

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Based on our   third   quarter 2016 analysis, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of all our deferred tax assets with the exception of certain state net operating loss carryforwards.   For   December 31,   2016, we project deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of   $  55,318,000  , of which   $  52,995,000   relates to Alabama. The Alabama net operating loss carryforward, if not utilized, would expire in years   2022       2029  . Prior to 2015, we carried a full valuation allowance against this Alabama deferred tax asset as we did not expect to utilize any portion of it. During 2015, we restructured our legal entities which, among other benefits, resulted in a partial release of the valuation allowance in the amount of   $4,655,000   during the third quarter of 2015. Our analyses over the last   four   quarters have confirmed our third quarter 2015 conclusion but resulted in no further reductions of the valuation allowance. We expect to further reduce, or possibly eliminate, this valuation allowance once we have returned to sustained profitability (as defined in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K), which we project could occur in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax benefit. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. 

A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9  Income Taxes  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Note 4: deferred revenue 

In 2013 and 2012, we sold a percentage interest in future production structured as volumetric production payments (VPPs). 

The VPPs: 

relate to   eight   quarries in Georgia and South Carolina     

provide the purchaser solely with a nonoperating percentage interest in the subject quarries  future production from aggregates reserves     

are both time and volume limited     

contain no minimum annual or cumulative guarantees for production or sales volume, nor minimum sales price     

Our consolidated total revenues exclude the sales of aggregates owned by the VPP purchaser. 

We received net cash proceeds from the sale of the VPPs of   $153,282,000   and   $73,644,000   for the 2013 and 2012 transactions, respectively. These proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and are amortized to     revenue on a unit-of-sales basis over the terms of the VPPs (expected to be approximately   25   years, limited by volume rather than time). 

Reconciliation of the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) is as follows: 

Based on expected sales from the specified quarries, we expect to recognize approximately   $  6,400,000   of deferred revenue as income during the 12-month period ending   September   30  , 2017 (reflected in other current liabilities in our 2016 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet).

Note 5: Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below: 

Level 1:   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2:   Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 

Level 3:   Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

Our a  ssets subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below: 

We have established   two   Rabbi Trusts for the purpose of providing a level of security for the employee nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans and for the directors' nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds and equity securities for which quoted prices in active markets are available. Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in the fund (short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit). 

Net gains (losses) of the Rabbi Trust investments were   $1,379,000   and   $(1,964,000)   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi Trusts at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $273,000   and   $(2,068,000)  , respectively. 

The year-to-date decrease of   $5,269,000   in total Rabbi Trust asset fair values at September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the elections by several retired executives to receive their distributions from the nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans. 

The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, short-term debt, trade payables and accruals, and other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 6 and 7, respectively. 

9   

Assets subject   to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis are summarized below: 

We recorded   $  10,50  6,000   and   $5,190,000   of losses on impairment of long-lived assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reducing the carrying value of these Aggregates segment assets to their estimated fair values of   $0     and   $0  . Fair value was estimated using a market approach (observed transactions involving comparable assets in similar locations). 

Note 6: Derivative Instruments 

During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 

The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. The interest rate swap agreements described below were designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair value of our interest rate swap fair value hedges are recorded as interest expense consistent with the change in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged.  

CASH FLOW HEDGES 

During 2007, we entered into   fifteen   forward starting interest rate locks on   $1,500,000,000   of future debt issuances in order to hedge the risk of higher interest rates. Upon the 2007 and 2008 issuances of the related fixed-rate debt, underlying interest rates were lower than the rate locks and we terminated and settled these forward starting locks for cash payments of   $89,777,000  . This amount was booked to AOCI and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. 

This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as follows: 

The loss reclassified from AOCI for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred loss in the amount of   $7,208,000  , referable to the debt purchases as described in Note 7. 

For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2017, we estimate that   $2,135,000   of the pretax loss in AOCI will be reclassified to earnings. 

10   

FAIR VALUE HEDGES 

In June 2011, we issued   $500,000,000   of   6.50%   fixed-rate notes due in 2016 to refinance near term floating-rate debt. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of   $500,000,000   to reestablish the pre-refinancing mix of fixed-  rate   and floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread of   4.05%   and received a fixed interest rate of   6.50%  . Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our   $150,000,000   of   10.125%   fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of   8.03%   and received a fixed interest rate of   10.125%  . In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for   $25,382,000   of cash proceeds. The   $23,387,000   gain component of the settlement (cash proceeds less   $1,995,000   of accrued interest) was added to the carrying value of the related debt and was amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the related debt using the effective interest method. 

This deferred gain amortization was reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as follows: 

The deferred gain was fully amortized in December 2015, concurrent with the retirement of the 10.125% notes due 2015. The amortized deferred gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of the deferred gain in the amount of   $1,642,000   referable to the debt purchases as described in Note 7. 

11   

Note 7: Debt 

Debt is detailed as follows: 

1 

Borrowings on the bank line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term debt otherwise.  

2 

The effective interest rate is the spread over LIBOR as of the most recent balance sheet date.  

3 

Non-publicly traded debt.  

4 

The unamortized deferred gain was realized upon the August 2011 settlement of interest rate swaps as described in Note 6.  

Our total   long-term   debt    -   book value   is presented in the table above net of unamortized discounts from par, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized deferred interest rate swap settlement gain. Discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective notes resulting in   $  3,320,000   of net interest expense for these items for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The estimated fair value of our debt presented in the table above was determined by: (1) averaging several asking price quotes for the publicly traded notes and (2) assuming par value for the remainder of the debt. The fair value estimates for the publicly traded notes were based on Level 2 information (as defined in Note 5) as of their respective balance sheet dates. 

12   

LINE OF CREDIT 

In   June 2015, we cancelled our secured   $500,000,000   line of credit and entered into a  n   unsecured   $750,000,000   line of credit   (incurring   $2,589,000   of transaction fees)  . 

Th  e l  ine of credit agreement expires in   June 2020   and contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for an unsecured facility. The primary negative covenant limits our ability to incur secured deb  t. The financial covenants are:   (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA of   3.5  :1, and   (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense of   3.0  :1.   As of September 30, 2016, we were   in   compliance with the line of credit covenants. 

Borrowings on our line of credit are classified as short-term debt if we intend to repay with  in   twelve months and as long-term debt if we have the intent and ability to extend   re  payment beyond twelve months.   Borrowings bear interest, at our option, at either LIBOR plus a credit margin ranging from   1.00%   to   2.00%  , or SunTrust Bank s base rate (generally, its prime rate) plus a credit margin ranging from   0.00%   to   1.00%  . The credit margin for both LIBOR and base rate borrowings is determined by either our ratio of debt to EBITDA or our credit ratings, based on the metric that produces the lower credit spread. Standby letters of credit, which are issued under the line of credit and reduce availability, are charged a fee equal to the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings plus   0.175%  . We also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit that ranges from   0.10%   to   0.35%   determined by either our ratio of debt to EBITDA or our credit ratings, based on the metric that produces the lower fee. As of September 30, 2016, the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings was   1.25  %  , the credit margin for base rate borrowings was   0.25  %  , and the commitment fee for the unused amount was   0.15  %  . 

As of September 30, 2016, our available borrowing capacity was   $  475,160,  000  . Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows: 

TERM DEBT 

All of our term debt is unsecured. All such debt, other than the   $  484,000   of other notes, is governed by two essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. The primary covenant in both indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt. As of September 30, 2016, we were   in   compliance with all of the term debt covenants. 

In December 2015, we repaid our   $150,000,000     10.125%   notes due   2015   via borrowing on our line of credit. In August 2015, we repaid our   $14,000,000   industrial revenue bond due   2022   via borrowing on our line of credit. These repayments did not incur any prepayment penalties. 

In March 2015, we issued   $400,000,000   of   4.50%   senior notes due   2025  . Proceeds (net of underwriter fees and other transaction costs) of   $395,207,000   were partially used to fund the March 30, 2015 purchase, via tender offer, of   $127,303,000   principal amount (  32%  ) of the   7.00%   notes due   2018  . The March 2015 debt purchase cost   $145,899,000  , including an   $18,140,000   premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs of   $456,000  . The premium primarily reflects the trading price of the notes relative to par prior to the tender offer commencement. Additionally, we recognized   $3,138,000   of net noncash expense associated with the acceleration of a proportional amount of unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred interest rate derivative settlement gains and losses. The combined first quarter 2015 charge of   $21,734,000     was   a component of interest expense for the nine month  s   ended September 30, 2015. 

The remaining net proceeds from the March 2015 debt issuance, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our line of credit, funded: (1) the April 2015 redemption of   $218,633,000   principal amount (  100%  ) of the   6.40%   notes due   2017  , (2) the April 2015 redemption of   $125,001,000   principal amount (  100%  ) of the   6.50%   notes due   2016   and (3) the April 2015 purchase, via the tender offer commenced in March 2015 of   $185,000   principal amount (less than   1%  ) of the   7.00%   notes due   2018  . The April 2015 debt purchases cost   $385,024,000  , including a   $41,153,000   premium above the principal amount of the notes and transaction costs of   $52,000  . The premium primarily reflects the make-whole value of the 2016 notes and the 2017 notes. Additionally, we recognized   $4,136,000   of net noncash expense associated with the acceleration of unamortized discounts, deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred interest rate derivative settlement gains and losses. The combined second quarter 2015 charge of   $45,341,000   was a component of interest expense for the nine month  s   ended September 30, 2015.

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT 

We provide, in the normal course of business, certain third-party beneficiaries with standby letters of credit to support our obligations to pay or perform according to the requirements of an underlying agreement. Such letters of credit typically have an initial term of   one   year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified or cancelled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our standby letters of credit are issued by banks that participate in our   $750,000,000   line of credit, and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder. Our standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2016 are summarized by purpose in the table below: 

Note 8: Commitments and Contingencies 

As summarized by purpose directly above in Note 7, our standby letters of credit totaled   $  39,840,000   as of   September   30, 2016. 

As described in Note 9, our asset retirement obligations totaled   $  214,686,000     as of September 30, 2016. 

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally, we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. 

We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period. 

We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with precision the outcome, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels. 

In addition to these lawsuits in which we are involved in the ordinary course of business, other material legal proceedings are more specifically described below. 

Lower Passaic River Study Area (Superfund Site)     The Lower Passaic River Study Area is part of the Diamond Shamrock Superfund Site in New Jersey. Vulcan and approximately 70 other companies are parties (collectively the Cooperating Parties Group) to a May 2007 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with the EPA to perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (draft RI/FS) of the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River (River). However, before the draft RI/FS was issued in final form, the EPA issued a record of decision (ROD) in March 2016 that calls for a bank-to-bank dredging remedy for the lower 8 miles of the River. The EPA estimates that the cost of implementing this proposal is $1.38 billion.   In September 2016, t  he EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with Occidental Chemical Corporation (Occidental) in which Occidental agreed to undertake   the remedial design for   this bank-to-bank dredging remedy, and to reimburse the United States for certain response costs.     

14   

Efforts to remediate the River have been underway for many years and have involved hundreds of entities that have had operations on or near the River at some point during the past several decades.   Vulcan formerly owned a chemicals operation near the mouth of the River, which was sold in 1974. The major risk drivers in the River have been identified as dioxins, PCBs, DDx and mercury. Vulcan did not manufacture any of these risk drivers and has no evidence that any of these were discharged into the River by Vulcan. 

The AOC does not obligate us to fund or perform the remedial action contemplated by either the draft RI/FS or the ROD. Furthermore, the parties who will participate in funding the remediation and their respective allocations, have not been determined. Vulcan does not agree that a bank-to-bank remedy is warranted, and Vulcan is not obligated to fund any of the remedial action at this time; nevertheless, we previously estimated the cost to be incurred by   us   as a potential participant in   a bank-to-bank dredging remedy and recorded an immaterial loss for this matter in 2015. 

TEXAS BRINE MATTER   During the operation of its former Chemicals Division, Vulcan was the lessee to a salt lease from 1976   2005 in an underground salt dome formation in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. The Texas Brine Company (Texas Brine) operated this salt mine for the account of Vulcan. Vulcan sold its Chemicals Division in 2005 and assigned the lease to the purchaser, and Vulcan has had no association with the leased premises or Texas Brine since that time. In August 2012, a sinkhole developed near the salt dome and numerous lawsuits were filed in state court in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Other lawsuits, including class action litigation, were also filed in August 2012 in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans.     

There   are numerous defendants to the litigation in state and federal court. Vulcan was first brought into the litigation as a third-party defendant in August 2013 b  y T  exas Bri  ne  . Vulcan has since been added as a direct and third-party defendant by other parties, including a direct claim by the   s  tate of Louisian  a. The d  amages alleged in the litigation range from individual plaintiffs  claims for property damage, to the   s  tate of Louisiana s claim for response costs, to claims for physical damages to oil pipelines, to business interruption claims  . In addition to the plaintiffs  claims, Vulcan has also been sued for contractual indemnity and comparative fault by both Texas Brine and   Occidental  .    The total amount of damages claimed is in excess of   $500   million.   It is alleged that the sinkhole was caused, in whole or in part, by Vulcan s negligent actions or failure to act. It is also alleged that Vulcan breached the salt lease, as well as an operating agreement   and a drilling agreement   with Texas Brin  e; that Vulcan is strictly liable for certain property damages in its capacity as a former assignee of the salt lease; and that Vulcan violated certain covenants and conditions in the agreement under which it sold its Chemicals Division in 2005. Vulcan has made claims for contractual indemnity, comparative fault, and breach of contract against Texas Brine, as well as claims for contractual indemnity and comparative fault against Occidental. Discovery is ongoing and the first trial date in any of these cases has been set for March 2017.     At this time, w  e cannot reasonably estimate   a range of   liability   pertaining   to this matter. 

HEWITT LANDFILL MATTER   (SUPERFUND SITE)     In September 2015, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) issued a Cleanup and Abatement Order (CAO) directing Vulcan to assess, monitor, cleanup and abate wastes that have been discharged to soil, soil vapor, and/or groundwater at the former Hewitt Landfill in Los Angeles. The CAO follows a 2014 Investigative Order from the RWQCB that sought data and a technical evaluation regarding the Hewitt Landfill, and a subsequent amendment to the Investigative Order requiring Vulcan to provide groundwater monitoring results to the RWQCB and to create and implement a work plan for further investigation of the Hewitt Landfill. In April 2016, Vulcan submitted an interim remedial action plan (IRAP) to the RWQCB, proposing a pilot test of a pump and treat system; testing and implementation of a leachate recovery system; and storm water capture and conveyance improvements. Until this pilot testing and additional investigative work is complete, we are unable to estimate the cost of remedial action.     

Vulcan is   also   engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the   EPA  , the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and other stakeholders regarding   the potential contribution of the Hewitt Landfill to   groundwater contamination in the   North Hollywood Operable Unit (NHOU) of the   San Fernando Valle  y Superfund Site. W  e are gathering and analyzing data and deve  loping techni  cal information to determine the extent of possible contribution by the Hewitt Landfill to the groundwater contamination in the area. This work is also intended to assist in identification of other   PRPs that may have contributed to groundwater contamination in the area  .    In July 2016, the EPA sent a letter to Vulcan requesting that we enter into an AOC for remedial design work at the NHOU including, but not limited to, the design of   two     or more   groundwater extraction wells   to be located   south of   the Hewitt Landfil  l.   I  n   September 2016, Vulcan sent a letter to the EPA agreeing to negotiate an AOC and develop a remedial design.   T  he estimated costs to develop the remedial design were   immaterial and   accrued in the third quarter  , and w  e   expect negotiation of the AOC to begin   in the fourth quarter of 201  6. 

15   

It is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these and other legal proceedings in which we are involved, and a number of factors, including developments in ongoing discovery or adverse rulings, or the verdict of a particular jury, could cause actual losses to differ materially from accrued costs.   No   liability was recorded for claims and litigation for which a loss was determined to be only reasonably possible or for which a loss could not be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in defense of lawsuits are expensed as incurred. In addition, losses on certain claims and litigation described above may be subject to limitations on a per occurrence basis by excess insurance, as described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Note 9: Asset Retirement Obligations 

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets. 

Recognition of a liability for an ARO is required in the period in which it is incurred at its estimated fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. If the ARO is settled for something other than the carrying amount of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss on settlement. 

We record all AROs for which we have legal obligations for land reclamation at estimated fair value. Essentially all these AROs relate to our underlying land parcels, including both owned properties and mineral leases. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, we recognized ARO operating costs related to accretion of the liabilities and depreciation of the assets as follows: 

ARO operating costs are reported in cost of revenues. AROs are reported within other noncurrent liabilities in our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Reconciliations of the carrying amounts of our AROs are as follows: 

The liabilities incurred   for 2015   noted above relate to the acquisition  s   in Arizona and New Mexico as described in Note 16.     T  he net revisions relate to revised cost estimates and spending patterns for several quarries located primarily in California.  

16   

Note 10: Benefit Plans 

We sponsor   three     qualified  , noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees hired prior to July 2007, other than those covered by union-administered plans. Normal retirement age is 65, but the plans contain provisions for earlier retirement. Benefits for the Salaried Plan and the Chemicals Hourly Plan are generally based on salaries or wages and years of service; the Construction Materials Hourly Plan provides benefits equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service. In addition to these qualified plans, we sponsor   three   unfunded, nonqualified pension plans. 

Effective July 2007, we amended our defined benefit pension plans to no longer accept new participants. In December 2013, we amended our defined benefit pension plans so that future service accruals for salaried pension participants ceased effective December 31, 2013. This change included a special transition provision which allowed covered compensation through December 31, 2015 to be considered in the participants  benefit calculations. 

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic pension benefit cost: 

The 2015 settlement charge noted above relates to a lump sum payment to a former employee from the nonqualified plan. Thi  s c  harge is reflected within both cost of revenues, and selling, administrative and general expenses in our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement  s   of Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The contributions to pension plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, pertain to benefit payments under the nonqualified plans.   We do not expect to be required to make     contributions to the qualified plans through 2017. 

In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage cost at the 2015 level. Substantially all of our salaried employees and, where applicable, certain of our hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits terminate when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age   65  , whichever occurs first. 

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost: 

17   

Note 11: other Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income comprises two subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). The components of other comprehensive income are presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, net of applicable taxes. 

Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax, are as follows: 

Changes in AOCI, net of tax, for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 are as follows: 

Amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings, are as follows: 

1  

Total for nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the acceleration of a proportional amount of deferred losses on interest rate derivatives (see Note 6) referable to debt purchases (see Note 7).          

2  

Totals for   the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015 include a one-time settlement loss resulting from a lump sum payment to a former employee (see Note 10).          

18   

Note 12: Equity 

Our capital stock consists solely of common stock, par value   $1.00   per share. Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Our Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes preferred stock of which   no   shares have been issued. The terms and provisions of such shares will be determined by our Board of Directors upon any issuance of preferred shares in accordance with our Certificate of Incorporation. 

Changes in total equity are summarized below: 

There were   no   shares held in treasury as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015. Stock purchases were as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016,   1,756,757   shares may b  e p  urchased under the current purchase authorization of our Board of Directors. 

19   

Note 13: Segment Reporting 

We have   four   operating (and   reportable  ) segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. The vast majority of our activities are domestic. We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside the United States. Intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of product utilized in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Management reviews earnings from the product line reporting segments principally at the gross profit level. 

segment financial disclosure 

1 

Includes crushed stone, sand and gravel, sand, other aggregates, as well as freight, delivery and transportation revenues, and other revenues related to services.  

2 

Certain temporarily idled assets are included within a segment's Identifiable Assets but the associated DDA A is shown within Other in the DDA A section above as the related DDA A is excluded from segment gross profit.  

20   

Note 14: Supplemental Cash Flow Information 

Supplemental information referable to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is summarized below: 

Note 15: Goodwill 

Goodwill is recognized when the consideration   paid   for a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. There were   no   charges for goodwill impairment in the   nine   month periods ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015. 

We have   four   reportable segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment from December 31, 2015 to   September   30, 2016 are summarized below: 

GOODWILL 

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. A decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill. 

Note 16: Acquisitions and Divestitures 

ACQUISITIONS 

Through the   nine   months   ended   September   30  , 2016, we purchased the   following for   $  1,611,000   of cash consideration: 

assets of a trucking business to complement our aggregates logistics and distribution activities     

For the full year 2015, we purchased the following for total consideration of   $47,198,000    (  $27,198,000   cash and   $20,000,000   exchanges of real property and businesses (twelve California ready-mixed concrete operations)): 

one   aggregates facility in Tennessee     

three   aggregates facilities and   seven   ready-mixed concrete operations in Arizona and New Mexico     

thirteen   asphalt mix   operations  , primarily in Arizona     

O  n September 30, 2016  ,   we funded a $19,500,000 acquisition that closed on Saturday, October 1, 2016. This payment is   reflected     in   prepaid assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

21   

DIVESTITURES AND PENDING DIVESTITURES 

As noted above, in 2015 (first quarter), we exchanged   twelve   ready-mixed concrete operations in California (representing all of our California concrete operations) for thirteen asphalt mix plants (primarily in Arizona) resulting in a pretax gain of   $5,886,000  . 

No   assets met the criteria for held for sale at   September   30  , 20  16  , December 31, 2015 or   September   30  , 2015. 

Note 17: New Accounting Standards 

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED 

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE INVESTMENTS        During the first quarter of 2016  , we adopted A  ccounting   S  tandards   U  pdate (ASU)   201  5  -  07  ,    Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)  .  This ASU   removed the requirement to categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy when their fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.   This ASU also removed the requirement to make certain disclosures for investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient.   The impact of this standard is limited to   o  ur annual     pension plan fair value disclosures  . 

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION 

C  ASH FLOW CLASSIFICATION  In August 2016, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board   (FASB) issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which amends guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU adds or clarifies guidance on eight specific cash flow issues  .   ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2017,   and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted.   We   do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

CREDIT LOSSES  In June 2016, the   F  A  SB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  which amends guidance on the impairment of   financial instruments. The new guidance   estimates credit losses   based on expected losses, modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.     ASU 2016-13   is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 201  9  , and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted   for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018  .    While w  e are   still   evaluating the impact   of ASU 2016-13, we do not expect   the adoption of this standard   to   have   a material impact   on our consolidated financial statements. 

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions.   Most significantly, e  ntities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled (i.e., the use of APIC pools will be eliminated). Additionally, the guidance   requires cash paid for shares withheld (  to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation  ) to be presented as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows  . This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2016  , and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted.   While we are still quantifying the impact of ASU 2016-09, we expect that the elimination of APIC pools will significantly impact our provision for income taxes. Likewise, we expect the requirement to classify     cash paid for shares withheld   as a financing activity will significantly impact our operating and financing cash flows. 

LEASE ACCOUNTING    In February 2016, the   FASB   issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting and adds additional disclosures about leasing arrangements.   Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement   and presentation of cash flow in the statement of cash flows  .    This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods   beginning   after December 15, 201  8  ,   and   interim reporting periods   within those annual reporting periods  . Early adoption is permitted   and modified retrospective application is required.     We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

22   

CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which amends certain aspects of current guidance on the recognition, measurement and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other changes, this ASU requires most equity investments be measured at fair value. Additionally, the ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for instruments not recognized at fair value in our financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitte  d. W  e do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

INVENTORY MEASUREMENT  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market principle to the lower of cost and net realizable value principle. The guidance applies to inventories that are measured using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost method, but does not apply to inventories that are measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory method. We use the LIFO method for approximately   67  %   of our inventory (based on the December 31, 201  5   balances); therefore, this ASU will not apply to the majority of our inventory. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting   periods. We   will adopt this standard as of and for the interim period ending March 31, 2017. While we are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-11, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

GOING CONCERN  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern (meet its obligations as they become due) within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, certain disclosures are required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods   thereafter. We   do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU      2014-09,  Revenue From Contracts With Customers,  which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This ASU provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues and expands required revenue recognition disclosures.   In March 2016  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,      Revenue From Contracts With Customers: Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),  which amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 provide guidance on recording revenue on a gross basis versus a net basis based on the determination of whether an entity is a principal or an agent when another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer. These   ASU  s     are   effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.   Further, in applying these ASUs an entity is permitted to use either the full retrospective or cumulative effect transition approach.   We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this   standard   on our consolidated financial statements   and determining our transition method  .

ITEM 2 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL COMMENTS 

Overview 

Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the U.S. economy. We   operate primarily in the U.S. and   are the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates    (  primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel  ) and a   major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete  .     O  ur principal product   aggregates   is used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.    

Demand for our products   is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment  . The primary end uses include public construction, such as highways, bridges, airports, schools and prisons, as well as private nonresidential (e.g., manufacturing, retail, offices, industrial and institutional) and private residential construction (e.g., single-family houses, duplexes, apartment buildings and condominiums). Customers for our products include heavy construction and paving contractors; commercial building contractors; concrete products manufacturers; residential building contractors; state, county and municipal governments; railroads and electric utilities. 

A  ggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials  , rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials  . Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available hig  h  -  q  uality aggregates. We serve these markets from   quarries that have access to long-haul transportation       shipping by ba  rge and rail   and from our quarry on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula   with our fleet of   Panamax-class, self-unloading ships. 

There are practically no substitutes for quality aggregates. Because of barriers to entry created   in many metropolitan markets   by zoning and permitting regulation and because of high transportation costs relative to the value of the product, the location of reserves is a critical factor to   our   long-term success. 

N  o material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business. In 201  5  , our five largest customers accounted for   7.0  % of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than   2.3  %     of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governmen  ts. 

While aggregates is our   focus and   primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and   ready-mixed   concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns. We produce and sell asphalt mix and  /or   ready-mixed concrete primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Georgi  a  ,     S  outhwestern and   W  estern markets. Aggregates comprise approximately 95  % of asphalt mix by weight and   8  0  % of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In   both   of these downstream businesse  s, a  ggregates   are primarily supplied   from our own operations. 

Seasonality and cyclical nature of our business 

Almost all our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions  ,     d  emographic and population fluctuation  s,   and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Financial highlights for   third     Quarter 201  6 

Compared to   third     quarter 201  5  :    

Freight-adjusted sales price   increased   7  %     

Incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues was   91  %     

Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium segmen  t g  ross profit improved     $2.0 million  , or     5  %,   to     $  42.4     million, collectively     

Selling, Administrative and General (SAG)   increased    $  4.9   million and     increase  d    0.7     percentage points   (  70   basis points)   as a percentage of total revenues  , due mainly to the amount and timing of spending for certain business initiatives     

Discrete items in the   third   quarter   of 201  6   include:     

a $6.5 million tax benefit related to utilization of foreign tax credits     

a pretax charge of $  1.1   million   primarily related to environmental matters referable to divested assets     

a pretax gain of $0.2 million for business interruption claims  , net of incentives     

Discrete items in the   third   quarter   of 201  5   include:     

a $4.7 million tax benefit relate  d   to   the partial release of   a state NOL carryforward valuation allowance     

a pretax charge of $  4.2   million   primarily related to environmental matters referable to divested assets     

a pretax charge of $  0.4   million for restructuring     

Our third quarter results reflect continued strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite lower shipment levels  . S  lower than expected large project starts and extremely wet   weather   i  mpacted   shipments in several key markets throughout the quarter. Compared with the prior year s third quarter, aggregates shipments declined 2.3 million tons, or 4%,   while   aggregates pricing increased $0.79 per ton, or 7%. Third quarter Aggregates segment gross profit grew 4%  , despite slightly lower segment sales. Net earnings for the third quarter increased 13% and Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% versus the prior year as gross profit margins improved in the Aggregates   and Asphalt Mix   segments. 

For the trailing twelve months, net earnings were $371.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $980.7 mil  lion, which represent gains of 118% and 28%, respectively, over the   comparable prior period. Aggregates shipments for this period grew 5%, and pricing increased   8%. 

Core profitability in our business continues to   strengthen  , despite   recent   volume headwinds in   certain   markets. So far this year, weather patterns and the timing of large project activity have led to higher month-to-month and state-to-state variability in our shipments, somewhat ma  s  king the   continu  ing   recovery in demand for construction materials across our footprint.   However, our unit margins continue to improve. Per-ton gross profit in our Aggregates segment grew by 9% in the third quarter despite lower shipments and uneven prod  uction schedules. Year-to-date per-ton gross profit has improved by 22%. As a result, we remain on track to reach the low     end of our 2016 profit plan despite shipments well below beginning-of  -  year expectations.   C  onsistent with   communications during our   late September   investor event in Atlanta  , we expect full year   2016    A  djusted EBITDA of   $1   billio  n,   a 20% increase   over   the prior   year.     Longer-term project pipelines a  re   healthy, and the foundations for sustained, multi-year volume and pricing growth remain in place.  

At the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was approximately   $  2 billion, including $235.0 million of floating-rate borrowings. The quarter  -  end cash balance was   $135.4 million. 

25   

As of September 30, cash capital expenditures were $287.4 million, including $83.6 million invested in the purchase of two replacement ships to transport aggregates from ou  r    q  uarry in Mexico, as well as new site development and investment in other growth opportunities. For the full year, core capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $275 million. Internal growth capital investments, excluding acquisitions, are expected to be approximately $125 million  

During the first nine months of 2016, we returned $241.3 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.   Year-to-date, w  e repurchased approximately 1.4 million share  s    at an average cost of $113.18 per share. 

The strong fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business and the outstanding improvement in our core profitability have led to strong earnings growth through the first nine months of 2016   despite slower than expected volume growth  . Unit profitability continues to improve and incremental margins remain strong across our businesses.   The core drivers of a continu  ing   recovery in shipments remain firmly in place, with higher levels of publicly-funded construction activity just beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand.   The pricing environment remains   favorable  . Construction starts in our markets strengthened in August and September after weakening for several months. Although it is too soon to issue firm guidance, at this point we would expect to see broad-based volume and pricing growth accompanied by continued margin expansion in 2017. 

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

Gross profi  t    margin   excluding freight and delivery   revenues   is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure. We present   this metric   as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. Likewise, we believe that this presentation is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent pass-through activities. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: 

gross profit margin in accordance with gaap 

gross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues

Includes freight to remote distribution sites.  

26   

Aggregates segment gross profi  t    margin   a  s a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues is not a   GAAP   measure. We present   this metric   as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation   is meaningful   to our investors as it excludes   freight, delivery and   transportation revenue  s, w  hich are   pass-through activit  ies  .   It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business.     Incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in freight-adjusted revenues. Reconciliation  s   of these   metric  s to their   nearest GAAP measure  s are   presented below:

At the segment level, freight, delivery and transportation revenues include intersegment freight   delivery revenues, which are eliminated at the consolidated level.  

27   

GAAP   does not defin  e "c  ash gross profit" and  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization  (EBITDA). Thu  s, c  ash gross profit and EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined   by GAAP. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment   professionals who use such metrics in their   analyses     and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company's ab  ility to incur and service debt and to assess the operating performance of a company s businesses.   We us  e c  ash gross profit   and   EBITDA to assess the operating performance of our variou  s business units and the consolidated company.   Additionally, we adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to   period  .    We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below: 

cash gross profit 

Cash gross profit   adds back noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization (DDA A) to gross profit.   Cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing cash gross profit by tons shipped. 

28   

EBITDA and adjusted ebitda 

EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation   and   Amortization     and excludes discontinued operations  .     We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period. 

Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 has been re  vised   to con  form with the 2016 presentation   which no longer includes an adjustment for amortization of deferred revenue.     Adjusting for this item is no longer meaningful as all periods presented include amortization of deferred revenue at amounts that are substantially equivalent. 

A reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not available without unreasonable effort. We are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the outcome of legal proceedings, charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures, impairment of long-lived assets and other unusual gains and losses. 

29   

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Total revenues include sales of products to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers. Related freight and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues.   This presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review   our consolidated   results of operations. We discuss separately our discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business. 

The following table highlights significant components of our consolidated operating results including    E  BITDA   and Adjusted EBITDA  .

third   quarter 2016 Compared to   third   Quarter 2015 

Third   quarter 201  6   total revenues were $  1,008.1     million,   down     3  %   from the   third   quarter of 201  5  . Shipments   de  creased in aggregates (  -4  %)  , asphalt mix (  -11  %)   and   ready-mixed conc  rete     (  less than -1  %).   Diesel fuel expenditures were   $  3.6   million   lower  , with most of this benefit realized in the Aggregates segme  nt. 

Net earnings for the   third   quarter of   201  6     were     $  139.8     million, or $  1.04     per diluted share, compared to $  123.8   million, or $0.  91   per diluted share, in the   third     quarter of 201  5  . Each period s results were impacted by discrete items, as follows: 

Net earnings for th  e    third     quarter of   2016   include   pretax charges of $1.1 million associated with acquisitions and divestitures, which w  as   more than offset by a $6.5 million tax benefit related to utilization of foreign tax credits   and a pretax gain of $0.2 million for business interruption claims (net of incentives)     

Net earnings for the   third   quarter of   201  5   include   pretax charges of $  4.2   million associated with   acquisitions and divestitures and   a $  0.4   million pretax charge for restructuring  , which were more than offset by a $4.7 million tax benefit related to   the partial release of a state NOL carryforward valuation allowance     

Continuing Operations     Changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the   third     quarter of 201  6   versus the   third   quarter of 201  5   are summarized below: 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 

Aggregates segment sales were $821.8 million, down 1%, from the prior year s third quarter while aggregates fr  e  ight-adjusted revenues were $641.1 million, up 2%. Third quarter aggregates shipments decreased 4%, or 2.3 million tons, compared to the third quarter of 201  5.   A   slow  -  down in trailing twelve month construction starts that began in March,   t  he timing of   certain   large projects  , and   w  eather patterns   led to highly variable third quarter shipment results across our markets  .    A  rizona, Florida, Georgia and North Carolin  a     saw shipment increase  s   of between 12% and 21%  . In contrast,   California,   Illinois   and   Texas   experienced shipment declines of between 16% and 21%. Weather and other factors impacted shipments most severely during the month of August, with   total   shipments declining 8% from 2015 levels. During August, shipments in Texas fell over 30% relative to the prior year, shipments in Illinois fell over 20%  ,   and shipments in Louisiana fell almost 40%. 

For the trailing twelve months, shipments rose 5% over the   comparable   prior period. Despite these recent gains, demand for aggregates remains well below   levels consistent with   demographic   growth   in the U.S. We believe conditions remain in place for a sustained, multi-year recovery in demand for aggregates, although quarter-to quarter trends may vary significantly. 

For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales price for aggregates increased 7%, or $0.79 per ton, versus the prior year. On a trailing twelve months basis, pricing   in all of our major markets has increased versus the prior year s comparable period. The overall pricing climate remains favorable as   visibility to a sustained recovery improves and as   construction materials producers stay focused on earning adequate returns on capital.  

Third quarter unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted) in the Aggregates segment increased   5%   versus the prior year s third quarter. Excluding the benefits of lower unit costs for diesel fuel, unit costs were approximately   6  % higher in the quarter due   to   reduced   fixed cost absorption and other cost effects   of   lower volumes. For the trailing twelve months, unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted)  ,    excluding the impact of lower diesel costs, was   essentially flat  . 

31   

Aggregates segment unit margins continued to increase, including in key markets challenged by recent weakness in shipping rates. Gross profit per ton increased $0.44, or 9%, from the prior year s third quarter. On a trailing twelve months basis, unit gross profit has increased 25%, to $4.89 per ton, while unit cash gross profit has increased 19% to $6.17 per ton. 

For the quarter, our Aggregates segment gross profit flow-through rate was strong due to solid price growth and a   continu  ing   commitment to plant-level cost controls and operating disciplines.   Freight adjusted revenues increased $12.0 million, while gross profit for the segment increased $10.9 million. Incremental gross profit was 91% of incremental freight-adjusted revenues.   Because quarterly   results can vary significantly due to seasonality and other factors, we encourage investors to also consider longer-term trends. On a trailing twelve months same-store basis, this flow-through rate has consistently exceeded our stated goal of 60% beginning in the first quarter of 2014. 

Asphalt Mix segment gross profit was $  32.9   million   in the   third   quarter of 2016   versus $  30.0   million in the prior year.   Volumes decreased 11% due to the same factors impacting the Aggregates segment noted above. However,   solid sales and operating disciplines as well as effective materials margin management   offset the   earning  s   effect of the   drop in volume  . 

Concrete segment gross profit was $  8.7   million   compared to    $  9.6   million in the prior year s   third     quarter.   Sales volumes were flat versus the prior year as   higher volumes in Arizona and Georgia helped offset   lower volumes in   Maryland, Texas and   Virginia.   Unit   gross profit was slightly lower versus   the prior year     period     due primarily to   unfavorable impact from geographic mix  . 

Our Calcium segment reported gross profit of $  0.8   million   in the   third   quarter of 2016  ,    in line with the   prior   year   s third quarter  . 

SAG expenses   increased $4.9 million versus the prior year. The year-over-year increase   resulted primarily from   spending for initiatives to improve business processes and investments   to enhance sales initiatives. For the year, SAG expense should approximate $310 million. 

Gain on sale of property, plant   equipment and businesses   was   $  2.0    m  illion in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to $0.  8   million in the   third   quarter of 2015  . 

There were no r  estructuring charges     in the   third     quarter of 201  6   compared to   $  0.4   million   in the   third     quarter of 201  5  . See Note 1 to the condensed consolida  t  ed financial statements for an explanation of these costs. 

Other operating expense, generally consisting of various cost items not included in cost of revenues, was $  3.5    m  illion   in the   third   quarter of 2016   versus $  8.0   million in the   third     quarter of 201  5  . 

Net interest expense was $  33.1   million in the   third   quarter of 201  6   compared to $  37.8     million in 201  5  . 

I  ncome tax     expense   from continuing operations   was    $  52.1     million in the   third   quarter of 201  6   compared to $  45.4   million in the   third   quarter of 201  5  .    The   in  crease in our income tax expense resulted largely from   applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings. 

Earnings     from continuing operations were $  1.06   per diluted share   in the   third     quarter of 201  6     compared to $0.  93   per diluted share in the   third   quarter of 2015  . 

Discontinued Operations       Third   quarter pretax loss from discontinued operations was $  5.1     million in 2016 and $  4.0   million in 2015.   Both periods include   charges related to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals   business. For   additional details, see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

year-to-date   September   30, 2016 Compared to year-to-date   September   30, 2015 

T  otal revenues   for the first   nine   months of 2016   were $  2,719.7     million, up   6  % from the   first   nine   months   of 201  5  . Shipments increased in aggregates (+  4  %) and   ready-mixed conc  rete     (+  4  %) while they   were down in asphalt mix   (-  5  %).   Diesel fuel expenditures were   $  17.1   million   lower  , with most of this benefit realized in the Aggregates segme  nt. 

Net earnings for the first   nine   months   of   201  6     were     $  282.4     million, or $  2.09     per diluted share, compared to $  132.3   million, or $0.  98   per diluted share, in the   first   nine   months   of 201  5  . Each period s results were impacted by discrete items, as follows: 

Net earnings for th  e    first   nine   months   of   2016   include   pretax     charges of $  17.5   million associated with acquisitions and divestitures, pretax charges of $  10.5   million from asset impairment losses and a $  0.3   million pretax charge for restructuring  . These unfavorable items were more than offset by   a pretax gain of $  11.2   million from   business interruption claims     (net of incentives) and a $6.5 million tax benefit related to utilization of foreign tax credits     

Net earnings for the first   nine   months of   201  5   include   a pretax   loss   of $  3.3   million (net of $  9.3   million of charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures) related to the sale of real estate and businesses, a $4.  5   million pretax charge for restructuring, a $5.2 million pretax asset impairment loss, and a pretax loss on debt purchases of $67.1 million presented as a component of interest expense (see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements)  . These unfavorable items were partially offset by a $4.7 million tax benefit related to a   state NOL   valuation allowance   partial   release     

Continuing Operations     Changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for   year-to-date   September   30, 2016 versus year-to-date   September   30, 2015   are summarized below: 

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 

Gross profit for   our   Aggregates segment was $  664.2   million for the first   nine   months of 2016 versus $  525.8   million in 2015.   Aggregates segment   sales of $  2,248.2   million were   up   9  %  ,   while a  ggregates   f  reight-adjusted revenue  s    of    $  1,742.8   million   were   up   11  %  .    Year-to-date   aggregates shipment  s   increased   4  %, or   4.7   million tons, compared to the prior year       the level of increase   was   muted by wet weather and the timing of large projects in a number of our markets during the second   and third quarters   of 2016  .     Freight-adjusted   average sales price for aggregates increased   8  %, or $  0.88   per ton, versus the first   nine months   of 2015  ,    with all major markets realizing price improvement. Year-to-date unit cost of sales (freight-adjusted) in the Aggregates segmen  t was flat versus the first nine months of 2015; excluding the benefits of lower unit costs for diesel fuel, unit costs were   up 2%. Gross profit per ton increased $0.86, or 22%, from the prior year s first nine months.    

For the first   nine months of 2016  , our   Aggregates segment   gross profit flow-through   remained strong  . Freight-adjusted revenues increased   $  175.4     million, while gross profit for the segment increased $  138.3   million.   Thus, i  ncremental gross profit   was     79  %    of   incremental freight-adjusted revenues. 

Asphalt Mix segment gross profit   of    $  76.0   million was up $  16.1   million   from   the first   nine   months of   2015.   This improvement resulted from effective materials margin management as volume and pricing were down 5% and 1%, respectively. 

33   

Concrete segment gross profit was $  18.3   million for the first   nine   months of 2016, an improvement of $  3.1   million from the prior year.   This improvement resulted from increased r  eady-mix concrete volumes   (+  4  %  )   and pricing   (+  3  %  )  . 

Our Calcium segment report  ed   gross profit of $  2.6   million in the first   nine months   of 2016,   up slightly fr  o  m the $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2015. 

SAG expenses   increased $  28.1   million and   0.6   percentage points (  60   basis points) as a percentage of total revenues. The   increase was due   primarily   to   certain compensation-  r  ela  ted   charges in 2016 as a result of the significant improvement in our business performance and stock price, and investments to enhance our sales initiative  s  . 

Gain on sale of property, plant   equipment and businesses   was   $  2.9     million in the   first   nine   months   of 2016 compared to $  7.4   million in the first   nine   months   of 2015  . 

Our year-to-date September 2016 results include   a gain of   $  11.7   million   r  elated to   the settlement of   18   of 22   business interruption claims     from the 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill  . 

We recorded $  10.5   million and $5.2 million of losses on impairment of long-lived assets for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  .    During the second quarter of 2016, we wrote off   $0.9 million of   nonrecoverable   project   costs related to two   Aggregates segment   capital projects that we no longer intend to complet  e.   D  uring the first quarter of 2016, we terminated a no  n  -  s  trategic aggregates site lease we no longer intend  ed   to develop resulting in a $9.6 million charge for   impairment of long-lived assets  . D  uring the second quarter of 2015, we   did not renew a  n Aggregates segment   lease on a land parcel in California resulting in a $5.2 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets related to the associated reclamation obligation   (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). 

Restructuring charges     were $  0.3     million in the   first   nine   months   of 201  6   compared to   $  4.  5   million   in the   first   nine   months   of 201  5  . See Note 1 to the condensed consolida  t  ed financial statements for an explanation of these costs. 

Other operating expense, generally consisting of various cost items not included in cost of revenues, was $  23.6     million   in the   first   nine   months   of 2016   versus $  17.2   million in the   first   nine   months   of 201  5  .    The year-over-year   in  crease resulted mostly from $  16.7   million of the aforementioned $  17.5   million of discrete charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures (the remainder, $  0.8   million of business development costs, was charged to SAG expense). These discrete items are composed of charges associated with office space no longer needed and vacated ($  5.2   million), the write-off of a prepaid royalty asset resulting from a change in long-term mining plans ($  3.6   million), a property litigation settlement ($  1.9   million)  , a pension withdrawal settlement   revision   ($1.5 million)   and environmental liability accruals associated with previously divested properties ($  4.5   million  ). 

Net interest expense was $  100.2   million in the   first   nine   months   of 201  6   compared to $  1  83.9     million in 201  5  .     The lower interest expense   is due   mostly   to   the   2015   debt refinancing   charges of $  67.1   million   described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

I  ncome tax     expense   from continuing operations   was    $  116.0     million in the   first     nine   months   of 201  6   compared to $  51.2   million in the   first     nine   months   of 201  5  .    The   in  crease in our income tax expense   resulted largely from applying the statutory rate to the increase in our pretax earnings. 

Earnings     from continuing operations were $  2.14   per diluted share   in the   first   nine   months   of 201  6     compared to $  1.03   per diluted share in the   prior year  . 

Discontinued Operations       Year-to-date   September   pretax loss from discontinued operations was $  12.3     million in 2016 and $  11.6   million in 2015.   Both periods include   charges related to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals   business. For   additional details, see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY   AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities   and a substantial, committed bank line of credit.     A  dditional   sources of   capital   include   access to the capital markets, the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets.   We believe thes  e f  inancial resources a  re sufficient to fund our   business requirements   for 2016  , including  : 

cash contractual obligations     

capital expenditures     

debt service obligations     

di  vidend payments     

potential share repurchases     

potentia  l a  cquisitions     

We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles: 

maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity     

proactively manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low     

minimize   financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility     

opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable     

C  ash 

Included in our   September   30, 2016     cash and cash equivalents balance of $  135.4   million is $  56.7   million of cash held at one of our foreign   subsidiaries.   All   of this $  56.7   million of cash relates to earnings   that   are   indefinitely   reinvested offshore.   Use of this cash is currently limited to our foreign   operations. 

cash from operating activities 

1  

Primarily reflects changes to working capital balances.  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $  345.4     million during the   first   nine     months   of 2016  , $  64.1   million   higher than   the same period of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the $  150.1   million increase in net earnings  , $67.1 million of which was due to the 2015 charges associated with debt purchases   (see Note 7 to the condensed cons  olidated financial statements  )  .    Cash paid for this debt purchase is presented as a component of financing activitie  s  .    

35   

cash from investing activities 

Net cash used for investing activities was $  279.5     million during the first   nine   months of 2016, a $  48.1   million increase compared to t  he s  ame period of 2015. We invested $  287.4   millio  n i  n our existing operations in the first   nine months   of 2016, a $  72.6   million increase compared to the prior year. Of this $  287.4   million, $  83.6   million was invested in shipping capacity replacement, new site developments and other growth opportunities.     D  uring the   first nine months   of 2015  ,   we acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in Arizona and New Mexico   for $  20.8   million   of cash consideration  . 

cash from financing activities 

Net cash used for financing activities in the first   nine     months of 2016 was $  214.6   million, a  n     in  crease of $  192.1   million from the same period of 2015. This large   in  crease   was   primarily attributable   to a $  201.5   million increase in   return   of   capital to our investors   via   dividends and   share repurchase  s  .   Finally, there were no proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in 2016 (compared to $  67.9   million in the first   nine months   of 2015) as only stock-only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs) remained outstanding at the beginning of the   year  . 

debt 

Certain debt measures are outlined below: 

1  

Includes borrowings under our line of credit for which we have the intent and ability to extend payment beyond twelve months, as follows:   September   30  , 2016       $  235.0   million, December 31, 201  5       $  235.0   million and   September   30  , 2015       $  85  .0 million.   

2  

Reflects   the margin above   LIBOR for LIBOR-  based borrowings;   we also paid upfront fees that are amortized to interest expense and pay fees for unused borrowing capacity and standby letters of credit.  

Line of credit 

I  n June 2015, we cancelled our secured   $500.0 million line of   credit   and entered into a  n   unsecured $750.0 million line of credit     (incurring $2.6 million of transaction fees)  .    The expanded borrowing capacity is   a part of   the refinancing plans disclosed at our February 25, 2015 Investor Day     (  the 2015 refinancing plans  ).   Borrowings at   September   30  , 2016     are consistent with the 2015 refinancing plans and are intended to remain outstanding going forward  . 

Th  e l  ine of credit   agreement   expires in June 2020 and   contains   affirmative,   negative and financial covenants customary for an unsecured facility   (none of which materially impact our ability to execute our strategic, operating and financial plans). The financial covenants are  : (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA   of   3.5:1, and   (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense   of   3.0:1.   As of   September   30  , 2016  , we   were     in     compliance with   the   line of credit covenants.    

36   

Borrowings and other cost ranges and details are described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. As of   September   30  , 2016  , the credit margin for London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) borrowings was   1.25  %  , the credit margin for base rate borrowings was     0.25  %  ,   and the commitment fee   for the unused amount   was   0.15  %  . 

A  s of   Septembe  r     3  0  , 2016  , o  ur   available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $  475.2   million. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows: 

$  39.8   million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of   credit     

TERM DEBT 

All of o  u  r    term debt is   unsecured  .    All such debt, other than the $  0.  5   million of other notes  ,   is governed by two  ,   essentially identica  l i  ndentures that   contain customary investment-grade   type   covenants  . The primary covenant in both indentures limits   the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing   such   debt  .    As of   September   30  , 2016  , we were   in     compliance with all of the term debt covenants. 

In March  ,   April     and August   of 2015, we completed the refinancing of $  485.1   million principal amount of deb  t a  s described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.   And, in December 2015 we refinanced at maturity the $150.0 million of   10.125% notes via borrowings on our line of credit. These refinancing actions   were   consistent with the aforementioned 2015 refinancing plan  s a  nd   ha  d   the following benefits, among others: (1) eliminate  d   $621.1 million of debt maturities in 2015   2018, (2) extend  ed   the weighted-average life of our debt portfolio, and (3) lower  ed   our weighted-average   interest   rate. 

The   2015   refinancing actions resulted in charges totaling $67.1 million. Such charges are detailed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and   are     presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the   nine   month period ended   September   30  , 2015  . 

CURRENT MATURITIES of long-term debt 

The    $  0.1     million of   current maturities of long-term debt   as of   September   30  , 2016     includes all   long-term   deb  t    that   we   intend   to   pay within twelve months  , as described above,   and is due as follows: 

debt   ratings 

Our debt ratings and outlooks as of   September   30  , 2016   are   as follows  :

Equity 

Our common stock issuances   and purchases   are   as follows  : 

There were   no   shares held in treasury as of   September   30  , 20  16  ,   December 31, 201  5   and   September   30  , 201  5  . 

On February 10, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. As of   September   30  , 2016  , t  here were   1,756,757     shares remaining under th  e a  uthorization  . Depending upon market, business, legal and other conditions, we may make share purchases from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and/or plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The authorization has no time limit, does not obligate us to purchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time  . 

Our common stock purchases   (all of which were open market purchases) for the year-to-date periods ending are detailed below: 

off-balance sheet arrangements 

We have   no   off-balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities, that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our: 

results of operations and     financial position     

c  apital expenditures     

l  iquidity   and capital resources     

Standby Letters of Credit 

For a discussion of our standby letters of   credit, see     Note   7   to the condensed con  solidated financial statements. 

38   

Cash Contractual Obligations 

Our obligation to make future payments under contracts is presented in our most re  cent Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5   (Form 10-K). 

We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may   materially   differ from these estimates. 

We believe that the accounting policies described in the  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  section of our Form 10-K require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting   policies.   There have been no changes to our critical acco  unting policies during the   nine   mo  nths ended   September   30  , 2016  . 

new Accounting standards 

For a discussion of the accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption and the   e  ffect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see Note   17   to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT     MARKET RISK 

MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order to manag  e t  hese market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 

As discussed in the Liquidity and Financial Resources section of Part I, Item 2, we actively manage our capital structure and resources to balance the cost of capital an  d r  isk     of financial stress  . Such activity includes balancing the cost and risk of interest expense. In addition to floating-rate borrowings under our line of credit, we at times utilize interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed-  rate   and floating-rate debt. 

While floating-rate debt exposes us to rising interest rates, it is typically cheaper than issuing fixed-rate debt at any point in time   but can become more expensive than previously issued fixed-rate debt  . However, a rising interest rate environment is not necessarily harmful to our financial results. Since   200  2  , our EBITDA and Operating income   are   positively   correlated   to floating interest rates (as measured by 3-month LIBOR). As such, our business serves as a natural hedge to rising interest rates, and floating-rate debt serves as a natural hedge against weaker operating results   due to general economic weakness  . 

At     September   30  , 2016  ,   the estimated fair value of our long-term deb  t i  ncluding current maturities was $  2,305.2   million compared to a book value of $  1,983.8   million. The estimated fair value   (b  ased on information available as of the balance sheet dat  e)   was   determined by   averaging   several asking   price quotes for     the   publicly traded notes and assuming par value for the remainder of the deb  t.   A   decline in interest rates of   one   percentage point would increase the fair value of our   debt   by $  112.7   million. 

We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds   and   the expected return on plan   assets  . The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs is discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4 

controls and procedures 

disclosure controls and procedur  es 

We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securitie  s E  xchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a - 15(e)   or   15d - 15(e)), include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that   such   information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other management officials, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of   September   30  , 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures   were   effective   as of   September   30  , 2016  . 

No     material   changes were made   during the   third   quarter of 201  6     to our internal   con  trols ov  er financial reporting  , nor have there been other factors that materially affect these controls  .

ITEM 1 

legal proceedings 

Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  , and in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter  s   ended March 31, 2016   and June 30, 2016  . See   Note   8   to the condensed consolidated financial statements of   this   Form 10-Q for a discussion of certain recent developments   concerning our legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A 

risk factors 

In March 2016, two   (Standard   Poor s and Fitch)   of our three credit ratings were upgraded to investment-grade. Our current ratings make us less dependent on the noninvestment-grade debt market (which is more volatile than the investment-grade debt market  )  .    T  here   were   no     other   material   changes to the risk factors disclosed in   Part I  , Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  . 

ITEM 2 

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Purchases of our equity securities during the quarter ended   September   30  , 2016 are summarized below. 

1  

On February 10, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized us to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares. As of   September   30  , 2016, there were   1,756,757   shares remaining under the authorization. Depending upon market, business, legal and other conditions, we may make share purchases from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions and/or plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The authorization has no time limit, does not obligate us to purchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  

We   did   not   have any unregistered sales of equity securities during the   third   quarter of 201  6  .

msha citations and litigation 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted. Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires companies that are      operators      (as such term is defined in the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act)  )   to disclose certain mine safety information in each periodic report to the   Securities and Exchange   Commission. This information is related to the enforcement of the Mine Act by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). 

The Dodd-Frank Act   and the subsequent implementing regulation issued by the SEC   require disclosure of the following categories of violations, orders and citations: (1) Section 104 S S Citations, which are citations issued for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard; (2) Section 104(b) Orders, which are orders issued upon a follow up inspection where the inspector finds the violation previously cited has not been totally abated in the prescribed time period; (3) Section 104(d) Citations and Orders, which   are   issued upon violations of mandatory health or safety standards caused by an unwarrantable failure of the operator to comply with the standards; (4) Section 110(b)(2) Violations, which result from the reckless and repeated failure to eliminate a known violation; (5) Section 107(a) Orders, which are given when MSHA determines that an imminent danger exists and results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition; and (6) written notices from MSHA of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under Section 104(e). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the disclosure of the total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act and the total number of mining related fatalities. 

The following disclosures are made pursuant to Section 1503. 

During the three months ended   September   30  , 201  6  ,    none     of our operations:   (i) received any orders under Section 104(b), which are issued upon a follow up inspection where the inspector finds the violation previously cited has not been totally abated in the prescribed time period;   (ii  ) had any flagrant violations under Section 110(b)(2);   (iii) received any Section 107(a) Orders, which are given when MSHA determines than an imminent danger exists and results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition; (iv) received notice from MSHA of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(e).
