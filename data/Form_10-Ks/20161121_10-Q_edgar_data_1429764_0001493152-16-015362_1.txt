1.
BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS   

Car
Charging Group, Inc. ( CCGI ) was incorporated on October 3, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada as New Image
Concepts, Inc. On December 7, 2009, New Image Concepts, Inc. changed its name to Car Charging Group, Inc.  

CCGI,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  Car Charging ), acquires and installs
electric vehicle ( EV ) charging stations and shares servicing fees received from customers that use the charging
stations with the property owner(s), on a property by property basis. In addition, the Company sells hardware and enters into
individual arrangements for this purpose with various property owners, which may include municipalities, garage operators, hospitals,
multi-family properties, shopping malls and facility owner/operators.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required
by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The results of
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for
the full year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of the Company as of December
31, 2015 and for the year then ended, which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on Form
10-K on July 29, 2016.  

2.
GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S PLANS   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
a cash balance, a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit of $9,132, $22,166,473 and $82,527,579, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,408,156 and $9,154,924, respectively.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Since
inception, the Company s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds received in equity and debt financings.
Although management believes that the Company has access to capital resources, there are currently no commitments in place for
new financing at this time, except as described below, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. There is also no assurance that the amount of funds the Company might raise will
enable the Company to complete its development initiatives or attain profitable operations. If the Company is unable to obtain
additional financing on a timely basis, it may have to curtail its development, marketing and promotional activities, which would
have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately
the Company could be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate.  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might become necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.  

Subsequent
to September 30, 2016, the Company received an aggregate of $500,000 associated with the issuance of a note payable. In addition,
pursuant to the note, an additional $3,225,000 is payable to the Company upon the completion of certain milestones, as specified
in the note. See Note 11   Subsequent Events   Note Payable for additional details. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be successful in completing the milestones. The Company is currently funding its operations on a month-to-month
basis. While there can be no assurance that it will be successful, the Company is in active negotiations to raise additional capital.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

PRINCIPLES
OF CONSOLIDATION   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CCGI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Car Charging,
Inc., Beam Charging LLC ( Beam ), EV Pass LLC ( EV Pass ), Blink Network LLC ( Blink ) and
Car Charging China Corp. ( Car Charging China ). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.  

Through
April 16, 2014, 350 Green LLC ( 350 Green ) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in which the Company had
full control and was consolidated. Beginning on April 17, 2014, when 350 Green s assets and liabilities were transferred
to a trust mortgage, 350 Green became a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ). The consolidation guidance relating to accounting
for VIEs requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests
give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity and perform ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of 350 Green, and as such, 350
Green s assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

Preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the
financial statements. The Company s significant estimates used in these financial statements include, but are not limited
to, stock-based compensation, accounts receivable reserves, warranty reserves, inventory valuations, the valuation allowance related
to the Company s deferred tax assets, the carrying amount of intangible assets, estimates of future EV sales and the effects
thereon, and the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets. Certain of the Company s estimates could be affected
by external conditions, including those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that
these external factors could have an effect on the Company s estimates and could cause actual results to differ from those
estimates.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   

Accounts
receivable are carried at their contractual amounts, less an estimate for uncollectible amounts. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, there was an allowance for uncollectable amounts of $42,942 and $140,998, respectively. Management estimates
the allowance for bad debts based on existing economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers, and the amount and
age of past due accounts. Receivables are considered past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Past
due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for bad debts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted.  

INVENTORIES   

Inventory
is comprised of electric charging stations and related parts, which are available for sale or for warranty requirements. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventory that is sold to third
parties is included within cost of sales and inventory that is installed on the premises of participating owner/operator properties,
where the Company retains ownership, is transferred to fixed assets at the carrying value of the inventory. The Company periodically
reviews for slow-moving, excess or obsolete inventories. Products that are determined to be obsolete, if any, are written down
to net realizable value. Based on the aforementioned periodic reviews, the Company recorded an inventory reserve for slow-moving,
excess or obsolete inventories of $170,000 and $290,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s inventory was comprised solely of finished goods and parts that
are available for sale.  

FIXED
ASSETS   

Fixed
assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization which is recorded commencing at the in-service date
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Accumulated depreciation and amortization as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $4,609,576 and $4,100,163, respectively.

INTANGIBLE
ASSETS   

Intangible
assets were acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of Beam, EV Pass, and Blink during 2013 and were recorded at their fair
value at such time. Trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life of ten years. Patents are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the lives of the patent (twenty years or less), commencing when the patent is approved and placed
in service on a straight line basis. Accumulated amortization related to intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 was $31,181 and $23,445, respectively.  

DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify
as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ). The accounting treatment of derivative financial
instruments requires that the Company record the conversion options and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date
of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating,
non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. Conversion options are recorded as a discount
to the host instrument and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying instrument. The Company reassesses
the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events
during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.  

The
Binomial Lattice Model was used to estimate the fair value of the warrants that are classified as derivative liabilities on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value
estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of time equal to the weighted average
life of the warrants.  

SEQUENCING
POLICY   

Under
ASC 815-40-35, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy whereby, in the event that reclassification of contracts from equity
to assets or liabilities is necessary pursuant to ASC 815 due to the Company s inability to demonstrate it has sufficient
authorized shares, shares will be allocated on the basis of the earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments, with
the earliest grants receiving the first allocation of shares.  

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of ASC 820  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  

Level
2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  

Level
3   inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair values due to the short-term
nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s notes payable approximates fair value because the effective
yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates, taken together with other features such as concurrent issuance
of warrants, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk.

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable
and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the services have
been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
Accordingly, when a customer completes use of a charging station, the service can be deemed rendered and revenue may be recognized
based on the time duration of the session or kilowatt hours drawn during the session. Sales of EV stations are recognized upon
shipment to the customer, free on board shipping point, or the point of customer acceptance.  

Governmental
grants and rebates pertaining to revenues and periodic expenses are recognized as income when the related revenue and/or periodic
expense are recorded. Government grants and rebates related to EV charging stations and their installation are deferred and amortized
in a manner consistent with the related depreciation expense of the related asset over their useful lives.  

For
arrangements with multiple elements, which is comprised of (1) a charging unit, (2) installation of the charging unit, (3) maintenance
and (4) network fees, revenue is recognized dependent upon whether vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of
fair value exists for separating each of the elements. We determined that VSOE exists for both the delivered and undelivered elements
of our multiple-element arrangements. We limit our assessment of fair value to either (a) the price charged when the same element
is sold separately or (b) the price established by management having the relevant authority.  

CONCENTRATIONS   

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues generated from Entity C represented approximately 15% and 14%, respectively,
of the Company s total revenue. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, revenues generated from Entity
C represented approximately 15% and 15%, respectively, of the Company s total revenue. During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, revenues generated from Entity A represented approximately 22% of the Company s total revenue. The Company generated
grant revenues from governmental agencies (Entity A) and charging service revenues from a customer (Entity C).  

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION    

The
Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is
measured on the measurement date and re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period
is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange
for the award, usually the vesting period. Awards granted to non-employee directors for their service as a director are treated
on the same basis as awards granted to employees. The Company computes the fair value of equity-classified warrants and options
granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

NET
LOSS PER COMMON SHARE   

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number vested of
common shares, plus the net impact of common shares (computed using the treasury stock method), if dilutive, resulting from the
exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, plus the conversion of preferred stock.  

The
following common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of weighted average dilutive common shares because their
inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:  

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU
2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified
in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 requires
adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case the Company would be required to apply the
amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-15 and its impact on
its condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

REGISTRATION
RIGHTS PENALTY   

In
connection with the sale of the Company s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company granted the purchasers certain
registration rights. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had not yet filed a registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration rights agreements entered into with the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock purchasers
provide that the Company has to pay liquidated damages equal to 1% of all Series C subscription amounts received on the date the
Series C resale registration statement was due to be filed pursuant to such registration rights agreements. The Company is required

2016, the Company made aggregate principal repayments of $125,000 associated with convertible and other notes payable to the same

default with respect to notes payable to a company wholly-owned by the Executive Chairman with an aggregate principal balance

$0 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $17,000 and $43,250 during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively, for business development related to installations of EV charging stations by the Company in accordance
with the support services contract. These amounts are recorded as compensation on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
These amounts were paid pursuant to a Fee/Commission Agreement entered into by the Company and FGI on November 17, 2009.  

FGI and the Company s Chief Operating
Officer ( COO ) have made certain claims for historical unpaid compensation pursuant to their Fee/Commission Agreements
with the Company. During November 2016, the Company s Board of Directors quantified the total claims to be approximately
$475,000 for each party and, upon further analysis, determined the Company s reasonable estimate of the aggregate liability
is $400,000 (estimated as $217,000 payable in cash and $183,000 payable in stock options) which was accrued and is included within
accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

In addition, FGI has made a claim that expired
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,733,335 shares of common stock should be replaced pursuant to an agreement with the Company.
As of the filing date, the fair value of the warrant claim is estimated to be approximately $1,000,000. The Company believes this
claim is without merit. 

A committee of the Board expects to resolve
all claims made by FGI (including the possible replacement warrants) by the end of the fiscal year. Separately, a committee of
the Board expects to resolve all claims made by the COO by the end of the fiscal year.

Approval End Date (as defined in the Note) is February 28, 2017, March 31, 2017, or the third business day after the closing of
the Public Offering (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), and (ii) a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the  Warrant )
to purchase 714,285 shares of the Company s common stock ( Common Stock ) at an exercise price per share equal
to the lesser of (i) 80% of the per share price of the Common Stock in the Company s contemplated Public Offering, (ii)
$0.70 per share, (iii) 80% of the unit price in the Public Offering (if applicable), (iv) the exercise price of any warrants issued
in the Public Offering, or (v) the lowest conversion price, exercise price, or exchange price, of any security issued by the Company
that is outstanding on October 13, 2016. Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the fifth (5th) trading day after
the pricing of the Public Offering, but in no event later than February 28, 2017, or, if the Listing Approval End Date is February
28, 2017, in no event later than March 31, 2017, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser such number of duly and validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable Origination Shares (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) equal to $1,680,000, divided by the lowest
of (i) $0.70 per share, or (ii) the lowest daily closing price of the Common Stock during the ten days prior to delivery of the
Origination Shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits), or (iii) 80% of the Common Stock offering price of the Public Offering,
or (iv) 80% of the unit price offering price of the Public Offering (if applicable), or (v) the exercise price of any warrants
issued in the Public Offering.  

Pursuant
to the Note, the Purchaser is obligated to provide the Company additional $250,000 or $500,000 advances under the Note as certain
milestones, contained in the Funding Schedule within the Note, are achieved (the  Additional Advances ). In the event
of an Additional Advance, the Company shall deliver an additional warrant within three (3) days of such advances in the form of
the Warrant (the  Additional Warrant ), with the following terms: (i) an aggregate exercise amount equal to 100% of
the principal sum attributable to the Additional Advance or Further Advance, respectively (ii) at the per share exercise price
then in effect on the Warrant, and (iii) the number of shares for which the Additional Warrant is exercisable equal to the aggregate
exercise amount for the Additional Warrant divided by the exercise price. The Purchaser may, at its election, exercise the Warrant,
and each Additional Warrant, if any, pursuant to a cashless exercise.  

If
the Company fails to repay the balance due under the Note, or issues a Variable Security (as defined in the Note) up to and including
the date of the closing of the Public Offering, the Purchaser has the right to convert all or any portion of the outstanding Note
into shares of Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Note. All amounts due under the Note become
immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of an event of default as set forth in the Note.  

ITEM
    2.   
         MANAGEMENT S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview   

We
are a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle ( EV ) charging equipment and networked EV charging
services. We offer both residential and commercial EV charging equipment, enabling EV drivers to easily recharge at various location
types.  

Our
principal line of products and services is our Blink EV charging network (the  Blink Network ) and EV charging equipment
(also known as electric vehicle supply equipment) and EV related services. Our Blink Network is proprietary cloud-based software
that operates, maintains, and tracks all of the Blink EV charging stations and the associated charging data. The Blink Network
provides property owners, managers, and parking companies, who we refer to as our Property Partners, with cloud-based services
that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations, payment processing, and provide EV drivers with vital
station information including station location, availability, and applicable fees.  

We
offer our Property Partners a flexible range of business models for EV charging equipment and services. In our comprehensive and
turnkey business model, we own and operate the EV charging equipment, manage the installation, maintenance, and related services,
and share a portion of the EV charging revenue with the property owner. Alternatively, Property Partners may share in the equipment
and installation expenses, with CarCharging operating and managing the EV charging stations and providing connectivity to the
Blink Network. For Property Partners interested in purchasing and owning EV charging stations that they manage, we can also provide
EV charging hardware, site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, and service and maintenance services.  

As
reflected in our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had had a cash balance,
a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit of $9,132, $22,166,473, and $82,527,579, respectively. During nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred net losses of $9,154,924 and $6,776,772, respectively. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, as expressed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Historically,
we have been able to raise funds to support our business operations.  

Through
April 16, 2014, 350 Green was our wholly-owned subsidiary in which we had full control and the Company was consolidated. Beginning
on April 17, 2014, when 350 Green s assets and liabilities were transferred to a trust mortgage, 350 Green became a Variable
Interest Entity ( VIE ). The consolidation guidance relating to accounting for VIEs requires an enterprise to perform
an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
in a variable interest entity and perform ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
We determined that our Company is the primary beneficiary of 350 Green, and as such, 350 Green s assets, liabilities and
results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements.   

Consolidated
Results of Operations   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues   

We
have generated charging service revenue of $380,857 related to installed EV charging stations for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $436,259 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $55,402, or 13%, which was primarily
a result of a reduction in revenue from a program sponsored by Nissan North America that the Company has participated in since
July 2014. As part of the program, drivers that purchase a Nissan Leaf in certain markets within the United States receive two
years of free charging. Since July 2015, other participating companies have added charging stations to the program reducing the
amount of revenue we generate in connection with this program. We expect revenues derived from this program during the balance
of 2016 to continue to be lower than the revenues derived from this program in the same periods in 2015.  

Grant
revenue decreased from $262,858 to $71,125 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $191,733, or 73%. Grants,
rebate and incentives, collectively  grant revenue  relating to equipment and the related installation are deferred
and amortized in a manner consistent with the depreciation expense of the related assets over their useful lives. Our grant revenue
during the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years was primarily derived from our agreement with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(the  BAAQMD ). Our agreement with the BAAQMD ended on December 31, 2015. Our current source of grant revenue is from
the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. The ability to secure grant revenues is typically unpredictable and, therefore, uncertain.
However, historically, the Company has secured and depended on incentives and intends to continue to pursue incentives from various
governmental jurisdictions. As an example, the Company recently endorsed the Obama Administration s announcement of, among
other things, programs to release up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial
EV charging facilities, and launch the Fixing America s Surface Transportation ( FAST ) Act process to identify
and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network of EV fast charging stations.  

Equipment sales decreased
from $232,739 to $205,821 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $26,918, or 12%. The decrease was primarily
due to a lower volume of residential units sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by a higher
volume of commercial units sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other
revenue increased from $74,284 to $97,356 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $23,072, or 31%. Other
revenues are comprised of network and transaction fees earned from our hosts. The increase was primarily due an increase in maintenance
contracts from our hosts during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015.  

Cost
of Revenues   

Cost
of revenues primarily consists of depreciation of installed charging stations, amortization of the Blink Network infrastructure,
the cost of charging station parts and related services sold, repairs and maintenance, electricity reimbursements to hosts and
revenue share payments made to hosts when we are the primary obligor in the revenue share arrangement. Cost of revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 were $700,865 (93% of revenues) as compared to $775,240 (77% of revenues) for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $74,375, or 10%. There is a degree of variability in our gross margins related
to charging services revenues from period to period primarily due to (i) the mix of revenue share payment arrangements, (ii) electricity
reimbursements, and (iii) the estimated repair and maintenance costs associated with those charging stations not currently in
operation. Any variability in our gross margins related to equipment sales depends on the mix of products sold.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses consist of selling, marketing, advertising, payroll, administrative, finance and professional expenses.  

Compensation
expense decreased by $612,355, or 28%, from $2,176,818 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,564,463 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction of approximately $680,000 in non-cash
stock-based compensation expense as compared to the 2015 period (which includes a $218,000 reduction of stock-based compensation
expense related to share-based payments made to our Chief Operating Officer during the three months ended September 30, 2015 under
the terms of his employment agreement) as well as a reduction in payroll and other related expenses of approximately $467,000
due to the departure of certain management and other personnel during the second half of 2015, partially offset by $400,000 of
commission expense in the 2016 period (of which, $217,000 is payable in cash and $183,000 is payable in stock options).  

Other
operating expenses consist primarily of rent, travel and IT expenses. Other operating expenses decreased by $40,723, or 11%, from
$383,497 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $342,774 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease
was primarily attributable to decreased IT expenses and call center expenses as the Company inaugurated its own internal call
center in Phoenix, Arizona during 2016 as compared to the prior period.  

General
and administrative expenses increased by $156,619, or 59%, from $264,334 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $420,953
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased legal and consulting fees as compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from increased general corporate matters and litigation activity.  

Other
(Expense) Income    

Other
income was $737,809 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to other expense of $134,260 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $872,069, or 118%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the loss we recorded from
the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of $255,788 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
a gain of $1,272,938 during the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,528,726, primarily as a result of the
Company s share price, which increased the value of its warrant liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in the provision
for non-compliance penalty for delinquent regular SEC filings of $528,070.  

Net
Loss   

Our
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $552,216, or 30%, to $2,408,156 as compared to $1,855,940
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in other expenses of $872,069,
offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $496,459 and gross profit of $176,606. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $373,810, or 15%, from $2,421,046 to $2,794,856 for the aforementioned
reasons and due to an increase in the dividend attributable to Series C Convertible Preferred shareholders of $144,200 and a decrease
in income attributable to our non-controlling interest of $322,606.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared With Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Revenues   

We
have generated charging service revenue of $1,121,739 related to installed EV charging stations for nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $1,342,029 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $220,290, or 16%, which is primarily
a result of a reduction in revenue from a program sponsored by Nissan North America that the Company has participated in since
July 2014. The Program Coordinator pays the Company based on the number of program participants and the percentage of DC Fast
Chargers in the program. Starting in July 2015, the private company participating in this program began adding chargers to the
program and we no longer were able to generate as much revenue from the percentage of chargers we have in the program. We expect
revenues derived from this program during the balance of 2016 to continue to be lower than the revenues we derived from this program
in the same periods in 2015.  

Grant
revenue decreased from $1,068,837 to $228,290 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $840,547, or 79%.
Grants, rebate and incentives, collectively  grant revenue  relating to equipment and the related installation are
deferred and amortized in a manner consistent with the depreciation expense of the related assets over their useful lives. Our
grant revenue during the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years was primarily derived from our agreement with the BAAQMD. Our agreement with
the BAAQMD ended on December 31, 2015. Our current source of grant revenue is from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. The ability
to secure grant revenues is typically unpredictable and, therefore, uncertain. However, historically, the Company has secured
and depended on incentives and intends to continue to pursue incentives from various governmental jurisdictions. As an example,
the Company recently endorsed the Obama Administration s announcement of, among other things, programs to release up to
$4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial EV charging facilities, and launch
the FAST Act process to identify and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network
of EV fast charging stations.  

Equipment
sales increased from $638,718 to $856,195 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $217,477, or 34%. The
increase was primarily due to a higher volume of residential and commercial units sold during the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

Other
revenue increased from $190,968 to $305,687 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $114,719, or 60%.
Other revenues are comprised of network and transaction fees earned from our hosts. The increase was primarily due to an increase
in maintenance contracts from out host during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  

Cost
of Revenues   

Cost
of revenues primarily consists of depreciation of installed charging stations, amortization of the Blink Network infrastructure,
the cost of charging station parts and related services sold, repairs and maintenance, electricity reimbursements to hosts and
revenue share payments made to hosts when we are the primary obligor in the revenue share arrangement. Cost of revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,305,605 (92% of revenues) as compared to $2,557,402 (79% of revenues) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $251,797, or 10%, primarily due to a reduction in network fees due to a renegotiated
contract. There is a degree of variability in our gross margins related to charging services revenues from period to period primarily
due to (i) the mix of revenue share payment arrangements, (ii) electricity reimbursements, and (iii) the estimated repair and
maintenance costs associated with those charging stations not currently in operation. Any variability in our gross margins related
to equipment sales depends on the mix of products sold.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses consist of selling, marketing, advertising, payroll, administrative, finance and professional expenses.  

Compensation
expense decreased by $2,815,132, or 40%, from $7,032,382 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $4,217,250 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to share-based payments with a fair value of approximately
$1,375,000 made to our Chief Operating Officer during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 under the terms of an employment
agreement, as well as reduced payroll expenses of approximately $1,172,000 due to the departure of certain management and other
personnel during the second half of 2015.  

Other
operating expenses consist primarily of rent, travel and IT expenses. Other operating expenses decreased by $148,501, or 12%,
from $1,205,648 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,057,147 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease
was primarily attributable to decreased call center expenses as the Company inaugurated their own internal call center in Phoenix,
Arizona during 2016 and reduced travel expenses as compared to the prior period.  

General
and administrative expenses decreased by $731,156, or 41%, from $1,789,826 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,058,670
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reduced legal and consulting fees as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily attributable to cash constraints during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Other
(Expense) Income    

Other
income was $2,567,934 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to other expense of $3,028,163 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $5,596,097, or 218%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a loss from the change
in the fair value of warrant liabilities of $2,450,045 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a gain
of $2,161,845 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $4,611,890, primarily as a result of the increase
in the Company s share price, which increased the value of its warrant liabilities. In addition, there was $1,833,896 of
income during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which related to a notification from the DOE that it had no further property
interest in certain direct current fast chargers, which resulted in the release of our liability to the DOE.  

Net
Loss   

Our
net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2,378,152, or 35%, to $9,154,924 as compared to $6,776,772
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in other expense of $5,596,097,
partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of $3,694,789 and gross profit of $476,844. Our net loss attributable to
common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2,402,052, or 31%, from $7,823,272 to $10,225,324
for the aforementioned reasons and due to an increase in the dividend attributable to Series C Convertible Preferred shareholders
of $413,500 and a decrease in income attributable to our non-controlling interest of $389,600.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we primarily financed our activities from proceeds derived from debt and equity financings.
A significant portion of the funds raised from the sale of capital stock have been used to cover working capital needs and personnel,
office expenses and various consulting and professional fees.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we used cash of $1,913,463 and $4,975,523 in operating activities, respectively.
Our cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to our net loss
of $9,154,924, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $5,383,069, partially offset by $1,858,392 of net cash
provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Our cash used in operating activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $6,776,772, adjusted for net non-cash expenses in the aggregate
amount of $1,512,106, partially offset by $289,143 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities was $80,463 which was used to purchase charging stations
and other fixed assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was $171,233, of which
$38,368 was used for the purchase of office and computer equipment and $210,965 was paid to the ECOtality Estate Creditor s
Committee, offset by $78,100 of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.  

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,813,827, of which, $1,314,620 of net proceeds
(gross proceeds of $1,367,120 less issuance costs of $52,500) were from the sale of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants,
$600,000 was provided in connection with proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes to a related party and $139,844 was provided
by bank overdrafts, partially offset by the repayment of $135,428 of notes payable and the payment of an aggregate of $157,709
of issuance costs. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,640,063, of which
$3,830,000 was due to the release of funds from escrow in connection with a prior sale of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock,
partially offset by the repayment of notes payable of $189,937.  

We
expect that through the next 12 months from the date of this filing, we will require external funding to sustain operations and
to follow through on the execution of our business plan. There can be no assurance that our plans will materialize and/or that
we will be successful in our efforts to obtain the funding to cover working capital shortfalls. Given these conditions, there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our future is contingent upon our ability to secure
the levels of debt or equity capital we need to meet our cash requirements. In addition, our ability to continue as a going concern
must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrants into established markets,
the competitive environment in which we operate and the current capital raising environment.  

Since
inception, our operations have primarily been funded through proceeds from equity and debt financings. Although management believes
that we have access to capital resources, there are currently no commitments in place for new financing at this time, except as
described above under the heading Recent Developments, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all.  

We
intend to raise additional funds during the next twelve months. The additional capital raised would be used to fund our operations.
The current level of cash and operating margins is insufficient to cover our existing fixed and variable obligations, so increased
revenue performance and the addition of capital through issuances of securities are critical to our success. Should we not be
able to raise additional debt or equity capital through a private placement or some other financing source, we would take one
or more of the following actions to conserve cash: further reductions in employee headcount, reduction in base salaries to senior
executives and employees, and other cost reduction measures. Assuming that we are successful in our growth plans and development
efforts, we believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity capital. There is no guarantee that we will be able
to raise such additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all.  

Through
September 30, 2016, we incurred an accumulated deficit since inception of $82,527,579.    As
of September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance and working capital deficit of $9,132   and
$22,166,473, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred net losses of $2,408,156 and
$9,154,924, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   

These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts

On
March 11, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a purchaser for gross proceeds of an aggregate of $2,900,040,
of which, $650,040 was paid to us at closing and the remaining $2,250,000 is payable to us upon the completion of certain milestones,
as specified in the agreement. At closing, 10,834 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock were issued to the purchaser
and 2,500 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock were issued upon the completion of certain milestone during the three
months ended March 31, 2016.  

We
entered into the Purchase Agreement dated October 7, 2016 with JMJ. In accordance with its terms, the Purchase Agreement became
effective upon (i) execution by the Parties of the Purchase Agreement, a note, and a warrant, and (ii) delivery of an initial
advance pursuant to the note of $500,000, which occurred on October 13, 2016. The note and warrant were issued on October 13,
2016. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, JMJ purchased from our Company (i) a Promissory Note in the aggregate principal amount
of up to $3,725,000 due and payable on the earlier of February 15, 2017 or if the Listing Approval End Date (as defined in the
note) is February 28, 2017, March 31, 2017, or the third business day after the closing of the Public Offering (as defined in
the Purchase Agreement), and (ii) a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to purchase 714,285 shares of our common stock at an exercise
price per share equal to the lesser of (i) 80% of the per share price in the contemplated Public Offering, (ii) $0.70 per share,
(iii) 80% of the unit price in the Public Offering (if applicable), (iv) the exercise price of any warrants issued in the Public
Offering, or (v) the lowest conversion price, exercise price, or exchange price, of any security issued by us that is outstanding
on October 13, 2016. The aggregate exercise price is $500,000. Pursuant to the terms of the note, JMJ has agreed that it will
not convert the note into more than 9.99% of our outstanding shares. JMJ currently does not own any shares of our common stock.  

On
the fifth (5th) trading day after the pricing of the Public Offering, but in no event later than February 28, 2017, or, if the
Listing Approval End Date is February 28, 2017, in no event later than March 31, 2017, we will deliver to JMJ shares of our common
stock ( Origination Shares ) equal to 48% of the consideration paid by JMJ under the note divided by the lowest of
(i) $0.70 per share, or (ii) the lowest daily closing price of the Issuer s common stock during the ten days prior to delivery
of the Origination Shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits), or (iii) 80% of the common stock offering price of the Public
Offering, or (iv) 80% of the unit price offering price of the Public Offering (if applicable), or (v) the exercise price of any
warrants issued in the Public Offering.  

The
initial amount borrowed under the note was $500,000, with the remaining amounts permitted to be borrowed under the note being
subject to us achieving certain milestones. JMJ will receive a Common Stock Purchase Warrant after each advance. In addition,
we agreed that until the closing of the Public Offering, if we issue any security with any term more favorable to the holder of
such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to JMJ in the note or the
warrants, such term, at the JMJ s option, shall become a part of the transaction documents with JMJ. In addition, we agreed
to a one-year prohibition (after the closing of the Public Offering) on issuing securities at an effective price per share lower
than the greatest of: (i) the exercise price of any warrant issued to JMJ; (ii) the offering price in the Public Offering; or
(iii) the exercise price of any warrants issued in the Public Offering. In addition, we agreed on a prohibition on issuing any
debt or variable rate security.

Patent
License Agreement   

On
March 29, 2012, we, as licensee (the  Licensee ) entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with Mr. Farkas,
and Balance Holdings, LLC (an entity controlled by Mr. Farkas) (collectively, the  Licensor ), whereby we agreed to
pay a royalty of 10% of the gross profits received by us from commercial sales and/or use of two provisional patent applications,
one relating to an inductive charging parking bumper and one relating to a process which allows multiple EVs to plug into an EV
charging station simultaneously and charge as the current becomes available.  

On
March 11, 2016, the Licensee and the Licensor entered into an agreement related to the March 29, 2012 patent license agreement.
The parties acknowledged that the Licensee has paid a total of $8,525 in registration and legal fees for the U.S. Provisional
Patent Application No. 61529016 (the  Patent Application ) (related to the inductive charging parking bumper) to date.
Effective March 11, 2016, the patent license agreement, solely with respect to the Patent Application and the parties  rights
and obligations thereto, was terminated. Mr. Farkas agreed to be solely responsible for all future costs and fees associated with
the prosecution of the patent application. In the event the Patent Application is successful, Mr. Farkas shall grant a credit
to the Licensee in the amount of $8,525 to be applied against any outstanding amount(s) owed to him. If the Licensee does not
have any outstanding payment obligations to Mr. Farkas at the time the Patent Application is approved, Mr. Farkas shall remit
the $8,525 to the Licensee within twenty (20) days of the approval. The parties agreed to a mutual release of any claims associated
with the patent license agreement. We have not paid nor incurred any royalties to date under the patent license agreement.

Recent
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU
2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified
in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-15 requires
adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments
prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are currently evaluating ASU 2016-15 and its impact on our condensed consolidated
financial statements or disclosures.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption
until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.  

ITEM
    3.   
         QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

We
are not required to provide the information required by this Item because we are a smaller reporting company.  

ITEM
    4.   
         CONTROLS
    AND PROCEURES    

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls   

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), means controls
and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Based
on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.  

1.  
      We
    do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
    over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year
    ended December 31, 2015. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls
    and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that
    resulted represented a material weakness.   

2.  
      We
    do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company s ability to gather, analyze
    and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature,
    segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
    possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
    individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure
    controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.   

3.  
      We
    do not have personnel with sufficient experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address complex
    transactions.   

4.  
      We
    have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on
    a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact
    of the lack of timely communication between non financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our
    reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.   

5.  
      We
    have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting by
    our Board of Directors is ineffective. The Board of Directors has not provided adequate review of the Company s SEC s
    filings and condensed consolidated financial statements and has not provided adequate supervision and review of the Company s
    accounting personnel or oversight of the independent registered accounting firm s audit of the Company s condensed
    consolidated financial statement.   

To
help address these material weaknesses, management engaged financial consultants and performed additional analyses and other procedures.  

Notwithstanding
the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there are material weaknesses as identified herein, we believe that our
condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report fairly present our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods covered thereby in all material respects.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule
13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.    

General
Litigation    

From
time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company
records legal costs associated with loss contingencies as incurred and has accrued for all probable and estimable settlements.  

On
July 28, 2015, a Notice of Arbitration was received stating ITT Cannon has a dispute with Blink for the manufacturing and purchase
of 6,500 charging cables by Blink, who has not taken delivery or made payment on the contract price of $737,425. ITT Cannon also
seeks to be paid the cost of attorney s fees as well as punitive damages. The parties have agreed on a single arbitrator
and are working to schedule the arbitration. The Company contends that the product was not in accordance with the specifications
in the purchase order and, as such, believes the claim is without merit. The parties have agreed on a single arbitrator. The arbitration
hearing is currently scheduled for February 6, 2017 through February 8, 2017. Depositions have begun while simultaneously pursuing
settlement options.  

On
May 18, 2016, the Company was served with a complaint from Solomon Edwards Group, LLC for breach of written agreement and unjust
enrichment for failure to pay invoices in the amount of $172,645 for services provided, plus interest and costs. The invoices
have been accrued for in the periods in which the services were provided. The Company has responded to the claim and is simultaneously
pursuing settlement options.  

On
September 9, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit of Chicago, Illinois affirmed the ruling of the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in the matter of JNS Power   Control Systems, Inc. v. 350
Green, LLC in favor of JNS, which affirmed the sale of certain assets by 350 Green to JNS and the assumption of certain 350 Green
liabilities by JNS. On April 7, 2016, JNS amended the complaint to add CCGI alleging an unspecified amount of lost revenues from
the chargers, among other matters, caused by the defendants. Plaintiff also seeks indemnity for its unspecified costs in connection
with enforcing the Asset Purchase Agreement in courts in New York and Chicago. CCGI has filed a motion to dismiss and the parties
continue a series of settlement discussions with a named Magistrate Judge ahead of court proceedings.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.   

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described
below, as well as other information included in this prospectus before deciding to purchase our securities. There are many risks
that affect our business and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. Our business, financial condition or
operating results could be materially harmed by any of these risks. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to
decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think
are immaterial may also affect our business and results of operations.   

Relating
to Our Business   

Our
Revenue Growth Depends on Consumers  Willingness to Adopt Electric Vehicles.    

Our
growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of electric vehicles ( EV ), and we are subject to a risk
of any reduced demand for EVs. If the market for EVs does not gain broad market acceptance or develops more slowly than we expect,
our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is
relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving
government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements, long development cycles for EV original equipment
manufacturers, and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the purchase and use of alternative fuel
vehicles, and specifically EVs, include:  

perceptions
    about EV quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially
    if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of EVs;      

the
    limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge and concerns about running out of power while in use;   

improvements
    in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;   

consumers 
    desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;   

the
    environmental consciousness of consumers;   

volatility
    in the cost of oil and gasoline;   

consumers 
    perceptions of the dependency of the U.S. on oil from unstable or hostile countries and the impact of international conflicts;   

government
    regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;   

access
    to charging stations, standardization of EV charging systems and consumers  perceptions about convenience and cost to
    charge an EV; and   

the
    availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs or future regulation requiring increased
    use of nonpolluting vehicles.   

The
influence of any of the factors described above may negatively impact the widespread consumer adoption of EVs, which would materially
adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.  

We
Need Additional Capital to Fund Our Growing Operations and Cannot Assure You That We Will Be Able to Obtain Sufficient Capital
on Reasonable Terms or at All, and We May Be Faced to Limit the Scope of Our Operations.    

We
need additional capital to fund our growing operations and if adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms
or available at all, we may not be able to undertake expansion or continue our marketing efforts and we would have to modify our
business plans accordingly. The extent of our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability;
(ii) the release of competitive products and/or services by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in research and
development; (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions; and (v) our growth. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.  

Even
if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional
capital that are acceptable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the
holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain
financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We cannot give you any assurance that any
additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.  

The
Report of Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Contains an Explanatory Paragraph That Expresses Substantial Doubt
About Our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.    

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and
for the year then ended indicates that our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
The report states that, since we have incurred net losses since inception and we need to raise additional funds to meet our obligations
and sustain our operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans in regard to
these matters are described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years then
ended. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

We
Have a History of Significant Losses, and If We Do Not Achieve and Sustain Profitability, Our Financial Condition Could Suffer.    

We
have experienced significant net losses, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net
losses of $8.2 million and $23.2 million the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and as of December 31, 2015
our accumulated deficit was $73.4 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue
to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders  equity and working capital. If our revenue grows
more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability
and our financial condition could suffer. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability
in subsequent periods. Whether we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted.
Unless such cash flow levels are achieved in addition to the proceeds from this offering, we may need to borrow additional funds
or sell debt or equity securities, or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  

If
the proceeds from this offering are insufficient for us to continue as a going concern, it could make it more difficult for us
to raise additional capital, should it be needed, or cause our customers, suppliers and other business partners to lose confidence
in us thereby resulting in a reduction of revenue, loss of supply resources and other effects that would be significantly harmful
to our business. If adequate funds are not available when needed, our liquidity, financial condition and operating results would
be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to operate our business without significant changes in our operations
or at all.  

We
May Not Have The Liquidity to Support Our Future Operations and Capital Requirements.    

Whether
we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted. Unless such cash flow levels
are achieved, in addition to the proceeds from this offering, we may need to borrow additional funds or sell debt or equity securities,
or some combination thereof, to provide funding for our operations. Such additional funding may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed, our financial condition and operating results would
be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to operate our business without significant changes in our operations,
or at all.  

We
Are Applying For Listing of Our Common Stock And Warrants on NASDAQ. We Can Provide No Assurance That Our Common Stock And Warrants
Qualify to Be Listed, And if Listed, That Our Securities Will Continue to Meet The NASDAQ Listing Requirements. If We Fail to
Comply With The Continuing Listing Standards of NASDAQ, Our Securities Could Be Delisted.    

We
expect that our securities will be eligible to be listed on NASDAQ subject to our ability to satisfy the initial listing requirements.
Our ability to have our securities become listed on NASDAQ will require us to, among other items, improve our balance sheet, which
we may be unable to accomplish. As of June 30, 2016, we had accumulated stockholders  deficiency of approximately $19 million,
and our stockholders  deficiency may increase as a result of additional net losses in subsequent quarterly periods.  

We
can provide no assurance that our listing application will be approved, and that an active trading market for our common stock
will develop and continue. If, after listing, we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, such as the corporate
governance requirements, stockholder equity requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to
delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair
your ability to sell or purchase common stock underlying the units when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can
provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock
to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from
dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ s listing requirements.  

To
meet the requirements of NASDAQ, we may be required to restructure certain of our equity securities or satisfy certain liabilities
through the issuance of additional equity securities. Our ability to restructure certain of our equity securities may require
us to enter into new agreements with the applicable security holders, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms or at all.
Any such agreement may result in the issuance of new securities or the modification of the rights of existing securities in a
manner that may be dilutive to our common stock holders. In addition, NASDAQ has certain requirements that are beyond our control,
such as financial requirements that are based on the trading price of our stock. If we are unable to meet the minimum financial
eligibility of NASDAQ, we may be unable to list our stock, and we may be unsuccessful in completing this offering. Moreover, it
would prevent us from increasing liquidity in our shares of common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on
favorable terms, or at all.  

The
Unavailability, Reduction or Elimination of Government Incentives Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial
Condition, Operating Results and Prospects.    

As
of December 31, 2015, government grants accounted for 29.5% of our revenues. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application
of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in diminished
revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. This could materially and adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results.  

Our
growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies for EV charging equipment. In the event such subsidies
discontinue, our business outlook and financial conditions could be negatively impacted.  

If
We Are Unable to Keep Up With Advances in EV Technology, We May Suffer a Decline in Our Competitive Position.    

The
EV industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we are unable to keep up with changes in EV technology, our competitive
position may deteriorate which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial
condition. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our EV charging stations and Blink Network software in order to
continue to provide EV charging services with the latest technology. However, due to our limited cash resources, our efforts to
do so may be limited. For example, the EV charging network that we acquired from ECOtality was originally funded, in part, by
the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ), which funding is no longer available to us. As a result, we may be unable to
grow, maintain and enhance the network of charging stations that we acquired from ECOtality at the same rate and scale as ECOtality
did prior to the acquisition or at levels comparable our current competitors. Any failure of our charging stations to compete
effectively with other manufacturers  charging stations will harm our business, operating results and prospects.  

We
Need to Manage Growth in Operations to Realize Our Growth Potential and Achieve Our Expected Revenues, and Our Failure to Manage
Growth Will Cause a Disruption of Our Operations Resulting in the Failure to Generate Revenue and an Impairment of Our Long-Lived
Assets.    

In
order to take advantage of the growth that we anticipate in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand
our marketing operations. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and
information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management
information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth
could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.  

In
order to achieve the above-mentioned targets, the general strategies of our Company are to maintain and search for hard-working
employees who have innovative initiatives, as well as to keep a close eye on expansion opportunities through merger and/or acquisition.  

If
Our Estimates or Judgments Relating to Our Critical Accounting Policies Prove to Be Incorrect, Our Financial Condition And Results
of Operations Could Be Adversely Affected.    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed under  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  included elsewhere in this prospectus and in
our consolidated financial statements included herein. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related
to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived
assets, pension and other post-retirement benefits, product warranty, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, valuation
of common stock warrants, and share-based compensation. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected
if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations
to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.  

We
Face Risks Arising From Acquisitions.    

In
2012 and 2013, we acquired certain assets from 350 Green and Beam Charging. We may pursue similar strategic transactions in the
future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and
control environment, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing
clients of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the
failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses,
and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating
an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions and other strategic transactions. These
risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions and could result in the failure to realize the full
economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an
acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period
of time. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of 50% of the interests of the ECOtality Estate in April 2015, we issued
certain shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which we believe constitute an exempt issuance as intended under agreements with certain
of our investors as such shares (i) were issued to effectuate the strategic acquisition of ECOtality, and (ii) permit us, in our
sole control, to settle these shares for cash at stated optional redemption dates, as opposed to a variable number of shares.
However, there can be no assurance that our investors agree with our interpretation of our investment documents and won t
pursue any of the potential remedies that may be available to them.  

We
Have Limited Insurance Coverage, and Any Claims Beyond Our Insurance Coverage May Result in Our Incurring Substantial Costs and
a Diversion of Resources.    

We
hold employer s liability insurance generally covering death or work-related injury of employees. We hold public liability
insurance covering certain incidents involving third parties that occur on or in the premises of our Company. We hold directors
and officers liability insurance. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our senior management or key personnel,
or business interruption insurance. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any claim for product liability, damage
to our fixed assets or employee injuries. Any liability or damage to, or caused by, our facilities or our personnel beyond our
insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.  

Our
Future Success Depends, in Part, on the Performance and Continued Service of Our Officers.    

We
presently depend to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of our management team, which consists
of Michael Calise (our CEO), Michael D. Farkas (our Executive Chairman), Andy Kinard (our President) and Ira Feintuch (our Chief
Operating Officer). The loss of services of Mr. Calise, Mr. Farkas, Mr. Kinard or Mr. Feintuch could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Failure to maintain our management team could prove disruptive to
our daily operations, require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
Future Success Depends, in Part, on Our Ability to Attract and Retain Highly Qualified Personnel.    

Our
future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We are in the process of building
our management team. Among other positions, we need to hire a Chief Financial Officer with public company experience. Mr. Calise
currently acts as our interim Chief Financial Officer. Although we intend to hire a Chief Financial Officer soon, there is no
assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources to do so. Our accounting controls may continue to be deficient unless
we obtain the services of an experienced Chief Financial Officer who can help us address material weaknesses. In addition, expansion
of our business and the management and operation of our Company will require additional managers and employees with industry experience,
and our success will be highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. As our industry continues to evolve,
competition for skilled personnel with the requisite experience will be significant. This competition may make it more difficult
and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees.  

We
Are in an Intensely Competitive Industry and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Be Able to Compete with Our Competitors Who
May Have Greater Resources.    

We
face strong competition from competitors in the EV charging services industry, including competitors who could duplicate our model.
Many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources and other capabilities
than us. In addition, there are very few barriers to entry into the market for our services. There can be no assurance, therefore,
that any of our current and future competitors, many of whom may have far greater resources, will not independently develop services
that are substantially equivalent or superior to our services. Therefore, an investment in our Company is very risky and speculative
due to the competitive environment in which we may operate.  

Our
competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such
as technical qualifications, past contract performance, geographic presence and price. Furthermore, many of our competitors may
be able to utilize substantially greater resources and economies of scale to develop competing products and technologies, divert
sales away from us by winning broader contracts or hire away our employees by offering more lucrative compensation packages. In
the event that the market for EV charging stations expands, we expect that competition will intensify as additional competitors
enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines. In order to secure contracts successfully when competing
with larger, well-financed companies, we may be forced to agree to contractual terms that provide for lower aggregate payments
to us over the life of the contract, which could adversely affect our margins. Our failure to compete effectively with respect
to any of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or operating
results.  

We
Have Experienced Significant Customer Concentration in Recent Periods, And Our Revenue Levels Could Be Adversely Affected if Any
Significant Customer Fails To Purchase Products From Us At Anticipated Levels.    

We
are subject to customer concentration risk as a result of our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a significant
portion of our revenues. The relative magnitude and the mix of revenue from our largest customers have varied significantly quarter
to quarter. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, certain customers have accounted for significant revenues, varying
by period, to our Company. The loss of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

We
May Have Certain Liabilities Associated with the Assets of 350 Green.    

The
status of the assets of 350 Green, a former wholly-owned subsidiary, are uncertain and not within our control. We transferred
the assets of 350 Green to a trust mortgage and 350 Green became a Variable Interest Entity (a  VIE ). We are in the
process of periodically reevaluating the nature of our interests in 350 Green, including whether or not we have achieved full
isolation of the assets and membership interests of 350 Green, ensuring that we could not be required to provide direct or indirect
financial support to our former subsidiary or its creditors. If we are required to provide financial support to our former subsidiary
or its creditors, it would adversely impact our working capital.  

If
a Third Party Asserts That We Are Infringing Its Intellectual Property, Whether Successful or Not, It Could Subject Us to Costly
and Time-Consuming Litigation or Expensive Licenses, and Our Business May Be Harmed.    

The
EV and EV charging industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade
secrets. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Our technologies
may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have acquired from
other companies proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented. Intellectual property infringement claims against us could harm our relationships with our customers,
may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation with respect to these claims. Even
if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could
make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.
Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.  

Any
intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate
or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our
services to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute services that do not infringe.  

With
respect to any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology
found to be in violation of a third party s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available
on reasonable terms, may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one
or more respects. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop
alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.  

The
Success of Our Business Depends in Large Part on Our Ability to Protect and Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights.    

We
rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures
and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We
cannot assure you that any patents will issue with respect to our currently pending patent applications, in a manner that gives
us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.
Our currently issued patents and any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications
may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also,
we cannot assure you that any future service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications
or that any registered service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.  

We
endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business in order
to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies
that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends
on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when
our rights have been infringed.  

Furthermore,
effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which
our services are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope
of protection of intellectual property rights in EV-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.  

Changes
to Federal, State or International Laws or Regulations Applicable To Our Company Could Adversely Affect Our Business.    

Our
business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect government
incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy, electric vehicles and others. These laws and regulations,
and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory
application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may
result in diminished revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. In addition, new laws or regulations
affecting our business could be enacted. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant
portion of management s attention. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to
significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.  

There
are many federal, state and international laws that may affect our business, including measures to regulate charging systems,
electric vehicles, and others. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to significant
liabilities which could adversely affect our business.  

There
are a number of significant matters under review and discussion with respect to government regulations which may affect the business
we intend to enter and/or harm our customers, and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
Ability to Use Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards May Be Limited.    

For
the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
of approximately $53.3 million. We generally are able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. These NOLs
may be offset against future taxable income through 2034, if not utilized before that time. However, our ability to utilize the
NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( Section 382 ). Section
382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an  ownership change.  An ownership change occurs if, among other things,
the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own, have owned or are treated as owning, directly or indirectly, five
percent or more of our common stock increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points
over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders over a three-year rolling period. In the event of an ownership
change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that we may offset with NOLs. Any unused annual
limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs.  

The
rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Because of our numerous capital raises, uncertainty exists
as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past or will undergo one as a result of the various transactions
discussed herein or other future transactions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available or
utilizable.  

Risks
Associated with Our Common Stock   

If
We Fail to Establish and Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control, We May Not Be Able to Report Our Financial Results
Accurately or Prevent Fraud. Any Inability to Report and File Our Financial Results Accurately and Timely Could Harm Our Reputation
and Adversely Impact the Trading Price of Our Common Stock.    

Effective
internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment
existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control
deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have also experienced
complications reporting as a result of material weaknesses and have at times been delinquent in our reporting obligations. We
have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the most recent period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due
to the material weaknesses described below.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board ( PCAOB ) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of
December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 our internal controls over financial reporting ( ICFR ) were not effective at
the reasonable assurance level:  

1.  
      We
    do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
    over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year
    ended December 31, 2015 and that will end on December 31, 2016. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written
    documentation of our internal controls and procedures during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and
    concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.   

2.  
      We
    do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts our ability to gather, analyze and properly review
    information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all
    conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation
    of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management
    evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties during our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures
    and concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.   

3.  
      We
    do not have personnel with sufficient experience with U.S. GAAP to address complex transactions.   

4.  
      We
    have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on
    a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact
    of the lack of timely communication between non financial and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting
    controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.   

5.  
      We
    have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting by
    our audit committee is ineffective. The audit committee has not provided adequate review of our SEC filings and consolidated
    financial statements and has not provided adequate supervision and review of our accounting personnel or oversight of the
    independent registered accounting firm s audit of our consolidated financial statements.   

We
have taken steps to remediate some of the weaknesses described above, including by engaging third party financial consultants
with expertise in accounting for complex transactions and SEC reporting. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as
resources permit.  

Our
Common Stock Is Currently Quoted Only on the OTC Pink Current Information Marketplace ( OTC Pink ), Which May Have
an Unfavorable Impact on Our Stock Price and Liquidity.    

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink. The OTC Pink is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or
NASDAQ. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Pink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders
to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact
on our ability to raise capital in the future.  

There
can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity
will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness
of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able
to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result, holders of our
securities may not find purchasers for our securities should they to desire to sell them. Consequently, our securities should
be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite
period of time.  

Shares
of Our Common Stock Which May Be Issued Upon Conversion of Indebtedness by JMJ May Dilute The Ownership Interests of Our Stockholders.    

On
October 7, 2016, we executed a convertible promissory note in favor of JMJ in the amount up to $3,725,000 bearing interest on
the unpaid balance at the rate of six percent. The initial amount borrowed under the note was $500,000, with the remaining amounts
permitted to be borrowed under the note being subject to us achieving certain milestones. The notes are convertible into shares
of our common stock based on the lesser of a per share price of $0.70 or 60% of the lowest trade prices in the 25 trading days
prior to the date of conversion. If JMJ elects to convert the principal balance of its convertible note into shares of our common
stock under the terms of the note, our current stockholders would be subject to dilution of their interests. Pursuant to the terms
of the note, JMJ has agreed that it will not convert the note into more than 9.99% of our outstanding shares. JMJ currently does
not own any shares of our common stock.  

We
have also issued a warrant to JMJ to purchase 714,285 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the lesser of:
(i) 80% of the per share price of the common stock in our contemplated public offering, (ii) $0.70 per share, (iii) 80% of the
unit price in a public offering (if applicable), (iv) the exercise price of any warrants issued in such public offering, or (v)
the lowest conversion price, exercise price, or exchange price, of any security issued by us that is outstanding on October 13,
2016. The aggregate exercise price is $500,000.  

The
conversion of the foregoing notes and warrant issued to JMJ, in addition to any other outstanding options, warrants, convertible
notes, as well as potential future transactions, would result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective holders
of our common stock.  

Our
Shares of Common Stock Are Very Thinly Traded, and the Price May Not Reflect Our Value and There Can Be No Assurance That There
Will Be an Active Market for Our Shares of Common Stock Either Now or in the Future.    

Our
shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance
that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent
on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to increase awareness of our Company
with investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be
able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market
should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage
firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction
in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling
costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock
as collateral for loans.  

We
Have a Significant Number of Shares of Our Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion of Certain Outstanding Debt Obligations and Convertible
Preferred Stock, and The Issuance of Such Shares Upon Conversion Will Have a Dilutive Impact On Our Stockholders.    

As
of November 1, 2016, there were 21,772,429 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock.
In addition, as of November 1, 2016, we had outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase a total of 70,322,366 shares of
our common stock (57,844,056 warrants and 12,478,310 options). We also had outstanding convertible debt convertible into 805,059
shares of our common stock. Concurrently with the consummation of this offering, certain amounts of the issued and outstanding
shares of our preferred stock may be converted into an amount equal to up to 106,706,791 shares of our common stock as of November
1, 2016. The issuance of such shares will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. For a more complete description concerning
the dilution you will incur if you purchase common stock in this offering, see  Dilution. .  

Future
Issuance of Our Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants Could Dilute the Interests of Existing Stockholders.    

We
may issue additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock, options and warrants in the future. The issuance of a substantial
amount of common stock, options and warrants could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders.
In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock or preferred stock in the public market, or the exercise of a substantial
number of warrants and options either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition
which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could
have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  

We
Have Established Preferred Stock Which Can Be Designated By The Board and Have Established Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, Which Give The Holders Thereof a Liquidation Preference and The Ability to Convert
Such Shares Into Our Common Stock.    

We
have 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, which includes 20,000,000 shares of designated Series A Preferred Stock
of which 11,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding, 10,000 designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock, of which 8,250 shares
are issued and outstanding and 250,000 designated shares of Series C Preferred Stock, of which 150,426 shares are issued and outstanding.
The Series A Preferred Stock does not have a liquidation preference so long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding.
The Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference
of $100 per share, which is pari passu to the liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock and payable prior to the
liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate or sell our assets, the
holders of our Series A Preferred Stock would not have the right to receive any proceeds from any such transaction, holders of
our Series B Preferred Stock would have the right to receive up to approximately $825,000 from any such transaction, and the holders
of our Series C Preferred Stock would have the right to receive up to $15,240,700 from any such transaction, but before any amount
is paid to the holders of our common stock. The payment of the liquidation preferences could result in common stockholders not
receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily.  

Additionally,
the existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of
common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control. Furthermore, the conversion of Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock into common stock may cause substantial dilution to our common stockholders.
Because our Board is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of our stockholders,
subject to NASDAQ rules and regulations, our stockholders will have no control over what designations and preferences our future
preferred stock, if any, will have. In addition, we may be required to redeem any non-converted shares of Series C Preferred Stock
at the rate of $100 per share, plus accrued dividends; and (b) Series B Preferred Stock at the rate of $100 per share, which funds
we may not have, or which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.  

We
Have Outstanding Shares of Preferred Stock With Rights And Preferences Superior to Those of Our Common Stock.    

The
issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock grant the holders
of our preferred stock certain anti-dilution, voting, dividend and liquidation rights that are superior to those held by the holders
of our common stock. In March 2016, we issued Series C Preferred Stock, which grants the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock
anti-dilution, voting, dividend, redemption, liquidation and other contractual rights that are superior to those held by the holders
of our common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are contained in the
Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, filed with the Secretary of State
of Nevada on December 23, 2014 (the  Series C Certificate of Designation ).  

The
issuance of shares of common stock in the future, issuances or deemed issuances of additional shares of common stock for a price
below the applicable preferred stock conversion price will have the effect of diluting current stockholders. The rights of our
preferred stockholders may increase our net losses, dilute our common stockholders, and allow such preferred stockholders to have
approval rights and therefore to exert influence over certain corporate actions. For example, the holders of our Series C Preferred
Stock are entitled to certain dividend, liquidation preference, and anti-dilution rights that are described in the Series C Certificate
of Designation and the related securities purchase agreement dated as of March 11, 2016, as filed with the SEC. In addition, the
holders of our Series C Preferred Stock have certain redemption rights that may be exercised after December 2016 and, if such
rights are exercised, could adversely affect our business and could require us to consider a range of strategic alternatives,
including refinancing their securities or effecting a sale of our Company or its assets. We cannot assure you that the rights
associated with the Series C Preferred Stock or our other series of preferred stock will not adversely affect the holders of our
common stock.  

We
Are Required To Register Under the Securities Act the Resale of Shares of Our Common Stock by a Number of Our Security Holders.
Our Failure to Comply With Our Contractual Obligations and Timely Register the Resale of Any Shares of Our Common Stock Has Resulted
in, and Will Result in, Among Other Things, the Payment of Liquidated Damages, And Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our
Ability to Raise Additional Funds Through Private Placements in The Future And Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business.    

We
have entered into various agreements with purchasers of our securities from time to time which require us to register under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) the resale of shares of our common stock that we have issued
or will be required to issue to such purchasers. We have failed to perform our obligations under these agreements and have accrued
registration rights penalties in an aggregate amount equal to $1,072,937, inclusive of accrued interest. The payment of these
penalties will adversely impact our working capital.  

Our
failure to comply with our contractual obligations and timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock for any reason,
including as a result of any unexpected delay in the completion of any offering, may result in additional breaches of the agreements
with certain security holders and in the payment of liquidated damages as required under the terms of our agreements with certain
security holders. Any additional issuances of securities to these purchasers will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders,
including purchasers in this offering. In addition, our failure to timely register the resale of any shares of our common stock
may result in reputational harm for our Company and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds
through private placements in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.  

We
Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, and You Must Rely on Increases in the Market Prices of Our Common Stock
for Returns on Your Investment.    

For
the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common
stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not
purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors
(the  Board ) and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions
imposed by applicable law and other factors the Board deems relevant.  

Our
Executive Officers and Directors Possess Controlling Voting Power With Respect to Our Common Stock, Which Will Limit Your Influence
on Corporate Matters.    

Our
directors and executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately 37% of our voting stock as of November 1, 2016. As
a result, our insiders have the ability to effectively control our management and affairs through the election and removal of
our Board and all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including any future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially
all of our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change-of-control
transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical
effect of your influence over our business and affairs, through any stockholder vote or otherwise. Any of these effects could
depress the price of our common stock.  

Our
Executive Chairman Mr. Farkas and His Affiliates Collectively Own Approximately 32% of Our Common Stock And May Be Able To Influence
The Outcome of Stockholder Votes. Mr. Farkas  Interests May Differ From Other Stockholders.    

As
of November 1, 2016, our Executive Chairman and director Mr. Farkas and his affiliates beneficially own 43,311,945 shares of our
common stock representing approximately 32% of our outstanding shares of common stock on an as-converted basis. See  Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management  for more information on the beneficial ownership of our common stock.
Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Nevada law, Mr. Farkas may be able to exercise significant
influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions, and will have some control over our management and policies. Mr. Farkas may have interests that are different from
yours. For example, Mr. Farkas may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could
delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control
of our Company, which in turn could reduce the price of our stock. In addition, Mr. Farkas could use his voting influence to maintain
our existing management and directors in office, delay or prevent changes in control of our Company, or support or reject other
management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals
of significant financing transactions.  

In
addition, we have a significant amount of indebtedness in the form of various agreements in favor of an entity affiliated with
Mr. Farkas, The Farkas Group, Inc., including certain convertible notes which have matured and are past due. We have not satisfied
this debt and are in negotiations with Mr. Farkas to extend the maturity dates of such notes. If we are unable to do so on favorable
terms, or at all, Mr. Farkas could seek to enforce the notes against us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
reduce the market price of our common stock.  

Our
Articles of Incorporation Grants Our Board The Power to Issue Additional Shares of Common And Preferred Stock And to Designate
Other Classes of Preferred Stock, All Without Stockholder Approval.    

Our
authorized capital consists of 540,000,000 shares of capital stock of which 40,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.
Our Board, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares of preferred stock in such series as it deems
appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights,
provided it is consistent with Nevada law.  

The
rights of holders of our preferred stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. The
designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant
to shares of our common stock. Furthermore, any issuances of additional stock (common or preferred) will dilute the percentage
of ownership interest of then-current holders of our capital stock and may dilute our book value per share.  

Certain
Provisions of Our Corporate Governing Documents And Nevada Law Could Discourage, Delay, or Prevent A Merger or Acquisition at
a Premium Price.    

Certain
provisions of our organizational documents and Nevada law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a
change in control of our Company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common
stock. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws permit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders,
up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares
constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences
and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions
of the shares of the series.

On
August 1, 2016, we issued a sixty-day convertible note in the principal amount of $30,000 to a company wholly-owned by Mr. Farkas.
Interest on the note accrues at a rate of 18% annually and is payable at maturity. The unpaid principal and accrued interest are

share.  

On
August 15, 2016, we issued a sixty-day convertible note in the principal amount of $100,000 to a company wholly-owned by Mr. Farkas.
Interest on the note accrues at a rate of 18% annually and is payable at maturity. The unpaid principal and accrued interest are
convertible at the election of the holder into shares of common stock at $0.70 per share. In connection with the note issuance,
we issued a five-year immediately vested warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per
share.  

On
September 1, 2016, we issued a sixty-day convertible note in the principal amount of $15,000 to a company wholly-owned by Mr.
Farkas. Interest on the note accrues at a rate of 18% annually and is payable at maturity. The unpaid principal and accrued interest
are convertible at the election of the holder into shares of common stock at $0.70 per share. In connection with the note issuance,
we issued a five-year immediately vested warrant to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share.  

On
September 9, 2016, we issued a sixty-day convertible note in the principal amount of $35,000 to a company wholly-owned by Mr.
Farkas. Interest on the note accrues at a rate of 18% annually and is payable at maturity. The unpaid principal and accrued interest
are convertible at the election of the holder into shares of common stock at $0.70 per share. In connection with the note issuance,

we issued a five-year immediately vested warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per
share.  

The
above securities were issued in reliance on the exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. These securities qualified
for exemption under Section 4(2) since the issuance by us did not involve a public offering. The offerings were not  public
offerings  as defined in 4(a)(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the transactions, manner of the
issuance and number of securities issued. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of securities to a high
number of investors. In addition, the investors had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(a)(2) since they
agreed to and received securities bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Act.
This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part
of a  public offering.  Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption
under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for these transactions.  

ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.   

As of November 14, 2016,
convertible notes with a principal value of $295,000 held by a company wholly-owned by Mr. Farkas discussed under Item 2 have
matured and are more than 30 days past due (the  Past Due Notes ). We have not satisfied this debt. On November 14,
the Company received notices of default from the company wholly-owned by Mr. Farkas with regard to the Past Due Notes as well
as additional convertible notes with a principal value of $115,000 that are not yet 30 days past due. The Company plans on seeking
to negotiate with the company wholly-owned by Mr. Farkas to extend the maturity dates of all past due notes. If we are unable
to do so on favorable terms, or at all, the company wholly-owned by Mr. Farkas could seek to enforce the notes against us, which
could have an adverse effect on our business and reduce the market price of our common stock.
