FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF BOSTON 
  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary have been included. All such adjustments consist of normal recurring accruals. The presentation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston's audited financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on March 18, 2016 (the 2015 Annual Report). Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, all references in this discussion to  the Bank,  "we," "us," "our," or similar references mean the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. 

Note 2   Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.     On August 26, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on our cash flows has not yet been determined. The adoption of this guidance will have no effect on our financial condition or combined results of operations. 
    
  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.   On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to introduce a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The guidance applies to: (1) loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, and other financial assets measured at amortized cost, (2) loan commitments and certain other off-balance sheet credit exposures, (3) debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and (4) beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020. Early application of the guidance is permitted for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and its effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  . On March 14, 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. Specifically, the updated guidance clarifies what steps are required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. The guidance becomes effective for us for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and its effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  . On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued final guidance clarifying that the novation of a derivative contract (that is, a change in the counterparty) in a hedge accounting relationship does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedge accounting relationship. Hedge accounting relationships could continue as long as all of the other hedge accounting criteria are met, including the expectation that the hedge will be highly effective when the creditworthiness of the new counterparty to the derivative contract is considered. The guidance becomes effective for us for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt the guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Leases.   On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the statement of condition and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. In particular, this guidance requires a lessee of operating or finance leases to recognize on the statement of condition a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. However, for leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Under previous GAAP, a lessee was not required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the statement of condition. The guidance becomes effective for us for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019, and early application is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and its effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.     On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued its guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance outlines a comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. In August of 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for the new revenue recognition guidance until January 1, 2018. In March of 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance related to distinguishing when an entity is acting as a principal versus an agent in contracts with customers. The distinction is relevant to reporting revenue gross (as principal) or net (as agent). In April of 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance for identifying performance obligations and licensing agreements for purposes of revenue recognition. Financial instruments and other contractual rights within the scope of other GAAP guidance are excluded from the scope of this new revenue recognition guidance. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Accounting for Cloud Computing Arrangements.   On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendments provide guidance to customers on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it would be accounted for as a service contract. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2016, using the prospective approach, for all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the statement of condition as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance became effective for us for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016, and was adopted retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a   $6.1 million   reclassification of unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to consolidated obligations on the statement of condition at December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment 
    
  We evaluate our individual available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities for other-than-temporary impairment each quarter. 
    
  Available-for-Sale Securities 
    
  We determined that none of our available-for-sale securities were other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , we held certain available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position. These unrealized losses reflect the impact of normal yield and spread fluctuations attendant with security markets. We consider these unrealized losses temporary because we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis on these available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position and neither intend to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. Additionally, there have been no shortfalls of principal or interest on any available-for-sale security. Regarding available-for-sale securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Debentures issued by a supranational institution that were in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016  , are expected to return contractual principal and interest based on our review and analysis of independent third-party credit reports on the supranational institution, and the supranational institution's triple-A (or equivalent) rating by each of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) that rates it. 

Debentures issued by U.S. government-owned corporations are not obligations of the U.S. government and not guaranteed by the U.S. government. However, these securities are rated at the same level as the U.S. government by the NRSROs. These ratings reflect the U.S. government's implicit support of the government-owned corporation as well as the entity's underlying business and financial risk. 

The probability of default on debt issued by Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) is remote given their status as GSEs and their support from the U.S. government. 

The U.S. government-guaranteed securities that we hold are MBS issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). The strength of Ginnie Mae's guarantees as a direct obligation from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us from losses based on current expectations. 

For MBS issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which we sometimes refer to as agency MBS in this report, the strength of the issuers' guarantees through direct obligation or support from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us from losses based on current expectations. 
       
  Held-to-Maturity Securities 
    
  HFA Securities.   We have reviewed our investments in HFA securities and have determined that unrealized losses reflect the impact of normal market yield and spread fluctuations and illiquidity in the credit markets. We have determined that all unrealized losses are temporary given the creditworthiness of the issuers and the underlying collateral, including an assessment of past payment history (no shortfalls of principal or interest), property vacancy rates, debt service ratios, over-collateralization and other credit enhancement, and third-party bond insurance as applicable. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of our held-to-maturity investments in HFA securities that are in an unrealized loss position were rated below investment grade by an NRSRO. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and illiquidity in this market and not to a significant deterioration in the fundamental credit quality of these obligations, and because we do not intend to sell the investments nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of the amortized cost basis, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Agency MBS.   For agency MBS, we determined that the strength of the issuers' guarantees through direct obligation or support from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us from losses based on current expectations. Additionally, there have been no  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

shortfalls of principal or interest on any such security. As a result, we have determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on such MBS are temporary. We do not believe that the declines in market value of these securities are attributable to credit quality, and because we do not intend to sell the investments, nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of the amortized cost basis, we do not consider any of these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Private-Label Residential MBS and ABS Backed by Home Equity Loans.   To ensure consistency in determination of the other-than-temporary impairment for private-label residential MBS and certain home equity loan investments (including home equity ABS) among all FHLBanks, the FHLBanks use an FHLBank System governance committee (the OTTI Governance Committee) and a formal process to ensure consistency in key other-than-temporary impairment modeling assumptions used for purposes of their cash-flow analyses for the majority of these securities. We use the FHLBanks' uniform framework and approved assumptions for purposes of our other-than-temporary impairment cash-flow analyses of our private-label residential MBS and certain home equity loan investments. For additional information see Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 7   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment in the 2015 Annual Report 
    
  To assess whether the entire amortized cost basis of private-label residential MBS will be recovered, cash-flow analyses for each of our private-label residential MBS were performed. These analyses use two third-party models. 
    
  The first third-party model considers borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying our securities, in conjunction with assumptions about current home prices and future changes in home prices and interest rates, producing monthly projections of prepayments, defaults, loan modifications, and loss severities. A significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing-price changes, based on an assessment of individual housing markets for the relevant states and core-based statistical areas (CBSA), as defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget. The OTTI Governance Committee developed a short-term housing price forecast, with projected changes ranging from a decrease of   1.0 percent   to an increase of   10.0 percent   over the 12- month period beginning July 1, 2016. For the vast majority of markets, the projected short-term housing price changes range from an increase of   3.0 percent   to an increase of   6.0 percent  . Thereafter, we have projected a unique recovery path for each relevant geographic area based on an internally developed framework derived from historical data. 
    
  The month-by-month projections of future loan level performance are derived from the first model to determine projected prepayments, defaults, and loss severities. These projections are then input into a second model that allocates the cash flows and losses among the various classes in the securitization structure in accordance with the cash-flow and loss-allocation rules prescribed by the securitization structure. In a securitization in which the credit enhancement for the senior securities is derived from the presence of subordinate securities, losses are generally allocated first to the subordinate securities until their principal balance is reduced to zero. The projected cash flows are based on a number of assumptions and expectations and the results of these models can vary significantly with changes in assumptions and expectations. The scenario of cash flows determined based on the model approach described above reflects a best estimate scenario and includes a base case current-to-trough housing price forecast and a base case housing price recovery path described in the prior paragraph. 
    
  For those securities for which a credit loss was recognized during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the following table presents a summary of the average projected values over the remaining lives of the securities for the significant inputs used to measure the amount of the credit loss recognized in earnings, as well as related current credit enhancement. Credit enhancement is defined as the percentage of subordinated tranches, over-collateralization, and other credit enhancement, if any, in a security structure that will generally absorb losses before we will experience a credit loss on the security. The calculated averages represent the dollar-weighted average of Alt-A other-than-temporarily impaired private-label residential MBS (dollars in thousands).

Note 8   Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio 
    
  We invest in mortgage loans through the Mortgage Partnership Finance        (MPF        program). These investments (MPF loans) are either guaranteed or insured by federal agencies, as is the case with government mortgage loans, or are credit-enhanced by the related entity that sold the loan (a participating financial institution), as is the case with conventional mortgage loans. All such investments are held for portfolio.  
    
  The following table presents certain characteristics of these investments (dollars in thousands):

Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  An allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance separately established for each identified portfolio segment, if necessary, to provide for probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the statement of condition date. To the extent necessary, an allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposure is recorded as a liability. 
    
  For additional information see Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 10   Allowance for Credit Losses in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Secured Member Credit Products 
    
  We manage our credit exposure to secured member credit products through an integrated approach that generally includes establishing a credit limit for each borrower, an ongoing review of each borrower's financial condition, and collateral and lending policies that are intended to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , none of our secured member credit products outstanding were past due, on nonaccrual status, or considered impaired. In addition, there were no troubled debt restructurings related to credit products during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Based upon the collateral held as security, our credit extension and collateral policies, management's credit analysis, and the repayment history on secured member credit products, we have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on our secured member credit products at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , no liability to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures was recorded. See Note 18   Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on our off-balance-sheet credit exposure.

Based on our assessment of our servicers for our government loans, there is no allowance for credit losses for the government mortgage loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . In addition, these mortgage loans are not placed on nonaccrual status due to the government guarantee or insurance on these loans and the contractual obligation of the loan servicers to repurchase their related loans when certain criteria are met. 
    
  For additional information see Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 10   Allowance for Credit Losses in the 2015 Annual Report.

  Credit Quality Indicators.   Key credit quality indicators for mortgage loans include the migration of past due loans, nonaccrual loans, loans in process of foreclosure, and impaired loans. The tables below set forth certain key credit quality indicators for our investments in mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

  Collectively Evaluated Mortgage Loans.   We evaluate the credit risk of our investments in conventional mortgage loans for impairment on a collective basis that considers loan-pool-specific attribute data at the master commitment pool level, including historical delinquency migration, applies estimated loss severities, and incorporates available credit enhancements to establish our best estimate of probable incurred losses at the reporting date. Migration analysis is a methodology for estimating the rate of default experienced on pools of similar loans based on our historical experience. We apply migration analysis to conventional loans that are currently not past due, loans that are 30 to 59 days past due, 60 to 89 days past due, and 90 to 179 days past due. We then estimate the dollar amount of loans in these categories that we believe are likely to migrate to a realized loss position and apply a loss severity factor to estimate losses that would be incurred at the statement of condition date. The losses are then reduced by the probable cash flows resulting from available credit enhancement. Credit enhancement cash flows that are projected and assessed as not probable of receipt are not considered in reducing estimated losses. 
    
  Individually Evaluated Mortgage Loans.   Certain conventional mortgage loans, primarily impaired mortgage loans that are considered collateral-dependent, may be specifically identified for purposes of calculating the allowance for credit losses. A mortgage loan is considered collateral-dependent if repayment is only expected to be provided by the sale of the underlying property, that is, if it is considered likely that the borrower will default and there is no credit enhancement from a participating financial institution to offset losses under the master commitment. The estimated credit losses on impaired collateral-dependent loans may be separately determined because sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the inherent loss on these loans on an individual loan basis. Loans that are considered collateral-dependent are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs. The resulting incurred loss is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Additionally, for our investments in loans modified under our temporary loan modification plan, on the effective date of a loan modification we measure the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate and reduce the carrying value of the loan accordingly. 
    
  Charge-Off Policy.   A charge-off is recorded if it is estimated that the recorded investment in a loan will not be recovered. We evaluate whether to record a charge-off on a conventional mortgage loan upon the occurrence of a confirming event. Confirming events include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of foreclosure or notification of a claim against any of the credit enhancements. We charge off the portion of outstanding conventional mortgage loan balances in excess of fair value of the underlying property, less cost to sell and adjusted for any available credit enhancements for loans that are 180 or more days past due, when the borrower has filed for bankruptcy protection and the loan is at least 30 days past due, or when there is evidence of fraud.

  REO.   At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $2.4 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively, in assets classified as REO. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we sold REO assets with a recorded carrying value of   $3.2 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively. Upon the sale of these REO properties, and inclusive of any proceeds received from primary mortgage-insurance coverage, we recognized net gains totaling   $476,000   and $  600,000   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Cash collateral and related accrued interest posted was   $204.0 million   and   $92.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The change in cash collateral posted is included in the net change in interest-bearing deposits in the statement of cash flows. Cash collateral and related accrued interest received was   $750,000   at   December 31, 2015  .

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges because the original forecasted transactions were not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within a two-month period thereafter. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is   eight years  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of deferred net losses on derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months is   $14.2 million  . 
    
  Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives.   We enter into derivatives that we clear (cleared derivatives) with a derivatives clearing organization (DCO), our counterparty for such derivatives. We also enter into derivatives that are not cleared (bilateral derivatives) under master-netting agreements. Certain of our bilateral derivatives master-netting agreements contain provisions that require us to post additional collateral with our bilateral derivatives counterparties if our credit ratings are lowered. Under the terms that govern such agreements, if our credit rating is lowered by Moody's Investor Services (Moody's) or Standard and Poor's Rating Service (S P) to a certain level, we are required to deliver additional collateral on uncleared derivatives in a net

liability position. In the event of a split between such credit ratings, the lower rating governs. The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivatives with these provisions that were in a net-liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) at   September 30, 2016  , was   $486.8 million   for which we had delivered cash or securities collateral with a post-haircut value of   $438.2 million   in accordance with the terms of the master-netting agreements. Securities collateral is subject to valuation haircuts in accordance with the terms of the master-netting agreements. The following table sets forth the post-haircut value of incremental collateral that certain uncleared derivatives counterparties could have required us to deliver based on incremental credit rating downgrades at   September 30, 2016  . 

_______________________ 
           (1) 
    Ratings are expressed in this table according to S P's conventions but include the equivalent of such rating by Moody's. If there is a split rating, the lower rating is used. 
       
  For cleared derivatives, the DCO determines initial margin requirements. We clear our trades via clearing members of the DCOs. These clearing members who act as our agent to the DCOs are U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) - registered futures commission merchants. Our clearing members may require us to post margin in excess of DCO requirements based on our credit or other considerations, including but not limited to, credit rating downgrades. We were not required to post any such excess margin by our clearing members based on credit considerations at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Offsetting of Certain Derivatives.   We present derivatives, any related cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, received or pledged, and associated accrued interest, on a net basis by counterparty. 
    
  The following table presents separately the fair value of derivatives that are subject to netting due to a legal right of offset based on the terms of our master netting arrangements or similar agreements as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   and the fair value of derivatives that are not subject to such netting (dollars in thousands). Such netting includes any related cash collateral received from or pledged to counterparties.

Note 14   Capital 
    
  We are subject to capital requirements under our capital plan, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (the FHLBank Act), and FHFA regulations: 
    
           1. 
    Risk-based capital.   We are required to maintain at all times permanent capital, defined as Class B stock, including Class B stock classified as mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings, in an amount at least equal to the sum of our credit-risk capital requirement, market-risk capital requirement, and operations-risk capital requirement, calculated in accordance with FHFA rules and regulations, referred to herein as the risk-based capital requirement. Only permanent capital satisfies the risk-based capital requirement. 
       
           2. 
    Total regulatory capital.   We are required to maintain at all times a total capital-to-assets ratio of at least   four percent  . Total regulatory capital is the sum of permanent capital, the amount paid-in for Class A stock, the amount of any general loss allowance if consistent with GAAP and not established for specific assets, and other amounts from sources determined by the FHFA as available to absorb losses. We have never issued Class A stock. 
       
           3. 
    Leverage capital.   We are required to maintain at all times a leverage capital-to-assets ratio of at least   five percent  . Leverage capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted   1.5   times and all other capital without a weighting factor. 

30

Note 16   Employee Retirement Plans 
    
  Qualified Defined Benefit Multiemployer Plan.   We participate in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan), a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan is treated as a multiemployer plan for accounting purposes, but operates as a multiple-employer plan

     Table of Contents  

under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, certain multiemployer plan disclosures are not applicable to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan. 
    
  Qualified Defined Contribution Plan.   We also participate in the Pentegra Defined Contribution Plan for Financial Institutions, a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. The plan covers substantially all of our employees. We contribute a percentage of the participants' compensation by making a matching contribution equal to a percentage of voluntary employee contributions, subject to certain limitations. Our matching contributions are charged to compensation and benefits expense. 
    
  Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan.   We also maintain the Thrift Benefit Equalization Plan, a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan covering certain of our senior officers and directors. The plan's liability consists of the accumulated compensation deferrals and the accumulated earnings on these deferrals. We maintain a rabbi trust, which is recorded in other assets on the statement of condition, intended to satisfy future benefit obligations. 
    
  The following table sets forth our net pension costs under our defined benefit plan and expenses relating to our defined contribution plans (dollars in thousands): 

Nonqualified Supplemental Defined Benefit Retirement Plan.   We also maintain a nonqualified, single-employer unfunded defined-benefit plan covering certain senior officers, for which our obligation is detailed below. We maintain a rabbi trust, which is recorded in other assets on the statement of condition, intended to satisfy future benefit obligations. 
    
  Postretirement Benefits.   We sponsor a fully insured postretirement benefit program that includes life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. We provide life insurance to all employees who retire on or after age 55 after completing six years of service. No contributions are required from the retirees. There are no funded plan assets that have been designated to provide postretirement benefits.

Note 17   Fair Values 
    
  A fair-value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. A description of the application of the fair-value hierarchy, valuation techniques, and significant inputs is disclosed in Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 18   Fair Values in the 2015 Annual Report. There have been no material changes in the fair-value hierarchy classification of financial assets and liabilities, valuation techniques, or significant inputs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The carrying values, fair values, and fair-value hierarchy of our financial instruments at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (dollars in thousands). These fair values do not represent an estimate of our overall market value as a going concern, which would take into account, among other things, our future business opportunities and the net profitability of our assets and liabilities.

  Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  We measure certain held-to-maturity investment securities, mortgage loans held for portfolio, and REO at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair-value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, upon recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment on a held-to-maturity security). 
    
  The following tables present financial assets by level within the fair-value hierarchy which were recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and year ended   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

Note 18   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Joint and Several Liability.   COs are backed by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. The FHFA has authority to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal and interest on COs for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. No FHLBank has ever been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any CO on behalf of another FHLBank. We evaluate the financial condition of the other FHLBanks primarily based on known regulatory actions, publicly available financial information, and individual long-term credit-rating action as of each period-end presented. Based on this evaluation, as of   September 30, 2016  , and through the filing of this report, we believe there is a remote likelihood that we will be required to repay the principal or interest on any CO on behalf of another FHLBank. 
    
  We have considered applicable FASB guidance and determined it is not necessary to recognize a liability for the fair value of our joint and several liability for all of the COs. The joint and several obligation is mandated by FHFA regulations and is not the result of an arms-length transaction among the FHLBanks. The FHLBanks have no control over the amount of the guaranty or the determination of how each FHLBank would perform under the joint and several obligation. Because the FHLBanks are subject to the authority of the FHFA as it relates to decisions involving the allocation of the joint and several liability for the FHLBanks' COs, each FHLBank's joint and several obligation is excluded from the initial recognition and measurement provisions. Accordingly, we have not recognized a liability for our joint and several obligation related to other FHLBanks' COs at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The par amounts of other FHLBanks' outstanding COs for which we are jointly and severally liable totaled $  911.8 billion   and   $851.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See Note 12   Consolidated Obligations for additional information. 
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Commitments 
    
  The following table sets forth our off-balance-sheet commitments as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

__________________________ 
           (1) 
    The amount of standby letters of credit outstanding excludes commitments to issue standby letters of credit that expire within one year. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , these amounts totaled $  22.5 million   and   $27.3 million  , respectively. Also excluded are commitments to issue standby letters of credit that expire after one year totaling   $4.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
              (2) 
    Commitments for unused line-of-credit advances are generally for periods of up to   12 months  . Since many of these commitments are not expected to be drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily indicate future liquidity requirements. 
        
  Standby Letters of Credit.     A standby letter of credit is a financing arrangement pursuant to which we agree for a fee to fund the associated obligation to a third-party beneficiary should the primary obligor fail to fund such obligation. If we are required to make payment for a beneficiary's draw, our strategy is to take prompt action to recover the funds paid to the third-party beneficiary, including converting the payment amount into a collateralized advance to the primary obligor, withdrawing the payment amount from the primary obligor s demand deposit account with us, or selling collateral pledged by the primary obligor in a commercially reasonable manner to offset the payment amount. The original terms of these standby letters of credit have original expiration periods of up to   20 years  , currently expiring no later than   2024  . Our unearned fees for the value of the guarantees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in other liabilities and totaled   $734,000   and   $831,000   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Commitments to Invest in Mortgage Loans.   Commitments to invest in mortgage loans are generally for periods not to exceed   45   business days. Such commitments are recorded as derivatives at their fair values on the statement of condition. 
    
  Pledged Collateral.   We have pledged securities, as collateral, related to derivatives. See Note 10   Derivatives and Hedging Activities for additional information about our pledged collateral and other credit-risk-related contingent features. 
    
  Legal Proceedings  . We are subject to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business from time to time. We would record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Note 19   Transactions with Shareholders 
    
  Related Parties.   We define related parties as members with   10 percent   or more of the voting interests of our capital stock outstanding. Under the FHLBank Act and FHFA regulations, each member directorship is designated to one of the six states in our district. Each member eligible to vote is entitled to cast by ballot one vote for each share of stock that it was required to hold as of the record date, which is December 31, of the year prior to each election, subject to the limitation that no member may cast more votes than the average number of shares of our stock that is required to be held by all members located in such member's state. Eligible members are permitted to vote all their eligible shares for one candidate for each open member directorship in the state in which the member is located and for each open independent directorship. A nonmember stockholder is not entitled to cast votes for the election of directors unless it was a member as of the record date. At   September 30, 2016  ,

     Table of Contents  

and   December 31, 2015  , no shareholder owned more than   10 percent   of the total voting interests due to statutory limits on members' voting rights, therefore, we did not have any related parties. 
    
  Shareholder Concentrations.   We consider shareholder concentrations as members or nonmembers whose capital stock holdings (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) are in excess of   10 percent   of total capital stock outstanding. The following tables present transactions with shareholders whose holdings of capital stock exceed   10 percent   or more of total capital stock outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

We held sufficient collateral to support the advances to the above institution such that we do not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances. 
    
  We recognized interest income on outstanding advances and fees on letters of credit from Citizens Bank, N.A. during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Transactions with Directors' Institutions.   We provide, in the ordinary course of business, products and services to members whose officers or directors serve on our board of directors. In accordance with FHFA regulations, transactions with directors' institutions are conducted on the same terms as those with any other member. 
    
  The following table presents the outstanding balances of capital stock, advances, and accrued interest receivable with members whose officers or directors serve on our board of directors, and those balances as a percentage of our total balance as reported on our statement of condition (dollars in thousands): 

Note 20   Subsequent Events 
    
  On   October 28, 2016  , the board of directors declared a cash dividend at an annualized rate of   3.80 percent   based on capital stock balances outstanding during the third quarter of 2016. The dividend, including dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock, amounted to   $23.2 million   and was paid on   November 2, 2016  .

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
    
  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , our net income increased to   $36.6 million   from   $30.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was largely due to an   $8.6 million   increase of net interest income partially offset by $2.3 million of interest-rate subsidies under the Jobs for New England and Helping to House New England programs, subsidized advance programs that support members  small business lending and affordable rental and homeownership initiatives, respectively. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was   $64.8 million   compared with   $56.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily attributable to a   $3.2 billion   increase in average earning assets consisting of a   $4.3 billion   increase in average advances balances that was partially offset by a   $1.1 billion   decrease in average investments balances. Also offsetting the benefit from the increase in average earning assets was a   $1.5 million   decrease in net prepayment fees from advances and investments from   $1.5 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , to   $50,000   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . Our retained earnings were   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , a surplus of   $480.1 million   over our minimum retained earnings target. We continued to satisfy all regulatory capital requirements as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  On   October 28, 2016  , our board of directors declared a cash dividend that was equivalent to an annual yield of   3.80 percent  , the approximate daily average three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) yield for the   third   quarter of   2016   plus 300 basis points.  
    
  Net Interest Margin 
    
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , net interest margin was   0.45 percent  , compared with   0.41 percent   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily attributable to the increase of higher-yielding long term assets such as long-term advances and mortgage-backed securities.  
    
  Advances Balances 
    
  Advances balances increased to   $37.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $36.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The   $1.1 billion   increase was concentrated in fixed-rate putable advances and variable-rate advances. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the average balance of total advances was   $36.0 billion  , compared to   $31.7 billion   during the same period in   2015  . The   $4.3 billion   increase was broad-based, with the largest increases in variable-rate advances and short-term advances. We cannot predict whether this trend will continue. 
    
  Accretable yields from investments in private-label MBS 
    
  For both the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized   $9.6 million   in interest income resulting from the increased accretable yields of certain private-label MBS for which we had previously recognized credit losses. For a discussion of this accounting treatment, see Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Notes to the Financial Statements   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Investment Securities   Other-than-Temporary Impairment   Interest Income Recognition. 
    
  The amortized cost of our total investments in private-label MBS and ABS backed by home-equity loans has declined to   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Other-than-temporary impairment credit losses were   $371,000   for the quarter ending   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Excess Stock Management Program

     Table of Contents  

Under the excess stock management program adopted by our board of directors on July 24, 2015, we repurchased   $105.0 million   in excess stock in the third quarter of 2016. For additional information see   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Internal Capital Practices and Policies   Excess Stock Management Program. 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
    
  Economic Environment 
    
  Economic data from third quarter 2016 suggests that the labor market has continued to strengthen and the pace of economic activity has increased compared to the first half of the year. While the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been consistent, on average. Household spending has grown, but business fixed investment has remained soft. The New England economy generally continues to improve, but at a moderately slower pace than the rest of the U.S. economy. Unemployment rates across the six New England states were relatively stable, on average, in the third quarter.  
    
  Interest-Rate Environment 
    
  On November 2, 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0.25 to 0.5 percent. The federal funds target rate had remained constant at zero to 0.25 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter 2015 until it was raised in the fourth quarter of 2015. Long-term interest rates increased slightly from July through September. 
    
  The following table illustrates the interest-rate environment.

  Net income increased to   $36.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $30.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , largely due to an increase of   $8.6 million   of net interest income partially offset by $2.3 million subsidies for Jobs for New England and Helping to House New England programs. 
    
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016  , Compared with Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Net income decreased to   $113.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $213.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , largely due to a decrease of   $115.1 million   in litigation settlement income, offset in part by an   $8.4 million   increase in net interest income after reduction of provision for credit losses. 
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Third Quarter of 2016 Compared with Third Quarter of 2015 
    
  Net interest income after reduction of provision for credit losses for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $64.9 million  , compared to   $56.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . For additional information see   Executive Summary as well as Rate and Volume Analysis.

Net interest spread was   0.39 percent   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , a   three   basis point increase from the same period in   2015  . Net interest margin was   0.45 percent   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , a   four   basis point increase from the same period in   2015  . The increase in net interest spread reflects a   16   basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets and a   13   basis point increase in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities. The expansion of net interest spread and net interest margin was primarily attributable to the increase of higher-yielding long term assets such as long-term advances and mortgage-backed securities.  
    
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016  , Compared with Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Net interest income after reduction of provision for credit losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   $175.7 million  , compared with   $167.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   $8.4 million   increase was primarily attributable to a   $3.6 billion   increase in average earning assets from   $54.7 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , to   $58.3 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The growth in average earning assets was driven by a   $4.0 billion   increase in average advances balances that was partially offset by a   $397.6 million   decrease in average investments balances. Also partially offsetting the benefit from the increase in average earning assets was a   $2.5 million   decrease in net prepayment fees from advances and investments from   $5.8 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , to   $3.3 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Net interest spread was   0.35 percent   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , a   two   basis point decrease from the same period in   2015  , and net interest margin was   0.40 percent  , a   one   basis point decrease from   2015  . The decrease in net interest spread reflects a   12   basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets and a   14   basis point increase in the average yield on interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in net interest spread and net interest margin was mainly a result of the aforementioned decrease in net prepayment fees from advances and investments.  
    
  The following table presents major categories of average balances, related interest income/expense, and average yields for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments less interest paid on COs, deposits, and other sources of funds.

  Rate and Volume Analysis 
    
  Changes in both average balances (volume) and interest rates influence changes in net interest income and net interest margin. The following table summarizes changes in interest income and interest expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but are equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes.

Average Balance of Advances Outstanding 
    
  The average balance of total advances increased   $4.0 billion  , or   12.5 percent  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . This increase of average advances balances was broad based, consisting of increases in fixed- rate short-term and long-term advances and variable-rate advances. The following table summarizes average balances of advances outstanding during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , by product type.

    Includes floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees. 
       
  In addition, the average balance of fixed-rate advances that were hedged with interest-rate swaps to yield an effective floating rate totaled   $9.0 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Therefore, a significant portion of our advances, including overnight advances, short-term fixed-rate advances, fixed-rate putable advances, certain fixed-rate bullet advances, and variable-rate advances, either earn a short-term interest rate or are swapped to a short-term index, resulting in yields that closely follow short-term market interest-rate trends. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the average balance of all such advances totaled   $28.0 billion  , representing   78.1 percent   of the total average balance of advances outstanding during that period. The average balance of all such advances totaled   $21.4 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , representing   67.3 percent   of the total average balance of advances outstanding during that period. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net prepayment fees on advances and investments were   $3.3 million   and   $5.8 million  , respectively. Prepayment-fee income is unpredictable and inconsistent from period to period, occurring only when advances and investments are prepaid prior to the scheduled maturity or repricing dates, and generally when prevailing reinvestment yields are lower than those of the prepaid advances. 
    
  Average Balance of Investments 
    
  Average short-term money market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold, decreased   $981.3 million  , or   9.6 percent  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  . The yield earned on short-term money market investments is highly correlated to short-term market interest rates. As a result of the FOMC s target range for the federal funds rate, average yields on overnight federal funds sold increased from   0.11 percent   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   0.38 percent   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , while average yields on securities purchased under agreements to resell increased from   0.09 percent   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   0.33 percent   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . These investments are used for liquidity management and to manage our leverage ratio in response to fluctuations in other asset balances. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , average balances of securities purchased under agreements to resell

decreased   $1.3 billion   and average balances of federal funds sold increased   $239.0 million   in comparison to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Average investment-securities balances increased   $587.7 million  , or   6.5 percent   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  , an increase consisting primarily of a   $597.2 million   increase in MBS. 
    
  Average Balance of COs 
    
  Average CO balances increased   $3.5 billion  , or   7.0 percent  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in   2015  , resulting from our increased funding needs principally due to the increase in our average advances balances. This overall   increase   consisted of increases of   $2.0 billion   and   $1.5 billion   in CO discount notes and CO bonds, respectively. 
    
  The average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately   49.3 percent   of total average COs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   48.8 percent   of total average COs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The average balance of CO bonds represented   50.7 percent   and   51.2 percent   of total average COs outstanding during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Impact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  Net interest income includes interest accrued on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are associated with advances, investments, deposits, and debt instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. We generally use derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as interest rate risk-management tools. These derivatives serve to stabilize net interest income and net interest margin when interest rates fluctuate. Accordingly, the impact of derivatives on net interest income and net interest margin should be viewed in the overall context of our risk-management strategy. The following tables show the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on net interest income, net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, and net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands).

  Net interest margin for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   0.45 percent   and   0.41 percent  , respectively. If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been   0.62 percent   and   0.58 percent  , respectively. 
    
  Net interest margin for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   0.40 percent   and   0.41 percent  , respectively. If derivatives had not been used as hedges to mitigate the impact of interest-rate fluctuations, net interest margin would have been   0.59 percent   for each period. 
    
  Interest paid and received on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are economic hedges is classified as net losses on derivatives and hedging activities in other income. As shown under   Other Income (Loss) below, interest accruals on derivatives classified as economic hedges totaled a net expense of   $1.4 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   interest accruals on derivatives classified as economic hedges totaled a net expense of   $4.5 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  Other Income (Loss) 
    
  The following table presents a summary of other income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

As evident in the Other Income (Loss) table above, accounting for derivatives and hedged items results in the potential for considerable timing differences between income recognition from assets or liabilities and income effects of hedging instruments entered into to mitigate interest-rate risk and cash-flow activity. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Advances 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the advances portfolio totaled   $37.2 billion  , an   increase   of $  1.1 billion   compared with $  36.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was concentrated primarily in variable-rate advances and fixed-rate putable advances.

  At   September 30, 2016  , we had advances outstanding to   314  , or   70.2 percent   of our   447   members. At   December 31, 2015  , we had advances outstanding to   321  , or   72.0 percent   of our   446   members. 
    
  Advances Credit Risk 
    
  We endeavor to minimize credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of our borrowers and by holding sufficient collateral to protect the Bank from credit losses. All pledged collateral is subject to haircuts assigned based on our opinion of the risk that such collateral presents. We are prohibited by Section 10(a) of the FHLBank Act from making advances without sufficient collateral to secure the advance. We have never experienced a credit loss on an advance. 
    
  We assign each non-insurance company borrower to one of the following three credit status categories based primarily on our assessment of the borrower's overall financial condition and other factors: 

Category-1: members that are generally in satisfactory financial condition; 
                
    Category-2: members that show weakening financial trends in key financial indices and/or regulatory findings; and 
                
    Category-3: members with financial weaknesses that present an elevated level of concern. We also place housing associates and non-member borrowers in Category-3. 
       
  We monitor the financial condition of our insurance company members quarterly. We lend to them based on our assessment of their financial condition and their pledge of sufficient amounts of eligible collateral. 
    
  The following table provides information regarding advances outstanding with our borrowers in Category-1, Category-2, Category-3, and insurance company members, at   September 30, 2016  , along with their corresponding collateral balances.

     Table of Contents  

The method by which a borrower pledges collateral is dependent upon the category to which it is assigned and on the type of collateral that the borrower pledges. Moreover, borrowers in Category-1 are permitted to specifically list and identify single-family residential mortgage loans at a lower discount than is allowed if the collateral is not specifically listed and identified. Based upon the method by which borrowers pledge collateral to us, the following table shows the total potential lending value of the collateral that borrowers have pledged to us, net of our collateral valuation discounts as of   September 30, 2016  . 

We accept nontraditional and subprime loans that are underwritten in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance as eligible collateral for our advances as discussed under Item 7       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Financial Condition       Advances Credit Risk in the 2015 Annual Report. At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of pledged nontraditional and subprime loan collateral was   nine percent   of total member discounted collateral. 
    
  We have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on credit products at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , for the reasons discussed in Item 1       Notes to the Financial Statements       Note 9       Allowance for Credit Losses.

  Investments 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , investment securities and short-term money market instruments totaled $  19.3 billion  , compared with   $18.0 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Short-term money-market investments increased by   $429.1 million   to $  9.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $8.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was attributable to an increase in federal funds sold of   $3.4 billion   offset, in part, by a decrease in securities purchased under agreements to resell of   $3.0 billion  . 
    
  Investment securities   increased   by   $816.3 million   to   $10.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $9.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was attributable to the purchase of   $399.2 million   of U.S. Treasury obligations in the third quarter of 2016 and a   $360.1 million   increase in MBS. 
    
  Our MBS investment portfolio consists of the following categories of securities as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The percentages in the table below are based on carrying value. 

See Item 1   Notes to the Financial Statements   Note 3   Trading Securities, Note 4   Available-for-Sale Securities, Note 
  5   Held-to-Maturity Securities, and Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment for additional information on our investment securities 
    
  Investments Credit Risk 
    
  We are subject to credit risk on unsecured investments consisting primarily of short-term (meaning under one year to maturity) money market instruments issued by high-quality financial institutions and long-term (original maturity in excess of one year) debentures issued or guaranteed by U.S. agencies, U.S government-owned corporations, GSEs, and supranational institutions. We place short-term funds with large, high-quality financial institutions with long-term credit ratings no lower than single-A (or equivalent) on an unsecured basis. Most of these placements expire within one business day. 
    
  In addition to these unsecured short-term investments, we also make secured investments in the form of securities purchased under agreements to resell secured by U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, whose terms to maturity are up to 35 days. We have also invested in and are subject to secured credit risk related to MBS, ABS, and HFA securities that are directly or indirectly supported by underlying mortgage loans.  
    
  We actively monitor our investments' credit exposures and the credit quality of our counterparties, including assessments of each counterparty's financial performance, capital adequacy, and sovereign support as well as related market signals. We endeavor to reduce or suspend credit limits and/or seek to reduce existing exposures, as appropriate, as a result of these monitoring activities. 
    
  Credit ratings of our investments are provided in the following table.

    The issuer rating is used for these investments, and if a rating is on negative credit watch, the rating in the next lower rating category is used and then the lowest rating is determined. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , our unsecured credit exposure related to money market instruments and debentures, including accrued interest, was   $6.8 billion   to   18   counterparties and issuers, of which   $5.5 billion   was for federal funds sold, and   $1.3 billion   was for Treasury bills, debentures issued by GSEs, and supranational institutions. As of   September 30, 2016   no issuers/counterparties individually accounted for greater than 10 percent of total unsecured credit exposure.

The table sets forth the credit ratings and summary credit enhancements associated with our private-label MBS and ABS, stratified by year of securitization. Average current credit enhancements as of   September 30, 2016  , reflect the percentage of subordinated class outstanding balances as of   September 30, 2016  , to our senior class outstanding balances as of   September 30, 2016  , weighted by the par value of our respective senior class securities. Average current credit enhancements as of   September 30, 2016  , are indicative of the ability of subordinated classes to absorb loan collateral lost principal and interest shortfall before senior classes are impacted.

Mortgage Loans 
    
  We invest in mortgages through the MPF program. The MPF program is described under   Mortgage Loans Credit Risk and 
  in Item 1   Business   Business Lines   Mortgage Loan Finance in the 2015 Annual Report. As of   September 30, 2016  , our mortgage loan investment portfolio totaled $  3.7 billion  , an   increase   of $  132.5 million   from   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Mortgage Loans Credit Risk 
    
  We are subject to credit risk from the mortgage loans in which we invest due to our exposure to the credit risk of the underlying borrowers and the credit risk of the participating financial institutions when the participating financial institutions retain credit-enhancement and/or servicing obligations. For additional information on the credit risks arising from our participation in the MPF program, see Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Financial Condition   Mortgage Loans   Mortgage Loans Credit Risk in the 2015 Annual Report.

  For information on the determination of the allowance at   September 30, 2016  , see Item 1   Notes to the Financial Statements   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses, and for information on our methodology for estimating the allowance, see Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Estimates   Allowance for Loan Losses in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  We place conventional mortgage loans on nonaccrual status when the contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Accrued interest on nonaccrual loans is reversed against interest income. We monitor the delinquency levels of the mortgage loan portfolio on a monthly basis. Our investments in conventional mortgage loans that are delinquent are shown in the following table: 

Mortgage Insurance Companies.   We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage insurance companies that provide credit enhancement in place of the participating financial institution and for primary mortgage insurance coverage on individual loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were the beneficiary of primary mortgage insurance coverage of   $76.5 million   on   $305.6 million   of conventional mortgage loans, and supplemental mortgage insurance coverage of   $18.1 million   on mortgage pools with a total unpaid principal balance of   $192.8 million  .

Bilateral and cleared derivatives outstanding are classified as assets or liabilities according to the net fair value of derivatives aggregated by each counterparty. Derivative assets' net fair value, net of cash collateral and accrued interest, totaled   $62.9 million   and   $40.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Derivative liabilities' net fair value, net of cash collateral and accrued interest, totaled $  463.8 million   and   $442.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following table presents a summary of the notional amounts and estimated fair values of our outstanding derivatives, excluding accrued interest, and related hedged item by product and type of accounting treatment as of   September 30, 2016  , and

December 31, 2015  . The notional amount represents the hypothetical principal basis used to determine periodic interest payments received and paid. However, the notional amount does not represent an actual amount exchanged or our overall exposure to credit and market risk. The hedge designation  fair value  represents the hedge classification for transactions that qualify for hedge-accounting treatment and hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate, which is LIBOR. The hedge designation "cash flow" represents the hedge classification for transactions that qualify for hedge-accounting treatment and hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. The hedge designation  economic  represents a derivative hedging specific or nonspecific assets, liabilities, or firm commitments that does not qualify or was not designated for fair-value or cash-flow hedge accounting, but are acceptable hedging strategies under our risk-management policy.

  The following tables provide a summary of our hedging relationships for fair-value hedges of advances and COs that qualify for hedge accounting by year of contractual maturity. Interest accruals on interest-rate-exchange agreements in qualifying hedge relationships are recorded as interest income on advances and interest expense on COs in the statement of operations. The notional amount of derivatives in qualifying fair-value hedge relationships of advances and COs totals $  18.2 billion  , representing   88.1 percent   of all derivatives outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . Economic hedges and cash-flow hedges are not included within the two tables below.

  We may engage in derivatives directly with affiliates of certain of our members that act as derivatives dealers to us. These derivatives are entered into for our own risk-management purposes and are not related to requests from our members to enter into such contracts. 
    
  Derivative Instruments Credit Risk.   We are subject to credit risk on derivatives. This risk arises from the risk of counterparty default on the derivative contract. The amount of unsecured credit exposure to derivative counterparty default is the amount by which the replacement cost of the defaulted derivative contract exceeds the value of any collateral held by us (if the counterparty is the net obligor on the derivative contract) or is exceeded by the value of collateral pledged by us to  
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

counterparties (if we are the net obligor on the derivative contract). We accept cash or securities collateral in accordance with the terms of the applicable master netting agreement for uncleared derivatives (principal-to-principal derivatives that are not centrally cleared) from counterparties with whom we are in a current positive fair-value position (i.e., we are in the money) by an amount that exceeds an exposure threshold (if any) defined in our master netting agreement with the counterparty. The resulting net exposure at fair value is reflected in the derivatives table below. We pledge cash and securities collateral in accordance with the terms of the applicable master netting agreement for uncleared derivatives to counterparties with whom we are in a current negative fair-value position (i.e., we are out-of-the-money) by an amount that exceeds an exposure threshold (if any) defined in our master netting agreement with the counterparty. From time to time, due to timing differences or derivatives valuation differences between our calculated derivatives values and those of our counterparties, and to the contractual haircuts applied to securities, we receive from counterparties cash or securities collateral whose fair value is less than the current positive fair-value positions with them adjusted for any applicable exposure threshold. We pledge only cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, for cleared derivatives, but may also pledge securities for initial margin as allowed by the applicable DCO and clearing member. The table below details our counterparty credit exposure as of   September 30, 2016  . 

_______________________ 
           (1) 
    Uncleared derivatives counterparty ratings are obtained from Moody's, Fitch, and S P. Each rating classification includes all rating levels within that category. If there is a split rating, the lowest rating is used. In the case where the obligations are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed, the rating of the guarantor is used. 
              (2) 
    Total fair-value exposures related to commitments to invest in mortgage loans are offset by certain pair-off fees. Commitments to invest in mortgage loans are reflected as derivatives. We do not collateralize these commitments. However, should the participating financial institution fail to deliver the mortgage loans as agreed, the participating financial institution is charged a fee to compensate us for the nonperformance. 
              (3) 
    These represent derivatives positions with counterparties for which we are in a net liability position and for which we have delivered securities collateral to the counterparty in an amount equal to or less than the net derivative liability, or derivative positions with counterparties for which we are in a net asset position and for which the counterparty has delivered collateral to us in an amount that exceeds our net derivative asset.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our financial structure is designed to enable us to expand and contract our assets, liabilities, and capital in response to changes in membership composition and member credit needs. Our primary source of liquidity is our access to the capital markets through CO issuance, which is described in Item 1   Business   Consolidated Obligations in the 2015 Annual Report. Outstanding COs and the condition of the market for COs are discussed below under   Debt Financing   Consolidated Obligations. Our equity capital resources are governed by our capital plan, certain portions of which are described under   Capital below as well as by applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Internal Liquidity Sources / Liquidity Management 
    
  We have developed a methodology and policies by which we measure and manage the Bank s short-term liquidity needs based on projected net cash flow and contingent obligations. 
    
  Projected Net Cash Flow.   We define projected net cash flow as projected sources of funds less projected uses of funds based on contractual maturities or expected option exercise periods, and settlement of committed asset and liabilities, as applicable. For mortgage-related cash flows and callable debt, we incorporate projected prepayments and call exercise. 
    
  Structural Liquidity.   We define structural liquidity as projected net cash flow (defined above) less assumed secondary uses of funds, for which we assume the following: 

all maturing advances are renewed; 
                
    member overnight deposits are withdrawn at a rate of 50 percent per day; 
                
    outstanding standby letters of credit are drawn down at a rate of 50 percent spread equally over 86 days; 
                
    uncommitted lines of credit are drawn upon at a rate of 10 percent of the previous day's balance; and 
                
    MPF master commitments are funded at a rate of 10 percent of the previous days' total amount on the first day and at a rate of one percent on each day thereafter. 
       
  The above assumptions for secondary uses of funds are in excess of our ordinary experience, and therefore represent a more stressful scenario than we expect to experience. We review these assumptions periodically. 
    
  This methodology for measuring projected net cash flow and structural liquidity has been established by management to monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis, and to help ensure that we meet all of our obligations as they come due and to meet our members' potential demand for liquidity from us in all cases. We may adjust the amount of liquidity maintained as market conditions change from time to time using projected net cash flow and structural liquidity measurements. 
    
  Liquidity Management Action Triggers.   We maintain two liquidity management action triggers: 

if structural liquidity is less than negative $1.0 billion on or before the fifth business day following the measurement date; and 
                
    if projected net cash flow falls below zero on or before the 21   st    day following the measurement date. 
       
  We did not breach either of these thresholds at any time during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . If either of these thresholds are breached, then Senior Management is notified and determines whether any corrective action is necessary.  
    
  The following table presents our projected net cash flow and structural liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

Contingency Liquidity.   FHFA regulations require that we hold contingency liquidity in an amount sufficient to enable us to cover our operational requirements for a minimum of five business days without access to the CO debt markets. The FHFA defines contingency liquidity as projected sources of funds less uses of funds, excluding reliance on access to the CO debt markets and including funding a portion of outstanding standby letters of credit. For this purpose, outstanding standby letters of credit are assumed to be drawn down at a rate of 50 percent spread equally over 86 days following the measurement date. As defined by FHFA regulations, additional contingent sources of liquidity include the following: 

marketable securities with a maturity greater than one week and less than one year that can be sold;  
                
    self-liquidating assets with a maturity of seven days or less; 
                
    assets that are generally accepted as collateral in the repurchase agreement market, for which we include 50 percent of unencumbered marketable securities with a maturity greater than one year; and 
                
    irrevocable lines of credit from financial institutions rated not lower than the second highest rating category by an NRSRO. 
       
  We complied with this regulatory requirement at all times during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we held a surplus of   $12.6 billion   and $12.0 billion, respectively, of contingency liquidity for the following five business days, exclusive of access to the proceeds of CO debt issuance. 
    
  The following table presents our contingency liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   69 

     Table of Contents  

Additional Liquidity Requirements.   In addition, certain FHFA guidance requires us to maintain sufficient liquidity through short-term investments in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. One scenario assumes that we cannot borrow funds from the capital markets for a period of 15 business days and that during that time we do not renew any maturing, prepaid, and put or called advances. The second scenario assumes that we cannot raise funds in the capital markets for five business days and that during that period we will renew maturing and called advances for all members except very large, highly rated members. We were in compliance with these liquidity requirements at all times during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Balance Sheet Funding Gap Policy.   Further, we are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate funding balance between our assets and liabilities and maintain a policy that limits the potential gap between assets inclusive of projected prepayments, maturing in one year or longer (excluding floating rate advances indexed to discount note yields), funded by liabilities, inclusive of projected calls, maturing in less than one year. The established policy limits this imbalance to a gap of 20 percent of total assets and sets a management action trigger at a gap of 10 percent of total assets. We maintained compliance with this limit and its management action trigger at all times during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , this gap averaged   3.3 percent   (the maximum level at any month-end during the quarter was   6.1 percent   and the minimum level at any month-end during the quarter was   1.2 percent  ). As of   September 30, 2016  , this gap was   2.5 percent  , compared with   5.0 percent   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We are focused on maintaining a liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities. The FHLBanks work collectively to manage the System-wide liquidity and funding management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the System s collective risk arising out of an inability to fully access the capital markets to fund our obligations. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, we may consider contractual maturities of our financial assets, as  
  
   70 

     Table of Contents  

well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations) and other factors in our discretion. 
    
  External Sources of Liquidity 
    
  FHLBank P I Funding Contingency Plan Agreement.   We have a source of emergency external liquidity through the FHLBank P I Funding Contingency Plan Agreement as discussed in Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   External Sources of Liquidity in the 2015 Annual Report. We have never drawn funding under this agreement. 
    
  Debt Financing       Consolidated Obligations 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , outstanding COs, including both CO bonds and CO discount notes, totaled $  56.1 billion   and   $53.9 billion  , respectively.  
    
  CO bonds outstanding for which we are primarily liable at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , include issued callable bonds totaling $  4.2 billion   and   $3.6 billion  , respectively. 
    
  CO discount notes comprised   51.2 percent   and   52.8 percent   of the outstanding COs for which we are primarily liable at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, but accounted for   88.1 percent   and   92.8 percent   of the proceeds from the issuance of such COs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Financial Conditions for Consolidated Obligations 
    
  We have experienced relatively low CO issuance costs during the period covered by this report, reflecting the low interest-rate environment together with continuing investor preferences for low-risk investments. We have experienced good market demand for all tenors of COs with the strongest demand for short-term COs, and have been able to issue debt in the amounts and structures required to meet our funding and risk-management needs. During the period covered by this report, CO yield spreads appeared to be trending back to historical averages relative to market benchmarks, including U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury Notes. Investor demand for COs during the period remained strong and stable. We note that capacity among our CO underwriters has been occasionally somewhat constrained as a result of the imposition of higher capital requirements on many of our underwriters. So far, this development has not impeded our ability to meet our funding needs. 
    
  Capital 
    
  Total capital was   $3.2 billion   and   $3.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The FHLBank Act and FHFA regulations specify that each FHLBank is required to satisfy certain minimum regulatory capital requirements. We were in compliance with these requirements at   September 30, 2016  , as discussed in Item 1   Notes to the Financial Statements   Note 14   Capital. 
    
  Subject to applicable law following the expiry of the stock redemption period (which is five years for Class B stock), we redeem capital stock for any member that requests redemption of its excess stock, gives notice of intent to withdraw from membership, or becomes a nonmember due to merger, acquisition, charter termination, or involuntary termination of membership. Capital stock subject to a stock redemption period is reclassified to mandatorily redeemable capital stock in the liability section of the statement of condition. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaled   $33.8 million   and   $42.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For additional information on the redemption of our capital stock, see Item 1   Business   Capital Resources   Redemption of Excess Stock and Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Notes to the Financial Statements   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  The following table sets forth the amount of mandatorily redeemable capital stock by year of expiry of the redemption-notice period at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands).

    Amount represents mandatorily redeemable capital stock that has reached the end of the five-year redemption-notice period but the member-related activity remains outstanding. Accordingly, these shares of stock will not be redeemed until the activity is no longer outstanding. 
              (2) 
    Consists of reclassifications to mandatorily redeemable capital stock resulting from an FHFA rule effective February 19, 2016, that makes captive insurance companies ineligible for membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014, will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2021. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members on or after September 12, 2014, will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2017. 
       
  We have the authority, but are not obliged, to repurchase excess stock, at our discretion, subject to continuing to meet all of our minimum capital requirements, as discussed under Item 1   Business   Capital Resources   Repurchase of Excess Stock in the 2015 Annual Report. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , excess capital stock totaled   $78.1 million   and   $158.9 million  , respectively, as set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands):

           (1) 
    Total stock-investment requirement is rounded up to the nearest $100 on an individual member basis. 
              (2)    
    Class B capital stock outstanding includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
       
  Repurchases of excess stock have led to reductions in our capital levels, including reductions to mandatorily redeemable capital stock from   $42.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $33.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Dividend payments on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are classified as interest expense, so the repurchase of this stock should lead to a reduction in interest expense, all other things being equal. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounted to   $334,000   compared with   $472,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounted to   $1.0 million   compared with   $1.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Capital Rule 
    
  The FHFA's regulation on FHLBank capital classification and critical capital levels (the Capital Rule), among other things, establishes criteria for four capital classifications and corrective action requirements for FHLBanks that are classified in any classification other than adequately capitalized. The Capital Rule requires the Director of the FHFA to determine on no less than a quarterly basis the capital classification of each FHLBank. By letter dated September 20, 2016, the Director of the FHFA notified us that, based on June 30, 2016 financial information, we met the definition of adequately capitalized under the Capital Rule.  
    
  For additional information on the Capital Rule, see Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Capital   Capital Rule in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Internal Capital Practices and Policies 

72 

     Table of Contents  

We also take steps as we believe prudent beyond legal or regulatory requirements in an effort to protect our capital, reflected in our targeted capital ratio operating range, internal minimum capital requirement in excess of regulatory requirements, minimum retained earnings target, and limitations on dividends. 
    
  Targeted Capital Ratio Operating Range 
    
  We target our operating capital ratio to be within the range of 4.0 percent to 7.5 percent. Our capital ratio was   5.9 percent   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Internal Minimum Capital Requirement in Excess of Regulatory Requirements 
    
  To provide further protection for our capital base, we maintain an internal minimum capital requirement whereby the amount of paid-in capital stock and retained earnings (together, our actual regulatory capital) must exceed four percent of our total assets plus an amount we measure as our risk exposure with 99 percent confidence using our economic capital model (together, our internal minimum capital requirement). As of   September 30, 2016  , this internal minimum capital requirement equaled   $3.0 billion  , which was satisfied by our actual regulatory capital of   $3.5 billion  . 
    
  Excess Stock Management Program 
    
  On July 24, 2015, our board of directors authorized management to implement an excess stock management program, under which we are authorized to repurchase excess stock to target a range for excess stock between zero and $200 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , our shareholders held   $78.1 million   in excess stock. We used the Excess Stock Management program in the third quarter of 2016, to unilaterally repurchase   $105.0 million   of excess stock from shareholders on a pro rata basis.  
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
    
  Our significant off-balance-sheet arrangements consist of the following: 

commitments that obligate us for additional advances; 
                 
    standby letters of credit; 
                 
    commitments for unused lines-of-credit advances; and 
                 
    unsettled COs. 
       
  Off-balance-sheet arrangements are more fully discussed in Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Notes to the Financial Statements   Note 19   Commitments and Contingencies in the 2015 Annual Report. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (if applicable), and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. Although management believes these judgments, estimates, and assumptions to be reasonably accurate, actual results may differ. 
    
  We have identified five accounting estimates that we believe are critical because they require us to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These estimates include accounting for derivatives, the use of fair-value estimates, accounting for deferred premiums and discounts on prepayable assets, the allowance for loan losses, and other-than-temporary-impairment of investment securities. The Audit Committee of our board of directors has reviewed these estimates. The assumptions involved in applying these policies are discussed in Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not made any significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in applying our critical accounting policies and estimates from those used to prepare our audited financial statements.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS 
    
  Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below. 
  Minority and Women Inclusion.   On October 27, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to its Minority and Women Inclusion regulations that, if adopted, would clarify the scope of the FHLBanks  obligation to promote diversity and ensure inclusion, in part by greatly expanding recordkeeping and reporting requirements. These proposed amendments update existing Finance Agency regulations aimed at promoting diversity and the inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities in all Bank business and activities, including management, employment and contracting. 
    
  The proposed amendments would: 

require the FHLBanks to develop standalone diversity and inclusion strategic plans or incorporate diversity and inclusion into their existing strategic planning processes and adopt strategies for promoting diversity and ensuring inclusion; 
                
    encourage the FHLBanks to expand contracting opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities through subcontracting arrangements; 
                
    require the FHLBanks to amend their policies on equal opportunity in employment and contracting by adding sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as a parent to the list of protected classifications; and 
                
    require the FHLBanks in their annual reports to the Finance Agency to provide extensive data on contracting and detailed descriptions of their efforts to advance diversity and inclusion through capital market transactions, affordable housing and community investment programs, initiatives to improve access to mortgage credit, and strategies for promoting the diversity of supervisors and managers.  
       
  Comments on the proposed amendments are due by December 27, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed amendments, if adopted, on the Bank.  
    
  FHLBank Membership for Non-Federally-Insured Credit Unions  . On September 28, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to regulations governing FHLBank membership that would implement statutory amendments to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the Bank Act) authorizing FHLBanks to accept applications for membership from state-chartered credit unions without Federal share insurance, provided that certain prerequisites have been met. The new rule, if adopted, would generally treat these credit unions the same as other depository institutions with an additional requirement that they obtain an affirmative statement from their state regulator that they meet the requirements for Federal insurance as of the date of their application for FHLBank membership; a written statement from the state regulator that it cannot or will not make any determination regarding eligibility for Federal insurance; or if the regulator fails or refuses to respond to the credit union s request within six months, confirmation of the failure to receive a response. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by November 28, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but do not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially impact the Bank.  
    
  Indemnification Payments.   On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by an FHLBank or the OF to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by the Finance Agency are only permitted if they relate to: 

premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or prior to September 20, 2016. 
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action initiated by the Finance Agency. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule on the Bank.

FHLBank New Business Activities.   On August 23, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed a rule that, if adopted, would reduce the scope of new business activities (NBAs) for which a FHLBank must seek approval from the Finance Agency and would establish more certain timelines for Finance Agency review and approval of NBA notices. The proposed rule also would clarify the protocol for Finance Agency review of NBAs. Under the proposed rule, acceptance of new types of legally permissible collateral by the FHLBanks would not constitute a new business activity or require approval from the Finance Agency prior to acceptance. Instead, the Finance Agency would review new collateral types as part of the annual exam process.  
    
  On October 24, 2016, the FHLBanks provided comments to the proposed rule, which primarily related to certain procedures under the proposed rule. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact the Bank. 
    
  Other Significant Developments 
    
  Mandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs).   On August 19, 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a proposed rule, which, if adopted, would require certain systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) regulated by the OCC to limit a counterparty s immediate termination or exercise of default rights in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the SIFI or an affiliate of the SIFI. Covered QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (know as  repos ) and reserve repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On May 3, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issued a substantively identical proposed rule with respect to QFCs entered into with globally systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs) and their affiliates that are subject to regulation in the U.S. Further, on October 26, 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a parallel proposed rule applicable to certain FDIC-supervised institutions. 
    
  The FHLBanks provided comments on the FRB proposed rule on August 5, 2016 and to the OCC proposed rule on October 18, 2016, which primarily seek clarification of an exemption and the recognition of a safe harbor. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact the Bank. 
    
  European Union (EU) Market Abuse Regulation  . The EU issued updated Market Abuse Regulations (MAR) that became effective July 3, 2016, and which contain rules on insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation for debt and equity securities on European securities exchanges, which differ in certain respects from U.S. regulations. MAR applies to issuers with securities admitted to trading on EU exchanges, including EU exchanges on which FHLBank COs are listed. MAR contains an exemption to its requirements for certain public bodies and central banks of third countries. The OF and the FHLBanks are examining whether this exemption applies. If the exemption does not apply, we anticipate that the most significant impact of the MAR on us will be more stringent and detailed recordkeeping, creation of detailed lists on parties who have access to inside information, and notification requirements. 
    
  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 4210 establishing margin requirements on certain  to-be-announced    (  TBA) transactions  . On June 15, 2016, the SEC approved a proposed rule by FINRA to require the margining of certain TBA transactions. Specifically, the approved FINRA Rule 4210 will require FINRA members to collect from, but not post to, their customer s maintenance margin (i.e. initial margin) and variation margin on transactions that are  Covered Agency Transactions,  subject to certain exemptions. A  Covered Agency Transaction  includes (certain terms are defined under FINRA rules): 

TBA transactions inclusive of adjustable-rate mortgage transactions, and Specified Pool Transactions, for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than one business day; and 
                
    Collateralized mortgage obligations issued in conformity with a program of an agency or a GSE for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than three business days. 
       
  Covered Agency Transactions in multifamily housing securities are exempt from the margin requirements provided that certain requirements are met.  
    
  Under the rule, we are exempt from posting initial margin but would be required to post variation margin to their FINRA-member counterparty in connection with covered transactions, provided the Bank has more than $10 million in gross open positions with the counterparty. FINRA members will be required to comply with the new margin requirements beginning in December 2017.  
    
  We are currently assessing the financial and operational impacts of this rule on the Bank. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  
   75 

     Table of Contents  

Sources and Types of Market and Interest-Rate Risk 
    
  Our balance sheet is comprised of different portfolios that require different types of market- and interest-rate-risk management strategies. Sources and types of market and interest-rate risk are described in Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Sources and Types of Market and Interest-Rate Risk in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Strategies to Manage Market and Interest-Rate Risk 
    
  General 
    
  We use various strategies and techniques in an effort to manage our market and interest-rate risk including the following and combinations of the following: 

the issuance of COs that can be used to match interest-rate-risk exposures of our assets (at   September 30, 2016  , fixed-rate noncallable debt, not hedged by interest-rate swaps, amounted to   $13.9 billion  , compared with   $14.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  ); 
                
    the use of derivatives and/or COs with embedded call options to hedge the interest-rate risk of our debt (at   September 30, 2016  , fixed-rate callable debt not hedged by interest-rate swaps amounted to   $175.0 million   compared with   $1.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  ); 
                
    the issuance of CO bonds together with interest-rate swaps that receive a coupon that offsets the bond coupon and any optionality embedded in the bond, thereby effectively creating a floating-rate liability (total CO bond debt used in conjunction with interest-rate-exchange agreements, was   $8.3 billion  , or   30.4 percent   of our total outstanding CO bonds at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $6.4 billion  , or   25.2 percent   of total outstanding CO bonds, at   December 31, 2015  ; 
                
    contractual provisions for certain advances that require borrowers to pay us prepayment fees, to make us financially indifferent if the borrower prepays such advances prior to maturity; and 
                
    the use of callable debt for a portion of our investments in mortgage loans to manage the interest-rate and prepayment risks from these investments. 
       
  Each of the foregoing strategies and techniques is more fully discussed under Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Strategies to Manage Market and Interest-Rate Risk in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Measurement of Market and Interest-Rate Risk and Related Policy Constraints 
    
  We measure our exposure to market and interest-rate risk using several techniques applied to the balance sheet and to certain portfolios within the balance sheet. Principal among these measurements as applied to the balance sheet is the potential future change in market value of equity (MVE) and interest income due to potential changes in interest rates, interest-rate volatility, spreads, and market prices. We also measure Value at Risk (VaR), duration of equity, convexity, and the other metrics discussed below. 
    
  MVE is the net economic value of total assets and liabilities, including any off-balance-sheet items. In contrast to the GAAP-based shareholder's equity account, MVE represents the shareholder's equity account in present-value terms. Specifically, MVE equals the difference between the estimated market value of our assets and the estimated market value of our liabilities, net of the estimated market value of all derivatives. 
    
  MVE, and in particular, the ratio of MVE to the book value of equity (BVE), is a measure of the current value of shareholder investment based on market rates, spreads, prices, and volatility at the reporting date. BVE is equal to our permanent capital, which consists of the par value of capital stock including mandatorily redeemable capital stock, plus retained earnings. However, we caution that care must be taken to properly interpret the results of the MVE analysis as the basis for these valuations may not be fully representative of future realized prices. Further, valuations are based on market curves and prices respective of individual assets, liabilities, and derivatives, and therefore are not representative of future net income to be earned by us through the spread between asset market curves and the market curves for funding costs. MVE should not be considered indicative of our market value as a going concern because it does not consider future new business activities, risk-management strategies, or the net profitability of assets after funding costs are subtracted. 
    
  We measure our exposure to market and interest-rate risk using several metrics, including: 

the ratio of MVE to BVE; 
     
   76 

     Table of Contents  

the ratio of MVE to the par value of our Class B Stock (Par Stock), which we refer to as the MVE to Par Stock ratio; 
                
    the ratio of MVE to the market value of assets, which we refer to as the economic capital ratio; 
                
    VaR, which measures the change in our MVE to a 99th percent confidence interval, based on a set of stress scenarios (VaR Stress Scenarios) using historical interest-rate and volatility movements that have been observed over six-month intervals starting at the most recent month-end and going back monthly to 1992; 
                
    duration of equity, which measures percentage change to market value for a 100 basis point shift in rates; 
                
    MVE sensitivity, which is the percent change in MVE in various shocked interest rate scenarios vs. base case MVE; 
                
    the duration gap of our assets and liabilities, which is the difference between the estimated durations (percentage change in market value for a 100 basis point shift in rates) of assets and liabilities (including the effect of related hedges) and reflects the extent to which estimated sensitivities to market changes, including, but not limited to, maturity and repricing cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched; 
                
    targeted metrics for our investments in mortgage loans; and 
                
    the use of an income-simulation model that projects net interest income over a range of potential interest-rate scenarios, including parallel interest-rate shocks, nonparallel interest-rate shocks, and nonlinear changes to our funding curve and LIBOR. 
       
  We maintain limits and management action triggers in connection with each of the foregoing metrics. Those limits, management action triggers, and the foregoing market and interest-rate risk metrics are more fully discussed under Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Measurement of Market and Interest-Rate Risk and Related Policy Constraints in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  The following table sets forth each of the foregoing metrics together with any targets, associated limits and management actions triggers at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

Value at Risk.   The table below presents the historical simulation VaR estimate as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , and represents the estimates of potential reduction to our MVE from potential future changes in interest rates and other market factors. Estimated potential market value loss exposures are expressed as a percentage of the current MVE and are based on the historical relative behavior of interest rates and other market factors over a 120-business-day time horizon. 
  
   77 

     Table of Contents  

_______________________ 
           (1) 
    To be consistent with FHFA guidance, we have excluded VaR stress scenarios prior to 1992 because market-risk stress conditions are effectively captured in those scenarios beginning in 1992 and therefore properly present our current VaR exposure. 
              (2) 
    Loss exposure is expressed as a percentage of base MVE. 
       
  Certain Market and Interest-Rate Risk Metrics under Potential Interest-Rate Scenarios 
    
  We also monitor the sensitivities of MVE and the duration of equity to potential interest-rate scenarios. The following table presents certain market and interest-rate risk metrics under different interest-rate scenarios (dollars in millions). 

____________________________ 
           (1) 
    Given the current environment of low interest rates, downward rate shocks are floored as they approach zero, and therefore may not be fully representative of the indicated rate shock. 
              (2) 
    The income simulation metric for   September 30, 2016  , is based on projections of adjusted net income over a range of potential interest-rate scenarios over the following 12-month horizon divided by regulatory capital. Regulatory capital is capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) plus total retained earnings, and projections of adjusted net income exclude a) interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock; b) projected prepayment penalties; c) loss on early extinguishment of debt; or d) changes in fair values from trading securities and hedging activities.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of controls and procedures. 
    
  We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, with the participation of the president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We describe our private-label MBS litigation in Item 3   Legal Proceedings in the 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Subsequent to the quarter covered by this report, we settled certain of our private-label MBS claims with certain defendants for an aggregate amount of   $19.6 million  , which amount is net of legal fees and expenses. 
  
   79 

     Table of Contents  

We continue our private-label MBS litigation against the following entities and/or their affiliates and subsidiaries and/or entities under their control or controlled by affiliates or subsidiaries thereof: Credit Suisse (USA), Inc.; Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc.; Morgan Stanley; Nomura Holding America, Inc.; RBS Holdings USA Inc.; and UBS Americas Inc.  
    
  As reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (filed with the SEC on May 6, 2016), on May 2, 2016, the First Circuit for the United States Court of Appeals (the First Circuit) ruled favorably on our appeal of the dismissal of our claims against Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Moody s Corporation (together Moody s). The First Circuit vacated the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the District Court), which had ruled that federal law does not permit the transfer of cases from one federal court to another where the first court is found to lack personal jurisdiction. The First Circuit remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether transfer of our claims to the Southern District of New York would be in the interest of justice, and such determination is pending. On August 1, 2016, Moody's filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States (the Supreme Court), asking the Supreme Court to review the First Circuit s decision. On October 11, 2016, the Supreme Court denied Moody s petition. 
    
  From time to time, we are subject to various pending legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, we do not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the information presented in this report, readers should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the 2015 Annual Report, which could materially impact our business, financial condition, or future results. These risks are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially impact us.

MPF        CONSOLIDATED INTERBANK AGREEMENT 
    
  This MPF Consolidated Interbank Agreement is entered into this 22   nd    day of July, 2016, (the    Effective Date   ) by and among each of the Federal Home Loan Banks that execute this Agreement (each an    MPF Bank    and collectively the    MPF Banks   ) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in its capacity as the    MPF Provider   .  Each of the MPF Banks and the MPF Provider shall hereinafter be referred to as a    Party    and collectively the    Parties   . 
    
  RECITALS 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Program is a program under which MPF Banks purchase residential mortgage loans originated pursuant to the requirements of the Guides from PFIs; 
    
  WHEREAS, each MPF Bank has entered into a separate Services Agreement, with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, in its capacity as the MPF Provider;   
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks entered among themselves and with the MPF Provider into a Liquidity Option and Master Participation Agreement; 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks also entered among themselves and with the MPF Provider into Servicing Transfer Agreements; 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks desire to continue their participation in the MPF Program and to consolidate the MPF Agreements into this Agreement, to amend the provisions of the MPF Agreements in part and to transfer certain provisions of the MPF Agreements relating to operating and support procedures to the FHLB Guide, with the intention that this Agreement and the FHLB Guide supersede the MPF Agreements; and 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks intend that each Federal Home Loan Bank that desires to participate in the MPF Program become a Party to this Agreement. 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual promises and agreements herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows: 
    
  ARTICLE I. DEFINITIONS 
    
  Section 1.1      Certain Definitions  .  
    
  All capitalized terms used in this Agreement, which includes the recitals, shall have the meanings set forth in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide or in the Guides or as defined in this Agreement. In case of any conflict as to the meaning of a capitalized term, the definition in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide shall control. 
    
  ARTICLE II. FHLB PARTICIPATION IN THE MPF PROGRAM 
    
  Section 2.1.      Participation in the MPF Program  .  

Each Federal Home Loan Bank that executes this Agreement hereby agrees to participate in the MPF Program as an MPF Bank and to offer, at its election, Program Loan products to its PFIs under the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 2.2.      Applicability of Agreement  . 
    
  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide shall apply to all prior, existing and future Program Loans, Master Commitments, Delivery Commitments, participation rights and obligations and any Servicing transfer rights and obligations unless specified otherwise. 
    
  Section 2.3.      FHLB Guide  . 
    
  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the terms of the FHLB Guide, as amended, restated, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time as specified in the FHLB Guide, are incorporated herein by reference and are made an integral part of this Agreement. 
    
  (a)      Amendments or Supplements  . The FHLB Guide may be amended or supplemented from time to time as follows: 
    
  (1)   Non-Substantive Revisions  .  Prior to issuing any non-Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, the MPF Provider will consult with the Active MPF Banks after distributing a draft of the proposed non-Substantive Revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review. The MPF Provider will use commercially reasonable best efforts to balance differences of opinions among the Active MPF Banks, taking into account the direction or purpose of the overall MPF Program as established by the MPF Governance Committee, and abide by any additional obligation of the MPF Provider in determining whether and how to incorporate or address any comments from the Active MPF Banks concerning any non-Substantive Revisions.  Upon receipt of any draft non-Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, the Active MPF Bank must respond within fifteen (15) Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft revisions, or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing; provided, however, that non-Substantive Revisions which must be made to the FHLB Guide to comply with FHFA rules or regulations, third-party investors requirements, Applicable Law, or external matters beyond the control of the MPF Provider, may have a shorter review period, if needed to achieve compliance, but not less than two (2) Business Days (and, for the avoidance of doubt the MPF Provider shall be permitted to make any such revision notwithstanding whether the consent of the Active MPF Banks is obtained). An Active MPF Bank s review of draft FHLB Guide non-Substantive Revisions and opportunity to comment will be considered completed if there is no response from the Active MPF Bank within the time period specified herein, in the transmittal or otherwise specified in writing by the MPF Provider.  The MPF Provider may elect to publish the non-Substantive Revisions without additional review by the Active MPF Banks or, if the MPF Provider deems it appropriate, to provide the MPF Banks an additional review period.  Any comments sent by any MPF Bank after publication of any revisions to the FHLB Guide will be logged in by the MPF Provider and considered for inclusion when future revisions are made to the FHLB Guide. If an Active MPF Bank determines the proposed revision should be classified as a Substantive Revision, that Active MPF Bank must object to the non-Substantive Revision classification within two (2) Business Days from receipt of the proposed revision. The MPF Provider shall then (i) request the Active MPF Banks to review the proposed revision as a Substantive Revision pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(2) or (ii) refer the proposed revision to the MPF Governance Committee for further action. If the MPF Provider elects a Substantive Revision review, two (2) Business Days will be deducted from the review time provided in Section 2.3(a)(2). 

(2)   Substantive Revisions  . Except for FHLB Guide revisions subject to Section 2.3(a)(3), Substantive Revisions may be made only with the approval of a super majority of the Active MPF Banks, which is defined as 66% of the Active MPF Banks (rounded up to the nearest whole number), (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) after distributing a draft of the proposed Substantive Revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review.  Upon receipt of any draft Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, each Active MPF Bank must respond within ten (10) Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft Substantive Revisions or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing. The MPF Provider shall be permitted to make any changes which must be made to the FHLB Guide to comply with FHFA rules or regulations, third-party investors requirements, Applicable Law, or external matters beyond the control of the MPF Provider without the majority approval of the Active MPF Banks; however, the MPF Provider shall circulate such revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review as provided for non-Substantive Revisions. No response or no substantive objection by an Active MPF Bank to a proposed Substantive Revision within the timeframe specified shall be considered an approval by such Active MPF Bank of the proposed Substantive Revision. In the event that circulation of additional draft Substantive Revisions are necessary, each Active MPF Bank shall respond within five (5) Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft Substantive Revisions or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing.  For the avoidance of doubt, any proposed revision to an Appendix to the FHLB Guide, including without limitation, to any forms or the Supplemental Information, shall be deemed a non-Substantive Revision.  
    
  (3)   Revisions to MPF Membership Fee and Transaction Services Fee  . Any FHLB Guide revisions related to the MPF Membership Fee or the Transaction Services Fee specified in ARTICLE IX will be decided by the MPF Governance Committee. 
    
  (b)      Applicability of Amendments and Supplements  . Unless otherwise specified, all amendments and supplements to the FHLB Guide shall apply to all existing Program Loans, Participation Interests, Master Commitments and Delivery Commitments.   
    
  ARTICLE III.  MPF PROVIDER RESPONSIBILITIES 
    
  Section 3.1.      Services of the MPF Master Servicer  . 
    
  (a)    The MPF Provider shall act as the Master Servicer for each MPF Bank with respect to all Program Loans funded or purchased by the MPF Bank pursuant to the MPF Program.

  (b)    As part of its master servicing duties hereunder, the MPF Provider, for the benefit of each MPF Bank, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the obligations of the MPF Master Servicer under the Master Servicing Agreement in the same manner as the MPF Provider would act if the MPF Provider were the owner of the related Program Loans.  Notwithstanding the MPF Provider s delegation of master servicing obligations to the MPF Master Servicer pursuant to the Master Servicing Agreement, the MPF Provider shall not be relieved from its master servicing obligations hereunder, and the MPF Provider shall remain obligated and primarily liable to the MPF Bank for the master servicing of the Program Loans in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the MPF Provider s liability  

arising from or related to its master servicing obligations under this Section 3.1 shall be limited solely to liability resulting from the MPF Provider s or MPF Master Servicer s negligence or willful misconduct.

  (a)      Election of Service  .  Each MPF Bank may elect, as part of the master servicing duties, that the MPF Provider administer Approved Non-Member Servicers on behalf of the MPF Bank in accordance with this Section 3.2 and as specified in the FHLB Guide.

  (b)      Administration of Approved Non-Member Servicers  .  The Parties agree that the MPF Provider shall administer Approved Non-Member Servicers on behalf of and for the benefit of the MPF Banks in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide.   
    
  (c)      Exercise of Administrative Authority  .  The MPF Provider agrees to exercise the authority granted to it under this Agreement and in the FHLB Guide to administer Approved Non-Member Servicers with appropriate consultation with the MPF Banks that own the affected Program Loans in accordance with the FHLB Guide, in the same manner and with the same care that the MPF Provider would exercise if it owned the assets.  The MPF Provider will enforce the Servicing Agreements for the benefit of the MPF Banks that own the Program Loans that are serviced by the Approved Non-Member Servicers.  
    
  (d)      Costs of Enforcement  . Any and all liabilities, costs, expenses and disbursements (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal expenses) under this Section 3.2 incurred by any of the Parties in any effort to collect any amounts payable hereunder by another Party, shall be paid by the defaulting Party upon demand of the collecting Party whether or not suit is filed, together with interest thereon from the date due until paid at the MPF Bank Default Rate.   
    
  Section 3.3.      Loan Funding and Reporting Systems  .   
    
  The Parties agree that the MPF Provider shall maintain Program Loan purchase funding and reporting systems for use by the MPF Banks as specified in the FHLB Guide.

  The Parties agree that changes and enhancements to the MPF Systems and Customized Enhancements shall be implemented as specified in the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 3.6      Quality Control and Loss Mitigation  . 
    
  The MPF Provider will perform the same level of quality control review and loss mitigation oversight for the Program Loans acquired from the MPF Bank s PFIs as the MPF Provider would perform if they were  

its own Program Loans as provided in the FHLB Guide. The Parties agree that quality control reviews for Program Loans shall be in accordance with the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 3.7.      Financial Reporting and Controls  . 
    
  The MPF Provider shall provide such reports on its financial reporting and controls as specified in the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 3.8.      Support of MPF Bank PFIs  .  
    
  The MPF Provider shall be responsible for providing the Operational Matters support to all MPF Banks  PFIs by establishing an MPF Service Center. The MPF Provider shall ensure that the MPF Service Center is adequately staffed to service the MPF Bank PFIs in a commercially reasonable manner and with no less service than the MPF Provider would have provided if they were its own PFIs. The MPF Service Center operations shall be as described in the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 3.9.      Services of the Custodian  . 
    
  The MPF Provider shall act as the custodian for the MPF Bank with respect to all Program Loans funded or purchased by the MPF Bank pursuant to the MPF Program.  The MPF Provider may discharge this custodian duty with the authority and rights provided to it and subject to the requirements specified in the FHLB Guide.  The MPF Provider s authority and rights shall include its ability to delegate, to one or more entities, its duties and obligations as custodian under the MPF Program.  The MPF Provider shall have direct and primary responsibility to the MPF Bank for the performance of the duties of the Master Custodian under the Master Custodian Agreement. 
    
  Section 3.10.      Service Level Commitments  .  
    
  The MPF Provider agrees that it shall perform the services specified in this Agreement in accordance with the service levels set forth in the FHLB Guide. 
    
  ARTICLE IV. MPF BANK RESPONSIBILITIES 
    
  Section 4.1.      Administration of the MPF Program  .   
    
  Each MPF Bank agrees to administer its PFI Agreements in accordance with their terms, including the Guides, the FHLB Guide and all other incorporated documents.  Each MPF Bank acknowledges that the MPF Provider and other MPF Banks have an interest in consistent implementation of the MPF Program, and as the drafter of the documents related to the MPF Program, the MPF Provider can provide an authoritative interpretation of such documents in the event of conflict with a PFI over their meaning. The obligations of each MPF Bank under this Section 4.1 shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
    
  Section 4.2.      Management of Assets  .  
    
  The PFIs that elect to service Program Loans are obligated under the terms of the PFI Agreements to perform all customary Servicing functions, including loss mitigation and property disposition, with respect to the Program Loans.  Each MPF Bank shall have the responsibility for exercising commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the terms of the PFI Agreement and its PFIs  compliance with the Guides, on behalf of itself, the MPF Provider and such other parties identified in the FHLB Guide.  

Section 4.3.      Eligibility and Creditworthiness of PFIs  . 
    
  Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, the approval of PFIs shall be as set forth in the FHLB Guide. Each MPF Bank shall be responsible for evaluating the eligibility, including the creditworthiness, of each of its PFIs for participation under the MPF Program for both Bank Program Loans and Provider Program Loans. However, any MPF Bank that has acquired or acquires a participation in Bank Program Loans or acquires Program Loans from MPF Bank PFIs shall be responsible for its own credit decision with respect to its investment in such assets. Consistent with applicable law and regulation and as provided in the FHLB Guide, each MPF Bank shall promptly provide notice to the MPF Provider of any material adverse change in the financial condition of any such MPF Bank s PFIs of which it becomes aware and that such MPF Bank reasonably believes could result in the PFI s breach of the PFI Agreement.  
    
  Section 4.4.      Relationship of the Parties; Restrictions on Transfers  . 
    
  (a)    Each MPF Bank will receive and hold all receipts and collections with respect to the Program Loans funded through or purchased from such MPF Bank s PFIs, for the benefit of itself and any other Participants, in accordance with their respective interests in the Program Loans.  Except to the extent of its obligations under Section 3.9, the MPF Provider shall have no fiduciary duty to any MPF Bank.  Except to the extent of its obligations under Section 13.4 of this Agreement, each MPF Bank shall have no fiduciary duty to the MPF Provider.   
    
  (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each MPF Bank agrees that it will not sell or transfer any of its interests in Program Loans or its rights under this Agreement, or any portion thereof, except (i) to another FHLB or member or housing associate of an FHLB, (ii) to an institutional third party investor approved of in writing by the MPF Provider, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed or (iii) to the PFIs providing the credit enhancement for such Program Loans; provided, however, that servicing must be provided by a PFI or an MPF Program approved Servicer, and unless such covenants and obligations have been assigned to another MPF Bank or other approved investor in such Program Loans, such MPF Bank shall continue to monitor the creditworthiness of its PFIs and, when appropriate to protect the interests of the holders of the Program Loans, obtain a perfected security interest in collateral to secure any of its PFIs  obligations under their respective PFI Agreements.  The MPF Provider will continue to provide MPF Product specific reports. 
    
  Section 4.5.      Loan Loss Reserves  .  
    
  Each MPF Bank shall maintain its own respective loan loss reserves with respect to the Program Loans. 
    
  Section 4.6.      Extent of MPF Bank Responsibilities  .  
    
  Unless specified otherwise, each MPF Bank s responsibilities under this ARTICLE IV are only to the MPF Provider and not to any other MPF Bank.  
    
  ARTICLE V. PROGRAM LOAN FUNDING AND PRICING 
    
  Section 5.1.      Execution of Master Commitments  . 

Each MPF Bank agrees to enter into each Master Commitment in accordance with the requirements of the FHLB Guide.  
    
  Section 5.2.      Pricing  . 
    
  (a)      Pricing of Program Loans  .  Each MPF Bank may use the Pricing Process as published by the MPF Provider in the FHLB Guide for setting the prices of the Program Loans which such MPF Bank acquires under the MPF Program or which its PFIs sell under any Additional Product on any Business Day.  As long as the Pricing Process provides for the MPF Provider to publish suggested base prices for Bank Program Loans, (a) the MPF Provider will utilize a specified pricing methodology and assumptions approved by the MPF Governance Committee to determine such suggested base prices and (b) an MPF Bank will be deemed to have adopted such suggested base prices if such MPF Bank makes no adjustments to the suggested base prices during the period specified in the FHLB Guide.  
    
  (1) Under the Pricing Process, each MPF Bank shall be responsible for, and the following shall be deemed to be in the control of each MPF Bank:  
    
  (i)  setting its own prices for Delivery Commitments whether by adjustment to or adoption of suggested base prices;  
           (ii)  adopting a suggested base price as such MPF Bank s price;  
                       (iii)  the accuracy of data input by such MPF Bank;  
                       (iv)  any errors or omissions by such MPF Bank in inputting data; and  
                        (v)  such MPF Bank s use of the Pricing Process.   
    
  (2)  Under the Pricing Process, the MPF Provider shall be responsible for, and the following shall be deemed to be in the control of the MPF Provider: 
    
             (i)  employing the prices set by each MPF Bank for the indicative prices it posts to the eMPF website in accordance with the FHLB Guide;  
  (ii)  employing the prices set by each MPF Bank in the issuance of Delivery Commitments under such MPF Bank s Master Commitments; and 
  (iii) publishing pricing for Provider Program Loans in accordance with the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 5.3.      Delivery Commitments  . 
    
  (a)    As provided in the Guides, the MPF Service Center will publish Rate and Fee Schedules for each MPF Bank s PFIs employing the prices set by such MPF Bank. Rate and Fee Schedules are subject to change as provided for in the Guides. Delivery Commitments will be managed as specified in the Guides and the FHLB Guide.   
    
  Section 5.4.      Alternative Pricing by MPF Bank and Related Delivery Commitments  . 
    
  (a)      Election of Alternative Pricing by MPF Bank  .  Each MPF Bank may elect to create MPF Bank Base Price Schedules in accordance with the applicable provisions in the FHLB Guide.  An MPF Bank shall indicate its election to create MPF Bank Base Price Schedules by executing the election form specified in the FHLB Guide (and delivering such form to the MPF Provider) and upon such election such MPF Bank agrees to be subject to the alternative pricing provisions specified in the FHLB Guide and such MPF Bank commits to utilizing its MPF Bank Base Price Schedules on a daily basis and as a regular course of business except for emergencies or as otherwise agreed to by the MPF Provider and such MPF Bank. 

Section 5.5.      Transactional Relationships  .  
    
  (a)      Maintenance of Accounts at the MPF Provider  .  Each MPF Bank will establish and maintain a Clearing Account with the MPF Provider. 
    
  (b)      Funding of Payment Obligations  . The MPF Provider hereby consents to each MPF Bank withdrawing funds from such MPF Bank s Clearing Account from time to time to satisfy the MPF Provider s payment obligations under this Agreement. Each MPF Bank hereby consents to the MPF Provider withdrawing funds from such MPF Bank s Clearing Account from time to time to satisfy the MPF Bank s obligations to pay any fees and any other payment obligation under this Agreement. 
    
  (c)      Interest on Clearing Account  . In accordance with the Master Transactions Agreement between the MPF Provider and each MPF Bank, the MPF Provider will credit to each MPF Bank s Clearing Account interest on the outstanding balance thereof from time to time in accordance with the Master Transactions Agreement at the MPF Bank Rate.  In the event that any withdrawal from an MPF Bank s Clearing Account shall cause the balance in such account to become negative, such deficit shall be deemed a loan from the MPF Provider to such MPF Bank, payable upon demand and bearing interest at the MPF Bank Default Rate as defined in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide.  
    
  ARTICLE VI. SERVICING TRANSFERS BETWEEN PFIS OF DIFFERENT MPF BANKS 
    
  Section 6.1.      Transfers of Servicing  . 
    
  (a)    The Parties hereby agree that any voluntary or involuntary transfers of Subject Servicing (i) between a PFI of an MPF Bank to a PFI of a different MPF Bank, (ii) from any Person acting as a receiver, trustee or conservator (or similar function) of a PFI of an MPF Bank to a PFI of a different MPF Bank, or (iii) from an MPF Bank to a PFI of a different MPF Bank, shall all be generally in accordance with this Agreement and specifically in accordance with this ARTICLE VI and the related provisions of the FHLB Guide. 
    
  (b)      Consent to Transfers of Servicing  . The Parties agree to consent to any voluntary or involuntary transfer of Subject Servicing in accordance with the requirements specified in the FHLB Guide.

     (i)    For MPF Program products with a First Loss Account based on a percentage of each Program Loan acquired under a Master Commitment, such as MPF 100, MPF 125 and MPF Plus, the Realized Losses arising from all the Program Loans acquired under the Master Commitment shall be paid from the following sources: 

(A) first from any Reported Gain available for the Master Commitment; 
    
  (B) second from the Participants  First Loss Accounts on a Pro Rata Basis until all First Loss Accounts are exhausted;

For example, if a Master Commitment had a total First Loss Account of $100,000 (accrued through the Loss Allocation Date for a Realized Loss), and the Participant Bank s FLA was $25,000 and the Lead Bank s First Loss Account was $75,000, then the Participant Bank would pay 25% of the Residual Realized Loss and the Lead Bank would pay 75% of the Residual Realized Loss.

For avoidance of any doubt, written notice of termination shall only terminate this Agreement as between the MPF Bank providing such notice and all other existing Parties to this Agreement, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect among all such other existing Parties. If the MPF Provider provides written notice of termination to an MPF Bank, the written notice of termination shall only terminate this Agreement as between such MPF Bank and all other existing Parties to this Agreement, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect among all such other existing Parties.  
    
  (b)    Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement by any Party for any reason, the obligations of the terminating Party, the MPF Provider and any other Party thereby affected by the termination shall continue with respect to all Program Loans funded or purchased under this Agreement pursuant to Delivery Commitments issued prior to such termination, including, without limitation, the MPF Provider shall provide the services for each Program Loan acquired by an MPF Bank, and such MPF Bank shall pay the applicable Transaction Services Fees, continuously from the date of such termination until the earliest of: 
    
  (1) the Program Loan's principal and interest have been paid in full in accordance with the requirements of the PFI Agreement; or 
    
  (2) the Program Loan has been foreclosed or liquidated, the security property therefor properly disposed of, and the claim settled with the PFI;  
    
  (3) an MPF Bank sells its Program Loans to another MPF Bank; or 
    
  (4) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FHLB Guide, the MPF Provider s obligations are (i) transferred to a third party by agreement of such MPF Bank and the MPF Provider, (ii) transferred to a third party on written direction of the FHFA or (iii) with the consent of the MPF Provider, assumed by such MPF Bank. 
    
  (c)    Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, each MPF Bank agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly return to the MPF Provider all marketing and operational materials previously provided by the MPF Provider, and no longer needed by such MPF Bank to fulfill its remaining obligations hereunder, unless other mutually acceptable arrangements have been made.  
    
  Section 13.2.      Events of Default  .   
    
  It shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement if any Party, with respect to another Party, fails to perform its obligations or breaches any of its covenants under this Agreement and such failure to perform or breach is not cured (i) within sixty (60) days from the date the non-breaching party gives written notice  

of such default, if the default is capable of being cured within such time limit, or (ii) within a reasonable time after notice if the cure is commenced within the sixty (60) day period and diligently pursued thereafter.

  (b)      Remedies for the MPF Provider s Default  . Without limiting the effect of Section 12.2, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by the MPF Provider, each MPF Bank shall have the right, subject to the requirements of Section 13.1(b), to terminate this Agreement with respect to such MPF Bank. Until the MPF Provider s obligations to provide the Services terminates as provided in Section 13.1(b), such MPF Bank shall continue to pay the Transaction Services Fee for the Services after a termination in accordance with the provisions of the FHLB Guide at the time of such termination. Further, the MPF Provider shall pay to such MPF Bank an amount equal to the MPF Bank s actual and direct damages arising from the Event of Default, but the MPF Provider shall have no responsibility for any consequential or punitive damages.

  (c)    Each MPF Bank agrees to obtain a perfected security interest in collateral for the benefit of itself and any Participants and/or Owner Banks, except when prohibited by law, as the MPF Bank reasonably determines may be necessary to secure the obligations of the MPF Bank s PFIs under their respective PFI Agreements or any other credit agreement, securing each PFI s obligations under its PFI Agreement. 
    
  (d)    Without limiting the rights of the MPF Provider and any other MPF Bank under this Agreement and the FHLB Guide, the MPF Provider shall not have an interest in any (i) other property taken as security for any other credit, loan or financial accommodation made or furnished to any PFI by any MPF Bank in which the Participant has no participation interest; (ii) property now or hereafter in the MPF Bank s possession or under the MPF Bank s control other than by reason of any PFI Agreement; or (iii) deposits or other indebtedness which may be or might become security for performance or payment of any obligations and  

liabilities of any PFI under the PFI Agreement by reason of the general description contained in any instrument other than the PFI Agreement held by such MPF Bank or by reason of any right of setoff, counterclaim, banker s lien or otherwise.   
    
  Section 13.5      Survival  .  
    
  Without limiting any other express survival provisions contained in this Agreement, all representations and warranties and the indemnifications contained in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are attached to the same document.  Delivery of a signature page to, or an executed counterpart of, this Agreement (or any amendment, waiver, consent or supplement related hereto) by facsimile, email transmission of a scanned image, or other electronic means, shall be effective as delivery of an originally executed counterpart. 
    
  Section 14.6.      Governing Law  . 
    
  This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the statutory and common law of the United States of America.

  Section 14.7.      Severability of Provisions  . 
    
  Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  Subject to the terms of Section 4.4, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the MPF Provider and each MPF Bank and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Although the provisions of this Agreement may benefit Persons that are not Parties including, without limitation, PFIs, Members, Servicers or other Persons engaged in the MPF Program, none of them is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and they shall have no rights under this Agreement.

  No delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by one Party of any right, power or remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  No amendment to, modification or waiver of, or consent with respect to, any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and executed and delivered by the Party against whom enforcement of such amendment, modification, waiver, or consent is sought. 
    
  Section 14.10.      References to Sections, Exhibits and Agreement; Captions  .

Article and Section captions used in this Agreement are for convenience only, and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement. 

Section 14.11.      Specific Performance  .  
    
  The Parties hereto recognize and agree that it may be impossible to measure in money the damages which will accrue to any Party hereto or its successors or assigns by reason of a failure to perform any of the obligations arising under this Agreement.  Therefore, if a Party or its successors or assigns shall institute any action or proceeding to enforce any provision hereof, any Party against whom such action or proceeding is brought hereby agrees that specific performance may be sought and obtained for any breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual damages. 
    
  Section 14.12.      Mediation of Disputes; Jurisdiction and Venue  .  
    
  (a)    No Party shall institute a proceeding before any tribunal to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (a    Dispute   ), before such Party has sought to resolve the dispute through mediation.  If the applicable Parties do not promptly agree on a mediator, any such Party may request the Director of the FHFA to appoint a mediator.  All mediation proceedings under this Agreement shall be held in Washington, D.C. or such other location as the applicable Parties may agree upon.  If the mediator is unable to facilitate a settlement of the Dispute within a reasonable time, as determined by the mediator, the mediator shall issue a written statement to the applicable Parties to that effect and the complaining Party may then pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity.  The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be paid by the Party initiating mediation, unless the applicable Parties agree otherwise, but the paying Party shall be entitled to a judgment for reimbursement of such fees and expenses if it prevails against any other Party on all material issues in a judicial proceeding. 
    
  (b)    Each Party consents to the exercise of jurisdiction over its person and its property by any court of competent jurisdiction situated in the City of Chicago, State of Illinois (whether it be a court of the State of Illinois or a court of the United States of America situated in Illinois) for the enforcement of this Agreement or in any other controversy, dispute or question arising hereunder, and such Party waives any and all personal or other rights to object to such jurisdiction for such purposes.  Each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such court; provided, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed to preclude any other appropriate forum.  If such litigation is commenced at any time, the applicable Parties agree that service of process may be made, and personal jurisdiction over the other Party obtained, by service of a copy of the summons, complaint and other pleadings required to commence such litigation by United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such Party at its address for notices as provided in this Agreement.  The applicable Parties waive all claims of lack of effectiveness or error by reason of any such service. 
    
  Section 14.13.      No Joint and Several Liability; Necessary Parties  . 
    
  No Party to this Agreement shall be jointly and severally liable for any breach of any other Party under this Agreement. No Party to this Agreement shall be deemed a necessary party to any proceeding or litigation simply by reason of being a Party of this Agreement. The Parties agree that in the event of any dispute or disagreement among Parties relating to this Agreement that require any type of proceeding or litigation to resolve the dispute or disagreement, only the Parties among whom such dispute has arisen shall be made a party to any proceeding or litigation. 
    
  Section 14.14.      Amendment and Restatement 

This Agreement amends, restates, replaces and supersedes in their entirety the MPF Agreements.  Each Party to this Agreement (a) agrees that all references to the MPF Agreements that are included in any other agreement or other document executed or delivered by any Party in connection with the MPF Program shall be deemed to be references to this Agreement, as amended from time to time, and (b) hereby amends all such MPF Agreements and other documents to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect such changed references.   
    
  Section 14.15.      Equal Treatment of MPF Banks  .  
    
  The MPF Program is a cooperative program among the MPF Banks and the MPF Provider.  Consequently, the MPF Provider and each MPF Bank agree that any amendment or modification to this Agreement offered by or to any Active MPF Bank shall be promptly offered to all other Active MPF Banks.
