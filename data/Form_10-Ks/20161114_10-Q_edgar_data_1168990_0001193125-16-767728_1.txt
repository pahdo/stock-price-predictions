1.  
  Nature of operations        Organization and Business   
 Superfund Green, L.P. (the  Fund ), a Delaware limited partnership, commenced operations on November 5, 2002. The Fund was organized to trade
speculatively in the United States ( U.S. ) and international commodity futures and forward markets using a fully-automated computerized trading system. The Fund has issued two classes of units ( Units ), Series A and
Series B (each, a  Series ). The two Series are traded and managed the same way except for the degree of leverage.    The terms of Series A
and Series B each shall continue until December 31, 2050, unless the applicable Series is terminated earlier by the Fund s general partner, Superfund Capital Management, Inc. ( Superfund Capital Management ) or by operation of
law or a decline in the aggregate net assets of such Series to less than $500,000.      

2.  
  Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies        Basis of Presentation   
 The unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) with respect to the Form 10-Q and reflect all adjustments which in the opinion of management are normal and recurring, and which are necessary for a fair statement of
the results of interim periods presented. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in the Fund s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.     Valuation of Investments in Futures Contracts and Forward Contracts   
 All commodity interests (including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments) are used for trading purposes. The commodity
interests are recorded on a trade date basis and open contracts are recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities at fair value on the last business day of the period, which represents market value for those commodity interests for which
market quotes are readily available.    Exchange-traded futures contracts are valued at settlement prices published by the recognized exchange. Any spot and
forward foreign currency contracts held by the Fund will be valued at published settlement prices or at dealers  quotes.     Translation of Foreign
Currency     Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts at the period-end exchange rates. Purchases
and sales of investments and income and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts on the transaction date. Adjustments arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the statements of
operations.    The Fund does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on
investments from fluctuations from changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments in the statements of operations.  
      21  

Table of Contents  

   Investment Transactions, Investment Income and Expenses   
 Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Interest income and expenses are recognized on the accrual basis. Operating expenses of the
Fund are allocated to each Series in proportion to the net asset value of the Series at the beginning of each month. Expenses directly attributable to a particular Series are charged directly to that Series.  
 Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains and losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and
market price) are reported in the statements of operations as a net gain or loss, as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) 210-20,  Offsetting   Balance Sheet .    Set forth herein are instruments and transactions eligible for offset in
the statements of assets and liabilities and which are subject to derivative clearing agreements with the Fund s futures commission merchants. Each futures commission merchant nets margin held on behalf of each Series of the Fund or payment
obligations of the futures commission merchant to each Series against any payment obligations of that Series to the futures commission merchant. Each Series is required to deposit margin at each futures commission merchant to meet the original and
maintenance requirements established by that futures commission merchant, and/or the exchange or clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the instrument is traded. The derivative clearing agreements give each futures commission merchant a
security interest in this margin to secure any liabilities owed to the futures commission merchant arising from a default by the Series. As of September 30, 2016, the Fund had on deposit $2,205,239 at ADM Investor Services, Inc. and $4,183,343
at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Inc. As of September 30, 2016, Series A had on deposit $919,418 at ADM Investor Services, Inc. and $1,669,451 at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Inc. As of September 30,
2016, Series B had on deposit $1,285,821 at ADM Investor Services, Inc. and $2,513,892 at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Inc.     Income
Taxes     The Fund does not record a provision for U.S. income taxes because the partners report their share of the Fund s income or loss on their
returns. The financial statements reflect the Fund s transactions without adjustment, if any, required for income tax purposes.    Superfund Capital
Management has evaluated the application of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), to the Fund, to determine whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. Based on this evaluation,
Superfund Capital Management has determined no reserves for uncertain tax positions are required to be recorded as a result of the application of ASC 740. Superfund Capital Management is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably
possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next twelve months. As a result, no income tax liability or expense has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements. The Fund files federal and
various state tax returns. The 2013 through 2015 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.  
  Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Superfund Capital Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Recently Adopted and/or Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
  ASU 2015-14     In August 2015, FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
( ASU 2014-09 ). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 affect any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the
scope of other standards. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Superfund Capital Management is evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-14 on the financial statements and disclosures.

3.  
  Fair Value Measurements       The Fund follows ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:      

Level 1: 
   
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;  

Level 2: 
   
 Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;  

Level 3: 
   
 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.  
   A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.     Derivative Contracts.  Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or over-the-counter
( OTC ). Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed to be actively traded or not. The Fund has exposure to exchange-traded derivative
contracts through the Fund s trading of exchange-traded futures contracts. The Fund s exchange-traded futures contract positions are valued daily at settlement prices published by the applicable exchanges. In such cases, provided they are
deemed to be actively traded, exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Less actively traded exchange-traded derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
 OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration
to market-clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the
contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards and swaps, model inputs can generally
be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. The OTC derivatives held by the Fund may include forwards and swaps. Spot and forward foreign currency contracts held by the Fund are valued at published daily
settlement prices or at dealers  quotes. The Fund s forward positions are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
 Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently
more difficult. Such instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Where the Fund does not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions,
transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price. The valuations of
these less liquid OTC derivatives are typically based on Level 1 and/or Level 2 inputs that can be observed in the market, as well as unobservable Level 3 inputs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Fund updates the Level 1
and Level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes, with resulting gains and losses reflected within Level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing
services and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. In circumstances in which the Fund cannot verify the model value to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially
different estimate of fair value. The Fund attempts to avoid holding less liquid OTC derivatives. However, once held, the market for any particular derivative contract could become less liquid during the holding period. There were no Level 3
holdings at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 or during the periods then ended.

  Disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities       The Fund follows ASC 815,  Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  ( ASC 815 ). ASC 815 is intended to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity
uses derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect an entity s results of operations and financial position.  
 Derivative instruments held by the Fund do not qualify as derivative instruments held as hedging instruments, as defined in ASC 815. Instead, the Fund
includes derivative instruments in its trading activity. Per the requirements of ASC 815, the Fund discloses the gains and losses on its trading activities for both derivative and nonderivative instruments in the statements of operations.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  The Fund engages in the speculative trading of forward contracts in currency and futures contracts in a wide
range of commodities, including equity markets, interest rates, food and fiber, energy, livestock, and metals. ASC 815 requires entities to recognize all derivatives instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the statement of
financial position. Investments in forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are recorded in the statements of assets and liabilities as unrealized appreciation or depreciation on open forward contracts and futures contracts purchased and
futures contracts sold. Since the derivatives held or sold by the Fund are for speculative trading purposes, the derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of ASC 815. Accordingly, all realized gains and
losses, as well as any change in net unrealized gains or losses on open positions from the preceding period, are recognized as part of the Fund s realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments in the statements of operations.  
 Superfund Capital Management believes futures and forward trading activity expressed as a percentage of net assets is indicative of trading activity.
Information concerning the fair value of the Fund s derivatives held long or sold short, as well as information related to the annual average volume of the Fund s derivative activity, is as follows:

  Due from/to brokers       Due from brokers consists of proceeds from securities sold. Amounts due from
brokers may be restricted to the extent that they serve as deposits for securities sold short. Amounts due to brokers, if any, represent margin borrowings that are collateralized by certain securities. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, there were no amounts due to brokers.    In the normal course of business, all of the Fund s marketable securities
transactions, money balances and marketable security positions are transacted with brokers. The Fund is subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf.

  Allocation of net profits and losses       In accordance with the Fund s Sixth Amended and Restated
Limited Partnership Agreement, net profits and losses of the Fund are allocated to partners according to their respective interests in the Fund as of the beginning of each month.  
 Subscriptions received in advance, if any, represent cash received prior to the balance sheet date for subscriptions of the subsequent month and do not
participate in the earnings of the Fund until the following month.

  Related party transactions       Superfund Capital Management shall be paid a management fee equal to
one-twelfth of 1.85% of month-end net assets (1.85% per annum), ongoing offering expenses equal to one-twelfth of 1% of month-end net assets (1% per annum), not to exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred, and monthly operating expenses equal
to one-twelfth of 0.15% of month-end net assets (0.15% per annum), not to exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred. Superfund Capital Management will also be paid a monthly performance/incentive fee equal to 25% of the new appreciation without
respect to interest income. Trading losses will be carried forward and no further performance/incentive fee may be paid until the prior losses have been recovered. In addition, Superfund Brokerage Services, Inc., an affiliate of Superfund Capital
Management, serves as the introducing broker for the Fund s futures transactions and receives a portion of the brokerage commissions paid by the Fund in connection with its futures trading. Superfund USA, LLC, an entity related to Superfund
Capital Management by common ownership, shall be paid monthly selling commissions equal to one-twelfth of 4% (4% per annum) of the month-end net asset value of the Fund. However, the maximum cumulative selling commission per Unit is limited to 10%
of the initial public offering price of Units sold. Selling commissions charged as of the end of each month in excess of 10% of the initial public offering price of Units sold shall not be paid out to any selling agent but shall instead be held in a
separate account. Accrued monthly performance fees, if any, will then be charged against both net assets of the Fund as of month-end, as well as against amounts held in the separate account. Any increase or decrease in net assets and any accrued
interest will then be credited or charged to each investor (a  Limited Partner ) on a pro rata basis. The remainder of the amounts held in the separate account, if any, shall then be reinvested in Units as of such month-end, at the current
net asset value, for the benefit of the appropriate Limited Partner. The amount of any distribution to a Limited Partner, any amount paid to a Limited Partner on redemption of Units and any redemption fee paid to Superfund Capital Management upon
the redemption of Units will be charged to that Limited Partner. Selling commissions are shown gross on the statements of operations and amounts over the 10% selling commission threshold are rebated to the Limited Partner by purchasing Units of the
Fund.

9.  
  Financial instrument risk       In the normal course of its business, the Fund is party to financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. The term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on
the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. These financial instruments may include forwards, futures and options, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future
commitments to exchange currencies or cash flows, to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specific future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in
cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded instruments are standardized and include futures and certain option contracts. OTC contracts are negotiated
between contracting parties and include forwards and certain options. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk. In general, the risks
associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract.  
 For the Fund, gross unrealized gains and losses related to exchange-traded futures were $657,205 and $553,188, respectively at September 30, 2016. For
the Fund, gross unrealized gains and losses related to exchange-traded futures were $953,099 and $925,717, respectively, at September 30, 2015. For the Fund, gross unrealized gains and losses related to non-exchange traded forwards were $31,250
and $25,255, respectively, at September 30, 2016.

  For Series A, gross unrealized gains and losses related to exchange-traded futures were $245,786 and $220,215,
respectively at September 30, 2016. For Series A, gross unrealized gains and losses related to exchange-traded futures were $381,211 and $371,398, respectively, at September 30, 2015. For Series A, gross unrealized gains and losses related
to non-exchange traded forwards were $9,768 and $6,970, respectively, at September 30, 2016.    For Series B, gross unrealized gains and losses related
to exchange-traded futures were $411,419 and $332,973, respectively at September 30, 2016. For Series B, gross unrealized gains and losses related to exchange-traded futures were $571,888 and $554,319, respectively, at September 30, 2015.
For Series B, gross unrealized gains and losses related to non-exchange traded forwards were $21,482 and $18,285, respectively, at September 30, 2016.  
 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Fund due to market changes, including interest and foreign
exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. In entering into these contracts, there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by conditions such as interest rate volatility, resulting in
such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interest positions at the same time, and Superfund Capital Management was unable to offset such positions, the Fund could experience substantial losses.  
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk with
respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transactions. The Fund s risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is typically limited to the
amounts recognized in the statements of assets and liabilities and not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. As the Fund s assets are held in segregated accounts with futures commission merchants, the Fund has
credit risk and concentration risk. The Fund s futures commission merchants are currently ADM Investor Services, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Inc.  
 Superfund Capital Management monitors and attempts to control the Fund s risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit, and risk management
monitoring systems, and accordingly believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Fund is subject. These monitoring systems allow Superfund Capital Management to statistically analyze
actual trading results with risk adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, on-line monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures and forward positions by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss
transactions, and collateral positions.    The majority of these futures and forwards mature within one year of September 30, 2016. However, due to the
nature of the Fund s business, these instruments may not be held to maturity.      

10.  
  Subscriptions and redemptions       Effective May 1, 2014, the Fund no longer accepts subscriptions.
   A Limited Partner may request any or all of his investment in such Series be redeemed by such Series at the net asset value of a Unit within such Series
as of the end of each month, subject to a minimum redemption of $1,000 and subject further to such Limited Partner having an investment in such Series, after giving effect to the requested redemption, at least equal to the minimum initial investment
amount of $10,000. Limited Partners must transmit a written request of such redemption to Superfund Capital Management not less than five business days prior to the end of the month (or such shorter period as permitted by Superfund Capital
Management) as of which the redemption is to be effective. Redemptions will generally be paid within twenty days after the effective date of the redemption. However, in special circumstances, including, but not limited to, inability to
liquidate dealers  positions as of a redemption date or default or delay in payments due to each Series from clearing brokers, banks or other persons or entities, each Series may in turn delay payment to persons requesting redemption of the
proportionate part of the net assets of each Series represented by the sums that are subject of such default or delay. As provided in the Partnership Agreement, if the net asset value per Unit within a Series as of the end of any business day
declines by 50% or more from either the prior year-end or the prior month-end Unit value of such Series, Superfund Capital Management will suspend trading activities, notify all Limited Partners within such Series of the relevant facts within seven
business days and declare a special redemption period.      
   In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that provide general
indemnifications. The Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made against the Fund, and therefore cannot be established; however, based on experience, the risk of loss from such claims is
considered remote.      
   Superfund Capital Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the
Fund through the date the financial statements were filed and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     
  INTRODUCTION     The Fund commenced the offering of its Units
on October 22, 2002. The initial offering terminated on October 31, 2002 and the Fund commenced operations on November 5, 2002. The continuing offering period commenced at the termination of the initial offering period and ended May 1,
2014. Subscription and redemption data is presented for both the Fund, as the SEC registrant, and for Series A and Series B, individually. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, redemptions totaled $1,154,355 in the Fund. For the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, redemptions totaled $578,251 in Series A and $276,104 in Series B.     LIQUIDITY   
 Most U.S. commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily price fluctuation
limits  or  daily limits.  During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. This may affect the Fund s ability to initiate new positions or close existing ones or may prevent it from having
orders executed. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Fund to
substantial losses, which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Fund may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices if little trading in
such contracts is taking place.    Trading in forward contracts introduces a possible further impact on liquidity. Because such contracts are executed
 off exchange  between private parties, the time required to offset or  unwind  these positions may be greater than that for regulated instruments. This potential delay could be exacerbated to the extent a counterparty is not a
U.S. person.    Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Fund s futures and forward trading operations, the Fund s
assets are expected to be highly liquid.     CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 The Fund will raise additional capital only through the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital
through borrowings. Due to the nature of the Fund s business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets which are not operating capital or assets.

  Fund results for 3rd Quarter 2016:  
 In September, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced negative returns, with positions in energy, bonds and grains contributing to this decline. The
Fund s allocations to the metals sector were the largest negative contributor, as investors remained skeptical of volatile movements in oil prices amidst concerns that the excess global crude supply could persist into 2017. The Fund s
allocations to agricultural and currencies markets helped to slightly offset the negative results in the month, as positions in the agricultural, currencies and indices markets all yielded positive returns, including the Fund s allocations to
LCE London coffee, CME live cattle and CME mini NASDAQ 100.    In August, the Fund s managed futures strategy yielded negative results, as positions in
the energies and metals sectors dragged on performance. The Fund s positions in NYMEX crude oil and IPE gas oil produced negative returns, as the market moved adversely based on speculation that OPEC would limit oil prices. The Fund s
positions in COMEX silver also underperformed, as investors fled safe-haven assets. The Fund s allocations to the indices, grains and agricultural markets all yielded positive returns, helping to offset some of the losses in other sectors.  
 In July, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced strong positive returns in the midst of heightened market uncertainties and uneasiness as a result
of the United Kingdom s vote to withdraw from the European Union. The Fund s allocation to indices, including positions in CBOE Volatility Index and CME mini NASDAQ 100, produced positive gains as its positions capitalized on recovering
markets. The Fund s allocations to the energies and metals sectors also produced positive returns, particularly its long positions in COMEX silver. The Fund s positions in the agricultural and grains sectors produced negative results, as
better than expected weather conditions for soybeans and increased demand for cotton resulted in adverse price movements to the Fund s positions.  
  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016     Series A:  
 Net results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, were a loss of 7.1% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series A
experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $514,130. This decrease consisted of investment income of $618, trading losses of $380,093 and total expenses of $134,655. Expenses included $31,736 in management fees, $2,573 in operating
expenses, $68,618 in selling commissions, $27,893 in brokerage commissions and $3,835 in other expenses. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Unit of Series A was $1,101.60 and $1,222.26, respectively.  
 Series B:    Net results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016,
were a loss of 9.3% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series B experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $705,881. This decrease consisted of investment income of $792, trading losses of
$554,934 and total expenses of $151,739. Expenses included $32,266 in management fees, $2,616 in operating expenses, $69,764 in selling commissions, $42,748 in brokerage commissions and $4,345 in other expenses. At June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the net asset value per Unit of Series B was $1,241.52 and $1,392.13 respectively.    Fund results for 2nd Quarter 2016:  
 In June, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced positive returns, as the markets came to terms with the United Kingdom s vote to withdraw from
the European Union. In the midst of market volatility and heightened market skepticism, investors fled to safe haven assets. As a result, the Fund s positions in bonds and metals markets produced gains for the Fund. In particular, the
Fund s positions in Euro-Bund, Euro-BOBL and Comex gold yielded significant positive returns for the Fund. The Fund s allocation to grain and agricultural markets also yielded positive results. The Fund s positions in stock indices
and currencies lost ground, partially offsetting the Fund s gains in other markets.    In May, the Fund s managed futures strategy yielded
negative returns. Prospects of a rise in rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve (the  Fed ) in the coming months, as well as reservations about the state of the global economy, weighed on performance of markets worldwide. The Fund s
allocation to metals produced the largest negative returns, with position in Comex gold and silver being the largest contributor. The Fund s short positions in soybean meal also yielded losses as a result of adverse weather conditions in major
growth markets. The Fund s positive positions in bonds helped to offset some of the Fund s negative performance, as the Fund took advantage of declining Treasury prices as well as increasing European bond prices resulting from weak
economic data.

  In April, the Fund s managed futures strategy resulted in negative returns. The Fund s allocation to
the bond and metal markets yielded losses amidst changing global monetary policies and fluctuating oil prices. The Fund s positions in the grains sector also produced negative results. In particular, the Fund s short positions in soybean
meal suffered, as soybean prices rose as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar and bullish Chinese export data. The Fund s allocation to the metals market, particularly long positions in Comex gold and silver, produced positive returns for the
month, as metals saw strong gains throughout April.     Three Months Ended March 31, 2016   
 Series A:    Net results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016,
were a loss of 3.2% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series A experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $244,193. This decrease consisted of investment income of $541, trading losses of
$98,595 and total expenses of $146,139. Expenses included $35,715 in management fees, $2,896 in operating expenses, $77,221 in selling commissions, $26,123 in brokerage commissions and $4,184 in other expenses. At March 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the net asset value per Unit of Series A was $1,183.63 and $1,222.26, respectively.    Series B:  
 Net results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, were a loss of 1.9% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series B
experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $143,062. This decrease consisted of investment income of $776, trading gains of $22,801 and total expenses of $166,639. Expenses included $37,429 in management fees, $3,035 in operating
expenses, $80,927 in selling commissions, $40,522 in brokerage commissions and $4,726 in other expenses. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Unit of Series B was $1,337.50 and $1,392.13 respectively.  
 Fund results for 1st Quarter 2016:    In March, the Fund s
managed futures strategy yielded negative results. The Fund s allocation to the energy sector produced losses as the Fund s short positions lost ground on rising oil prices in the month. The rise in oil prices also helped to rally the Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index, generating a loss for the Fund s short positions. The Fund s long positions in bonds also produced negative results as a result of general rout in global bond prices. The Fund s allocation to the
agricultural market produced negative results, although its positions in London Commodity Exchange sugar helped to partially offset these losses by yielding positive returns. The Fund s allocation to the currencies sector proved to be the sole
positive performing sector for the month, with the Australian dollar trading at its highest level in recent weeks on better than expected economic data.  
 In February, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced positive returns. The Fund s allocation to the bonds market generated strong positive
returns as bond prices advanced on fears of a global slowdown. The Fund s positions in the energy sector also produced positive results, as the Fund s long and short positions took advantage of volatile oil prices. The agricultural sector
also produced positive returns for the Fund, as the Fund s short positions in Chicago Board of Trade soybean meal benefitted from declining sales in the soybean market. The Fund s positions in the currencies markets produced negative
results as positions in the Japanese yen lost value as a result of stimulus measures imposed by the Bank of Japan.    In January, the Fund s managed
futures strategy yielded negative results. The Fund s positions in indices generated losses, as global stock indices were negatively affected by a sell-off in China which spurred a stock market slump worldwide. The Fund s allocation to the
agricultural sector also produced negative returns, as the Fund s long positions in cocoa suffered due to increased supplies, weaker demand and favorable weather for production. The Fund s allocation to the bonds sector helped to partially
offset these losses, producing positive returns as bond prices advanced.     Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Series A:    Net results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015
were a loss of 5.0% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series A experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $416,897. This decrease consisted of interest income of $101, trading losses of
$263,443, and total expenses of $153,555. Expenses included $38,369 in management fees, $3,111 in operating expenses, $82,960 in selling commissions, $25,570 in brokerage commissions, and $3,545 in other expenses. At September 30, 2015 and December
31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit of Series A was $1,156.09 and $1,283.60, respectively.

  Series B:    Net
results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were a loss of 6.9% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series B experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $606,966. This decrease consisted of
interest income of $239, trading losses of $431,999, and total expenses of $175,206. Expenses included $40,097 in management fees, $3,251 in operating expenses, $86,697 in selling commissions, $40,823 in brokerage commissions, and $4,338 in other
expenses. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit of Series B was $1,280.41 and $1,462.68 respectively.    Fund results
for the 3rd Quarter 2015:    In September, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced slightly negative results. The Fund s positions in equity
indices yielded negative returns amid concerns over a global growth decline. The Fund s allocations to grain, metals and agricultural markets also produced overall negative performance, as prices lagged with the decline in global growth. The
Fund s positions in the energy and bonds sector performed positively for the month, helping to partially offset the negative performance from the Fund s positions in equity indices.  
 In August, the Fund s managed futures strategy yielded negative results. The decline in performance was primarily due to the Fund s positions in
equity indices, as global stock markets were turbulent amid uncertainties in the Chinese economy. The Fund s positions in TSE Topix and Osaka Nikkei225 contributed the most to these losses. The Fund s disappointing performance was also
attributable to the Fund s allocation to European bonds, as the Fund was not able to capitalize on intra-month market swings. The Fund s long positions in U.S. bonds yielded positive results, as investors bet on fears that the U.S. Federal
Reserve (the  Fed ) would scale back on an interest rate hike.    In July, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced positive returns. The
Fund s positions in metals, particularly copper, produced strong gains as the market experienced volatility resulting from decreasing demand from China. The Fund s positions in the bond, currency, equities and energy sectors also produced
positive performance in July. With positions in CBOT wheat contributing the most, the Fund s allocations to the grains and agricultural markets yielded negative returns.  
  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015     Series A:  
 Net results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, were a loss of 9.2% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series A
experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $872,981. This decrease consisted of investment income of $116, trading losses of $705,168 and total expenses of $167,929. Expenses included $42,632 in management fees, $3,456 in operating
expenses, $92,177 in selling commissions, $24,897 in brokerage commissions and $4,767 in other expenses. At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit of Series A was $1,216.01 and $1,283.60, respectively.  
 Series B:    Net results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015,
were a loss of 13.6% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series B experienced a net decrease in net assets from operations of $1,413,990. This decrease consisted of investment income of $225, trading losses of
$1,218,759 and total expenses of $195,456. Expenses included $45,226 in management fees, $3,667 in operating expenses, $97,786 in selling commissions, $41,864 in brokerage commissions and $6,913 in other expenses. At June 30, 2015 and December 31,
2014, the net asset value per Unit of Series B was $1,375.18 and $1,462.68 respectively.    Fund results for 2nd Quarter 2015:  
 In April, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced negative results. This performance was partly attributable to the Fund s long bond positions,
as continued issues between Greece and its creditors, the Bank of England s continued policy of low interest rates, and the uncertainty of a U.S. interest rate hike led to large scale sell-offs and falling bond prices. Also contributing to
the Fund s negative return was its long positions in CME Live Cattle, as prices dropped in mid-April due to a lower than expected demand in beef. The Fund s allocation to the energy sector produced positive results, with long positions in
NYMEX Crude Oil benefitting from bullish oil prices. The Fund s allocation to indices also yielded favorable returns as the Nasdaq reached a fifteen-year high.  
      44  

Table of Contents  

  In May, the Fund s managed futures strategy yielded slightly negative returns. The Fund s positions in
the bond sector produced losses on news of increased purchasing by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and increased speculation that Greece would not be able to make future payments to its creditors. Gains from the Fund s allocation to
indices, specifically positions in Topix Index and Osaka Nikkei 225, helped to counter these losses. The Fund s positions in currency, agriculture and metals markets also produced gains for the month.  
 In June, the Fund s managed futures strategy produced a negative return as global indices reacted negatively to continued unsuccessful debt negotiations
between Greece and its creditors, culminating with Greece defaulting on its IMF repayment at the end of the month. The Fund s short positions on the TSE Topix lost ground with the index rising to an eight-year high as Japan looked to re-inflate
its economy. The Fund s allocation to the bond market also produced negative results as German Bunds and UK Gilts yields rose amidst failed negotiations over Greek debt. In addition, the Fund s positions in commodity and metal markets
produced overall negative results, despite gains from positions in soybeans, wheat and aluminum.     Three Months Ended March 31, 2015   
 Series A:    Net results for the quarter ended March 31, 2015,
were a gain of 4.3% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series A experienced a net increase in net assets from operations of $414,926. This increase consisted of investment income of $59, trading gains of
$593,627 and total expenses of $178,860. Expenses included $47,067 in management fees, $3,817 in operating expenses, $101,767 in selling commissions, $23,137 in brokerage commissions and $3,072 in other expenses. At March 31, 2015 and December 31,
2014, the net asset value per Unit of Series A was $1,337.50 and $1,283.60, respectively.    Series B:  
 Net results for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, were a gain of 8.9% in net asset value compared to the preceding quarter end. In this period, Series B
experienced a net increase in net assets from operations of $921,289. This decrease consisted of investment loss of $45, trading gains of $1,142,296 and total expenses of $220,962. Expenses included $52,369 in management fees, $4,247 in operating
expenses, $113,230 in selling commissions, $46,521 in brokerage commissions and $4,595 in other expenses. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit of Series B was $1,589.57 and $1,462.68 respectively.  
 Fund results for 1st Quarter 2015:    In March, the Fund s
managed futures strategy produced flat results, with a negative return of 0.14% for Series A and 0.03% for Series B. The Fund s long positions in cattle and short positions in soybean oil and sugar all produced positive returns. These gains
were offset by losses resulting from the Fund s long positions in indices, as the Nasdaq fell on speculation of increased interest rates by the Fed and a sell-off of biotech and technology stocks. The Fund s long positions in Canadian
bonds also produced negative results, as the Bank of Canada announced that it was maintaining its overnight rate targets.    In February, the Fund s
managed futures strategy produced positive results, primarily on its long positions in indices. In the U.S., the Nasdaq reached its highest level since March 2000. In Japan, both the Tokyo Stock Price Index and the Nikkei 225 both produced
substantial gains in March. The Fund s gains in indices where offset slightly by the Fund s allocations to the energy sector, as the Fund s short positions in oil lost ground. The Fund s allocations to the metals markets also
yielded negative returns.    In January, the Fund s managed futures strategy yielded strong positive results. The Fund s allocations to the bonds
sector brought positive returns as the Bank of Canada lowered its overnight rate to counteract the effect of dropping oil prices on growth. The Fund s positions in the Canadian dollar also performed positively as Canadian GDP figures contracted
while the U.S. dollar strengthened on U.S. jobless claims. The Fund s allocations to the agricultural sector produced negative results in January as hog futures fell on declining demand and cattle futures hit the lowest level since June 2014.
    OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK     The term  off-balance
sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. The Fund trades in futures and forward contracts and is therefore a party to
financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts, there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by conditions, such as interest rate volatility,
resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Fund at the same  
      45  

Table of Contents  

time, and if Superfund Capital Management was unable to offset such positions, the Fund could experience substantial losses. Superfund Capital Management attempts to minimize market risk through
real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio in all but extreme instances not greater than 50%.  
 In addition to market risk, in entering into futures and forward contracts, there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its
obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse
who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some
foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.     OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
 The Fund does not engage in off-balance sheet arrangements.  
  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS     The Fund does not enter into
contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments of a type that would be typical for an operating company. The Fund s sole business is trading futures, currency, forward and certain swap contracts, both long (contracts
to buy) and short (contracts to sell). All such contracts are settled by offset, not delivery. Substantially all such contracts are for settlement within four months of the trade date and substantially all such contracts are held by the Fund for
less than four months before being offset or rolled over into new contracts with similar maturities. The financial statements of Series A and Series B each present a condensed schedule of investments setting forth net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) of such Series  open forward contracts as well as the fair value of the futures contracts purchased and sold by each Series at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   VALUATION OF THE FUND S POSITIONS   
 Superfund Capital Management believes that the accounting policies that will be most critical to the Fund s financial condition and results of operations
relate to the valuation of the Fund s positions. The majority of the Fund s positions will be exchange-traded futures contracts, which will be valued daily at settlement prices published by the exchanges. Any spot and forward
foreign currency or swap contracts held by the Fund will also be valued at published daily settlement prices or at dealers  quotes. Thus, Superfund Capital Management expects that under normal circumstances substantially all of the
Fund s assets will be valued on a daily basis using objective measures.     RECENTLY ADOPTED AND/OR ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
  ASU 2015-14     In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU
2014-09 ). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 affect any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of
other standards. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Superfund Capital Management is evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-14 on the financial statements and disclosures.
