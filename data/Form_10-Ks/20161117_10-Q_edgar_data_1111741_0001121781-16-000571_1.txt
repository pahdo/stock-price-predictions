   NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

 DynaResource, Inc. (The  Company ,
 DynaResource , or  DynaUSA ) was organized September 28, 1937, as a California corporation under the name
of West Coast Mines, Inc.  In 1998, the Company re-domiciled to Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. The
Company is in the business of acquiring, investing in, and developing precious metal properties, and the production of precious
metals. 

 The interim consolidated financial statements
included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
has been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures included
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. 

 In management s opinion, the unaudited
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as at September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, the unaudited Consolidated Statement
of Changes in Shareholders  Equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the unaudited Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, contained herein, reflect all adjustments, consisting
solely of normal recurring items, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results
of operations and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the Company s prior audited annual consolidated financial
statements.  However, the results of operations for the interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for
the full fiscal year.  Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto and summary of significant accounting policies included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
Except as noted below, there have been no material changes in the footnotes from those accompanying the audited consolidated financial
statements contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. 

   NOTE 2   INVENTORY   

 Inventories are carried at the lower
of cost or net realized value and consist of mined tonnage, gravity-flotation concentrates, and gravity tailings (or, flotation
feed material). Inventory balances of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were as follows: 

The significant in inventory is due
to the increase in mining production and staging the materials from mine to crusher and final consolidation for shipment to the
refiner. 

   NOTE 3   INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATE/RECEIVABLES
FROM AFFILIATE/OTHER ASSETS   

 DynaResource Nevada, Inc., a Nevada
Corporation ( DynaNevada ), with one operating subsidiary in M xico, DynaNevada de M xico, S.A. de C.V.
( DynaNevada de M xico ) have common officers, directors and shareholders. The total amount loaned by the Company
to DynaNevada at December 31, 2010 was $805,760. The terms of the Note Receivable provided for a  Convertible Loan, 
repayable at 5% interest over a 3-year period, and convertible at the Company s option into Common Stock of DynaNevada at
$0.25 / Share.  On December 31, 2010, the Company converted its receivable from DynaNevada into 3,223,040 Shares of DynaNevada;
and as a result, the Company owns 19.92% of the outstanding share capital of DynaNevada. DynaNevada is a related entity, and through
its subsidiary in M xico (DynaNevada de M xico), ( DynaNevada de M xico ), entered into an Option
agreement with Grupo M xico ( IMMSA ) in M xico, for the exploration and development of approximately
3,000 hectares in the State of San Luis Potosi ( the Santa Gertrudis Property ). In March, 2010, DynaNevada de M xico
completed the Option with IMMSA so that it now owns 100% of Santa Gertrudis. In June, 2010, DynaNevada de M xico acquired
an additional 6,000 Hectares in the State of Sinaloa ( the San Juan Property ). The Company has loaned additional funds
to DynaNevada since 2010 for maintenance of concessions and other nominal required fees and expenses. The Company currently has
a receivable from DynaResource Nevada, Inc. of $141,686 and an investment balance of $70,000 as of September 30, 2016. The balances
as of December 31, 2015 were $159,143 in receivables and $70,000 in investment, respectively. 

NOTE 4   CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY
NOTES   

  Notes Payable   Series I  

 In April and May, 2013, the Company entered
into note agreements with shareholders in the principal amount of $1,495,000, of which $340,000 was then converted to common shares
within the same year, netting to proceeds of $1,155,000 (the  Series I Notes ). The Series I Notes bear simple interest
at twelve and a half percent (12.5%), accrued for twelve months, and with the accrued interest to be added to the principal,
and then interest will be paid by the Company, quarterly in arrears. The holders of the Series I Notes (in aggregate) are
also entitled to receive ten percent (10%) of the net profits received by the Company, and generated from the bulk sampling
material (if any, and up to fifty thousand tonnes) processed through the existing, or improved mill facilities at San Jose
de Gracia. Such net profits (if any) are to be calculated after deducting all expenses related to the processing of the bulk
sample material, and after a prior deduction of thirty-three percent (33%) from the profits, to be deposited in
a sinking fund cash reserve. This net profit percentage (if any) would be paid quarterly in arrears based on the profits generated
(if any) for the prior quarter. At the time of the issuance of the Series I Notes, there were no proven or probable reserves
and the Company had not produced any net profits. Consequently, the fair value of the net profits interest on the date of the Series
I Note was deemed to be zero. Further, no payments of net profits have been made under the terms of the Series I Notes. The Series
I Notes originally matured on December 31, 2015. In April, 2015, the Series I Notes were extended to December 31, 2016. 

 The Company has the right to prepay the
Series I Notes with a ten percent (10%) penalty. 

 The Series I Note holder retains the
option, at any time prior to maturity or prepayment, to convert any unpaid principal and accrued interest into Common Stock at
$5.00 per share. If the Series I Note is converted into Common Stock, at the time of conversion, the holder would also receive
warrants, in the same number as the number of common shares received upon conversion, to purchase additional common shares of the
Company for $7.50 per share, with such warrants expiring on December 31, 2015. 

 In 2013, the Company offered an inducement
to all Series I Note holders to convert their Series I Notes and accrued interest into Series B Preferred Stock ( Series
B ), $5/Share, which Series B was convertible into common stock on a 2 for 1 basis (i.e., $2.50 stock). This conversion into
Series B created $197,771 in inducement expense, with an offset to additional paid in capital. In 2013, $340,000 principal and
$22,734 of capitalized accrued interest of the Series I Notes were converted into Preferred Stock, Series B and 72,546 shares were
issued. At June 30, 2014, these 72,546 Series B shares were converted into 145,092 common shares. 

 In April, 2015, the Company received
note extensions (allonges) from all Series I Note holders to ensure that all Series I Notes were in good standing, and to extend
the maturity date of the Series I Notes to December 31, 2016. 

  Notes Payable   Series II  

 In 2013 and 2014, the Company entered
into additional note agreements of $199,808 and $250,000, respectively (the  Series II Notes ) with similar terms as
the Series I Notes. The Series II Notes bear simple interest at twelve and a half percent (12.5%), accrued for twelve months, and
with the accrued interest to be added to the principal, and then interest will be paid by the Company, quarterly
in arrears. The holders of the Series II Notes (in aggregate) are also entitled to receive ten percent (10%) of the net profits
received by the Company, and generated from the bulk sampling material (if any, on the second fifty thousand tonnes) processed
through the existing, or improved mill facilities at San Jose de Gracia. Such net profits (if any) are to be calculated after
deducting all expenses related to the processing of the bulk sample material, and after a prior deduction of thirty-three
percent (33%) from the profits, to be deposited in a sinking fund cash reserve. This net profit percentage (if any) would be
paid quarterly in arrears based on the profits generated (if any) for the prior quarter. At the time of the Series II notes,
there were no proven or probable reserves and the Company had not produced any net profits. Consequently, the fair value of the
net profits interest on the date of the Series II Notes was deemed to be zero. Further, no payments of net profits have been made
under the terms of the Series II Notes. The Series II Notes mature on December 31, 2016. 

 The Company has the right to prepay the
Series II Notes with a ten percent (10%) penalty. 

 Each Series II Note holder may, at any
time prior to maturity or prepayment, convert any unpaid principal and accrued interest into common stock of the Company at $5.00
per share. At the time of conversion, the holder would receive a warrant to purchase additional common shares of the Company for
$7.50 per share, such warrant expiring on December 31, 2016. 

 In April, 2015, the Company received
allonges (note extensions) from all Series II Note holders to ensure that all Series II Notes were in good standing and confirmed
the maturity of the Series II Notes to be December 31, 2016. 

 On June 30, 2015, the Company entered
into conversion agreements with six (6) Series II Note holders. Principal and interest in the amount of $809,784 plus $33,120 of
accrued interest (total of $842,904) was contracted to convert into 337,162 common shares. In addition, 337,162 warrants are to
be issued which provide the option to purchase common shares at $2.50, with all warrants expiring December 31, 2017. The Company
recorded $826,347 inducement expense related to these conversion transactions. On August 17, 2015, these common shares and warrants
were issued. 

 The Company evaluated the application
of ASC 470-50 and ASC 470-60 and determined that the Series II Notes were not substantially different. As a result, it was concluded
that the revised terms constituted a debt modification rather than a debt extinguishment. 

At September 30, 2016, the principal
and capitalized interest balance on the remaining Series I Notes was $765,000 and the principal and capitalized interest on the
Series II Notes was $191,250, for a total Note balance of $956,250. The accrued interest for these notes were $29,883 and $29,883
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

   NOTE 7   COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES   

 The Company is required to pay taxes
in M xico in order to maintain mining concessions owned by DynaM xico.  Additionally, the Company is required
to incur a minimum amount of expenditures each year for all concessions held.  The minimum expenditures are calculated
based upon the land area, as well as the age of the concessions.  Amounts spent in excess of the minimum may be carried
forward indefinitely over the life of the concessions, and are adjusted annually for inflation.  Based on Management s
business plans, the Company does not anticipate that DynaM xico will have any issues in meeting the minimum annual expenditures
for the concessions, and DynaM xico retains sufficient carry-forward amounts to cover over 20 years of the minimum expenditure
(as calculated at the 2012 minimum, adjusted for annual inflation of 4%). 

In
addition to the surface rights held by DynaM xico pursuant to the  Mining Act  of M xico and its Regulations
( Ley Minera y su Reglamento ), DynaMineras maintains access and surface rights to the SJG Project pursuant to the 20-year
Land Lease Agreement.  The  20 Year Land Lease Agreement with the Santa Maria Ejido
Community surrounding San Jose de Gracia was dated January 6, 2014 and continues through 2033. It covers an area of 4,399 hectares
surrounding the main mineral resource areas of SJG, and provides for annual lease payments by DynaMineras of $1,359,443 Pesos (approx.
$104,250 USD), commencing in 2014.  The Land Lease Agreement provides DynaMineras with surface access to the core resource
areas of SJG (4,399 hectares), and allows for all permitted mining and exploration activities from the owners of the surface rights
(Santa Maria Ejido community). 

 In September 2008, the Company entered
into a 37-month lease agreement for its corporate office.  In August, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 the Company entered
into a one-year extension of the lease through August 31, 2016. The Company paid rent expense of $51,663 and $45,496 related to
this lease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

  Other Contingencies

The Company's mining and exploration
activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations
are continually changing and generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect public health
and the environment, and believes its operations are materially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company
has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. 

  Damages Awarded to DynaM xico
in M xico Litigation  

 On October 5, 2015, DynaResource de M xico
SA de C.V. ( DynaM xico ), was awarded in excess of $48 M USD (Forty-Eight Million Dollars) in damages from
Goldgroup Resources, Inc. (the  Goldgroup Damages ) by virtue of a Sentencia Definitiva (the  Definitive Sentence )
issued by the Thirty Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice of the Federal District of M xico (Tribunal Superior
de Justicia del Distrito Federal), File number 1120/2014. The Definitive Sentence included the considerations and resolutions by
the Court, and additional Resolutions were also ordered in favor of DynaM xico (together the Goldgroup Damages and the additional
Resolutions are referred to as, the  Oct. 5, 2015 Resolution ). The October 5, 2015 Resolution is described below;
See Litigation below, and see Part II, Item 1., Legal Proceedings. 

  Litigation  

 The Company believes that no material
adverse change will occur as a result of the actions taken, and the Company further believes that there is little to no potential
for the assessment of a material monetary judgment against the Company for legal actions it has filed in M xico. (See Part
II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings.) 

   NOTE 8   NON-CONTROLLING
INTEREST   

 The Company s Non-Controlling Interest
recorded in the consolidated financial statements relates to an interest in DynaResource de M xico, S.A. de C.V. of 20%.
Changes in Non-Controlling Interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively were as follows: 

The Company began allocating a portion
of other comprehensive income (loss) to the non-controlling interest with the adoption of ASC 160 as of January 1, 2009. However,
this amount is only reflected in the income statement. 

   NOTE 9   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

  Revenues from Previous Delivery and
Sale of Gold Concentrates (Third Quarter 2016)  

 In October 2016, the Company, through
its wholly owned subsidiary DynaMineras, reported the receipt of a total of $518,609 as payment for the sale of gold concentrates
produced in September and delivered for sale on September 30, 2016. This amount was recorded as accounts receivable at September

settlement). 

 On October 30-31, DynaMineras reported
the delivery for sale of 550 gross oz. gold concentrates (exact weights in gold and silver concentrates to be determined at final
settlement). 

NOTE 10   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
 
 The ASC guidance for fair value measurements
and disclosure establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below: 

  Level 1 Inputs    Quoted
prices for identical instruments in active markets. 

  Level 2 Inputs    Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;
and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

  Level 3 Inputs    Instruments
with primarily unobservable value drivers. 

 As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, the Company s financial assets were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs, with the exception of cash, which
was valued using Level 1 inputs. A description of the valuation of the Level 3 inputs is discussed in Note 11. 

  Fair Value Measurement at September 30,
2016 Using:  

NOTE 11   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   

   Preferred Series C Stock   

 The Company analyzed the embedded conversion
features of the Series C Preferred Stock and determined that the stock qualified as a derivative liability and is required to be
bifurcated and accounted for as such since the host and the embedded instrument are not clearly and closely related. The Company
performed a valuation of the conversion feature. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the guidance in ASC 820,   Fair
Value Measurements ,  to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). To measure fair value, the Company incorporates assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and utilizes market data to the maximum extent possible. 

 In instances where the determination
of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value
hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

 The Company considered the inputs in
this valuation to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 and used an equity simulation model to determine the value
of conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock based on the assumptions below: 

For the period ended September 30, 2016,
an active market for the Company s common stock did not exist. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company s common
stock was estimated using a valuation model with level 3 inputs. 

 It was determined that the estimated valuation
of the stock price at June 30, 2016 of $1.50 changed to $1.64 as of September 30, 2016. The adjustment for the three-month period
ending September 30, 2016 was $(204,279). The net change for the nine-period ending September 30, 2016 was $0. 

 The below table represents the change
in the fair value of the derivative liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015: 

Preferred Series C Warrants   

 The Company analyzed the embedded conversion
features of the Series C Preferred Stock and determined that the Warrants qualified as a derivative liability and is required to
be bifurcated and accounted for as such since the host and the embedded instrument are not clearly and closely related. The Company
performed a valuation of the conversion feature. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the guidance in ASC 820,   Fair
Value Measurements ,  to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). To measure fair value, the Company incorporates assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and utilizes market data to the maximum extent possible. 

 In instances where the determination
of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value
hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

 The Company considered the inputs in
this valuation to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 and used an equity simulation model to determine the value
of conversion feature of the Warrants based on the assumptions below: 

For the year ended December 31, 2015,
an active market for the Company s common stock did not exist. Accordingly, the fair value of the Company s common
stock was estimated using a valuation model with level 3 inputs.

in the fair value of the derivative liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015: 

The functional currency for the subsidiaries
of the Company is the Mexican Peso.  As a result, the financial statements of the subsidiaries have been re-measured
from Mexican Pesos into U.S. dollars using (i) current exchange rates for monetary asset and liability accounts, (ii) historical
exchange rates for nonmonetary asset and liability accounts, (iii) historical exchange rates for revenues and expenses associated
with nonmonetary assets and liabilities and (iv) the weighted average exchange rate of the reporting period for all other revenues
and expenses.  In addition, foreign currency translation gains and losses are reported as a separate component of stockholders 
equity (comprehensive income (loss). 

 The financial statements of the subsidiaries
should not be construed as representations that Mexican Pesos have been, could have been or may in the future be converted into
U.S. dollars at such rates or any other rates. 

Relevant exchange rates used in the preparation
of the financial statements for the subsidiaries are as follows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

  CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS INFORMATION
CONCERNING PREPARATION OF RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES  

 The Company is an  OTC Reporting
Issuer  as that term is defined in BC Multilateral Instrument 51-105,  Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-Counter Markets ,
promulgated by the British Columbia Securities Commission. 

 In Canada, an issuer is required to provide
technical information with respect to mineralization, including reserves and resources, if any, on its mineral exploration properties
in accordance with Canadian requirements, which differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) applicable to registration statements and reports filed by United States companies
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. As such, certain disclosures of mineralization under Canadian standards may
not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements
of the SEC and not subject to Canadian securities legislation. 

 While these terms are recognized and
required by Canadian securities legislation (under National Instrument 43-101 ( NI 43-101 ), entitled  Standards
of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ), the SEC does not recognize these terms. Investors in the United States are cautioned not
to assume that any part or all, of the mineral deposits in these categories, will ever be converted to reserves. In addition, inferred
mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed
that all or any part of a measured mineral resource, indicated mineral resource or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded
to a higher category. Under Canadian securities legislation, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of
feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, although they may form, in certain circumstances, the basis of a  preliminary economic
assessment  as that term is defined in NI 43-101. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all, of any
reported measured, indicated, or inferred mineral resource estimates referred to in the DynaM xico NI 43-101 Technical Report
and DynaM xico 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate (compiled for DynaResource de Mexico SA de CV), are economically or legally
mineable. 

 Under U.S. standards, as set forth
in SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a  reserve  unless a determination has been made that
the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SJG
Property as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is without known reserves. Mineral resources which are not classified
as mineral reserves do not have  demonstrated economic viability.  The quantity of resources and the quality (grade)
of resources reported as  Indicated  and  Inferred  mineral resources in the DynaM xico 43-101 Mineral
Resource Estimate compiled for DynaResource de Mexico SA de CV, under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and filed by the Company
with SEDAR, are  not disclosed in this Form 10-Q . There has been insufficient exploration to define any mineral reserves
on the SJG Property, and it is not certain if further exploration will result in the definition of mineral reserves. 

Company  

 The Company is a minerals investment,
management, and exploration company, and currently conducting test mining and pilot milling operations through an operating subsidiary
in M xico, with specific focus on precious and base metals in M xico. The Company was incorporated in the State of
California on September 28, 1937, under the name West Coast Mines, Inc. In November 1998, the Company re-domiciled from California
to Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. ( DynaUSA ). 

 We currently conduct operations in M xico
through our operating subsidiaries. We currently own 80% of the outstanding shares of DynaResource de M xico, S.A. de C.V.
( DynaM xico ). DynaM xico owns 100% of mining concessions, equipment, camp and related facilities which
comprise the San Jose de Gracia Property, in northern Sinaloa State, M xico. We also own 100% of Mineras de DynaResource
S.A. de C.V. ( DynaMineras ), the exclusive operator of the San Jos  de Gracia Project, under contract with
DynaM xico. 

 In 2000, the Company formed DynaResource
de M xico S.A. de C.V. ( DynaM xico ) for the purpose of acquiring and holding mineral properties and
mining concessions in M xico and, specifically for acquiring and consolidating the Mining District of San Jose de Gracia.
DynaM xico completed the consolidation of the entire SJG District to DynaM xico in 2003 (approx. 15 sq. km. at that
time), with the exception of the San Miguel Mining Concession (7 Hectares, for which DynaM xico is proceeding towards accomplishing
the transfer of title, under previously signed sale and purchase agreements). 

 In 2005, the Company formed Mineras de
DynaResource S.A. de C.V. ( DynaMineras ), a wholly owned subsidiary. DynaMineras entered into an operating agreement
with DynaM xico on April 15, 2005. As a consequence of that agreement and subsequent amendments to that agreement, DynaMineras
is the exclusive operating entity for the SJG Project. 

 Also in 2005, the Company formed another
wholly owned subsidiary, DynaResource Operaciones, S.A. de C.V. ( DynaOperaciones ). DynaOperaciones entered into a
personnel management agreement with DynaMineras and, as a consequence of that agreement, is the exclusive management company for
personnel and consultants involved at the SJG Project. 

 DynaM xico currently owns a portfolio
of mining concessions, equipment, camp and related facilities which comprise the San Jos  de Gracia Project ( SJG ).
The mining concessions cover 69,121 hectares (170,802 acres) on the west side of the Sierra Madre mountain range, in northern Sinaloa
State. 

 The Company currently owns 80% of the
outstanding shares of DynaM xico. We also own 100% of Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. ( DynaMineras ),
the exclusive operator of the San Jos  de Gracia Project, under contract with DynaM xico, and we own 100% of DynaResource
Operaciones de San Jose de Gracia, S.A. de C.V., ( DynaOperaciones ), a company which manages the personnel registered
to work at the San Jose de Gracia Project. 

  San Jose de Gracia - History  

 Historical production records from
San Jose de Gracia ( SJG ) report 1,000,000 Oz gold production from a series of underground workings. The major areas
report 471,000 Oz. produced at the La Purisima area of SJG, at an average grade of 66.7 g/t.; and 215,000 Oz. produced from the
La Prieta area, at an average grade of 27.6 g/t. Mineralization at SJG has been traced on surface and underground over 15 sq. km. 

 DynaM xico was formed in
March 2000, for the purpose of acquiring the concessions comprising the SJG District, and to consolidate all ownership of SJG under
DynaM xico. DynaM xico focused on acquisition and consolidation work through 2003, and reported a virtually clear
title and consolidated ownership to the district at December 31, 2013. 

  Drilling   Exploration Programs
(1997   2000)  

 A drill program was conducted at SJG
in 1997 to 1998 by a prior majority owner. Approximately 6,172 meters drilling was completed in 63 core drill holes. Significant
intercepts, including bonanza grades, outlined the down dip potential of the Northeast section (150 Meter NE to SW extent of the
Drilling) of the Los Hilos to Tres Amigos Trend of SJG. Surface and underground sampling in 1999 to 2000 confirmed high grades
in historic workings and surface exposures throughout the project area. These high grades outline the presence of mineralization
shoots developed within the veins. The mineralized shoots appear to be controlled by dilational jogs and/or vein intersections.
A total of 544 samples were collected in 1999 to 2000, and assayed an average 6.51 g/t gold. 

  Structure of Company / Operations  

 Activities in M xico are currently
conducted by DynaMineras; with the management of personnel being contracted by DynaMineras through to DynaOperaciones. Executive
Management of DynaResource, Inc. and consultants manage the operating companies in M xico; while the Chairman/CEO of DynaUSA
is the President of each of DynaM xico, DynaMineras and DynaOperaciones. Fees for management and administration are charged
by DynaMineras and DynaOperaciones, which are eliminated in consolidation. 

  Exclusive Operating Entity at
San Jose de Gracia  

 Under agreement with DynaM xico,
Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. ( DynaMineras ) has been named the exclusive operating entity at the San Jose
de Gracia Project. DynaResource owns 100% of DynaMineras. 

DynaM xico General Powers of
Attorney  

 The Chairman-CEO of DynaUSA also serves
as the President of DynaM xico. The President of DynaM xico holds broad powers of attorney granted by the shareholders
of DynaM xico which gives the current President significant and broad authority within DynaM xico. 

  Company Ownership and Description
of Subsidiaries  

 A description of the subsidiaries owned
by the Company and its ownership in each is summarized below: 

  DynaResource de M xico, S.A.
de C.V.:  80% Owned by DynaResource, Inc. 

100% owner of the San Jose de Gracia Property;   

  Mineras de DynaResource, S.A. de C.V.:  100%
Owned by DynaResource, Inc. 

Exclusive Operator of the San Jose de Gracia Project;   

Entered into Exploitation Agreement ( EAA ) with DynaM xico (See EAA below);   

Entered into a 20-year Surface Rights Agreement with the Santa Maria Ejido (See Surface Rights Agreement below);   

  DynaResource Operaciones de San Jose
de Gracia, S.A. de C.V.:  100% Owned by DynaResource, Inc. 

Personnel Management Company at San Jose de Gracia;   

  Pilot Production Activities (2003
  2006)  

 DynaM xico, conducting operations
through DynaMineras, mined high-grade veins at the San Pablo area of SJG from mid-2003 to June 2006. 18,250 Oz. gold was produced
and sold from mill feed tonnage of 42,000 tonnes, at an average grade of approximately 15-20 g/t. Production costs were reported
at approximately $175/Oz. gold in this small scale, pilot production operation (See results in table below). The pilot operations
at SJG consisted of the installation of a gravity/flotation processing circuit to an existing mill, and initial test runs with
tailings were completed in 2002. Actual test mining at the high-grade San Pablo area of the property commenced in March 2003. 

Suspension of Production Activities (2006)  

 The Company initiated the test production
activity in 2003 and, at that time, gold prices were depressed. Exploration funding opportunities, while available, were deemed
to be too dilutive by Company management. Subsequently, in 2006, commodities prices were improving and the Company was able to
negotiate financing in order to fund exploration activities. Therefore, the Company suspended test mining activities in 2006 in
order to focus on the exploration of the vast SJG District. While the test mining and pilot milling operations were considered
successful (see results in the table above), a small-scale production operation was not expected to provide the necessary capital
in order to fund exploration of the vast SJG District. The limited-scope pilot production activity provided significant benefits
through confirmation of production grades, metallurgy and process, efficiency of recoveries, and production costs. 

  Drilling programs (2007  
2011)  

 Drilling programs completed by the
Company s subsidiaries produced a total of 298 drill holes covering 68,741 meters of drilling from 2007 through March 2011.
Results of the drilling activity, including the results of previous drilling in 1997-1998, appear in an  SJG Drill Intercepts
Summary File through 11-298 , as Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011 filed with the SEC on August
22, 2011, and available on EDGAR at: [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1111741/000112178111000241/ex99one.htm]. Additionally,
the updated Drill Summary File is posted on the Company s web site at www.dynaresource.com. 

  Technical Report According to Canadian National Instrument
43-101 (2012)  

 In 2012, DynaM xico commissioned
 Servicios y Proyectos Mineros  ( SPM ) for the production of a Technical
Report according the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 ( the DynaM xico NI 43-101 Technical Report ) at San
Jose de Gracia. Additionally, DynaM xico commissioned Mr. Robert Sandefur, a senior reserve analyst for Chlumsky, Armbrust
  Meyer LLC, Lakewood, CO ( CAM ) to produce a mineral resource estimate for the 4 main vein systems at the property
(the  DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate ). 

Parameters Used to Estimate the DynaM xico
NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate-- The data base for the San Jose de Gracia Project consists of 372 drill holes of which
361 are diamond drill holes ( DDH ) and the remaining 11 were reverse circulation holes  (RC ), with a
total drilling of 75,878 meters. The DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate, prepared in 2012, concentrates on four
main mineralized vein systems at SJG: Tres Amigos, San Pablo, La Union, and La Purisima. Of the 372 drill holes, 368 were drilled
to test these four main vein systems and the remaining four holes tested the Argillic Zone. Technical personnel of Minop S.A. de
C.V. ( Minop ), a subsidiary (or affiliate) of Goldgroup Mining Inc. built three dimensional solids to constrain estimation
to the interpreted veins in each swarm. The 172 holes most recently drilled (2009-2011), were allocated as follows: Tres Amigos
(64 holes), San Pablo (49 holes), La Union (24 holes), La Purisima (32 holes) and Argillic Zone (3 holes). The data base also includes
rock and chip sampling, regional stream sediment sampling, and IP Surveys. 

  Density-- A total of 5,540 pieces
of core were measured for specific gravity using the weight in air vs. weight in water method. This represents an additional 3,897
measurements taken in the 2009-11 drill seasons with density measurements taken from all mineral zones. Dried samples were coated
with paraffin wax before being measured. The results tabulated have been sorted by lithology and mineralized veins. The average
specific gravity of 5,051 wall rock samples was 2.59 while the average specific gravity for 489 samples of vein material is 2.68.
CAM and Servicios y Proyectos Mineros have reviewed the procedures and results, and opine that the results are suitable for use
in mineral resource estimation. 

  DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral
Resource Estimate - Construction of Wireframes-- Mineral Resources were estimated by Mr. Sandefur within wireframes constructed
by technical personnel of Minop. Minop was contracted by DynaMineras. 

  DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral
Resource Estimate - Explanation of Resource Estimation-- Resource estimation was done in MineSight and MicroModel computer systems
with only those composites that were inside the wireframe used in the estimate. Estimation was done using kriging with the omni-directional
variogram derived from all the data in each area for gold using the relative variogram derived from the log variogram. High grades
were restricted by capping the assays at a breakpoint based on the cumulative frequency curves. Estimation was done using search
radii of 100 x 100 x 50 m  blocks  oriented subparallel to the general strike and dip of the vein system in each area.
A sector search, corresponding to the faces of the search box with a maximum of two points per sector was used in estimation. A
density of 2.68 based on within  vein density  samples was used in the resource estimate. Within each of the four areas
there are approximately 20 to 40 veins in the vein swarm. Resources were estimated by kriging using data from all veins in the
swarm. In general, gold accounts for at least 80% of the value of contained metal at the SJG Project, so the variograms for gold
were used in estimation of the four other metals. 

 The veins at San Jose de Gracia have
been historically mined for many years and historic mined volumes are not available. The one exception is the approximate 42,000
tonnes of ore processed by DynaM xico during its pilot production activities in 2003-2006. The resource table is not adjusted
for any historic mining. To validate that historic mining had not significantly reduced the resource, CAM reviewed the database
for all assays greater than 1 gram per ton gold that were next to missing values at the bottom of drill holes. Only four assays
satisfying this criterion were found, and on the basis of this review, Mr. Sandefur does not believe that significant mining has
occurred within the volumes defined by the wireframes. 

  Servicios
y Proyectos Mineros  performed a database review and considers that a reasonable level of verification has been completed,
and that no material issues have been left unidentified from the drilling programs undertaken. 

  DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral
Resource Estimate and  DynaM xico  NI 43-101 Technical Report - Data Verification-- Mr. Ramon Luna Espinoza ( Mr.
Luna ) initially visited the San Jose de Gracia Project in November 2010, and conducted site inspections at SJG in November
2011 and January 2012. Mr. Sandefur conducted a site inspection of the SJG Project in January 2012.  While
at the Property in November 2011, Mr. Luna inspected the areas of Tres Amigos, La Prieta, Gossan Cap, San Pablo, La Union, and
La Purisima, and historic mining sites. In January 2012, Mr. Sandefur and Mr. Luna inspected the areas of Tres Amigos, San Pablo,
La Union, and La Purisima. Pictures of the areas were taken. Many of the drill pads for the drilling programs of 2007 to 2011 were
clearly located and identified. Mr. Luna also inspected San Jos  de Gracia s core logging and storage facilities,
the geology offices, the meteorological station, the plant nursery, and the mill. Mr. Sandefur also inspected San Jos  de
Gracia s core logging and storage facilities.  

 The Company received from DynaM xico
on February 14, 2012, a Mineral Resource Estimate according to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 for San Jose de Gracia (the
 DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate ). The DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate
was prepared by Mr. Robert Sandefur, BS, MSc, P.E., a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101, and a senior reserve analyst
for Chlumsky, Armbrust   Meyer LLC, Lakewood, CO ( CAM ). The DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate
concentrates on four separate main vein systems at SJG: Tres Amigos, San Pablo, La Union, and La Purisima. 

 The 
 DynaM xico  NI 43-101 Mineral     Resource  
  Estimate     prepared  
 by   Mr.    Robert  
  Sandefur     for  
  the    DynaM xico 
NI 43-101 Technical     Report  
  included     Indicated  
  Resources     at  
  Tres     Amigos
and San Pablo  .    The 
 DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral Resource   Estimate  
  also     included  
  an     Inferred  
  Resource     for  
 the    four  
  vein     systems.
Table     summaries  
of Indicated and Inferred Resources are contained in  the    DynaM xico
NI 43-101 Mineral     Resource  
  Estimate. The  DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral  Resource
Estimate has been filed, along with the  DynaM xico  NI 43-101 Technical Report,
on SEDAR; but is  not disclosed in this Form 10-Q.   

  Updated Technical Report According
to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (2012)  

 The Company received from DynaM xico,
an updated Technical Report according to Canadian National Instrument 43-101, which included the DynaM xico NI 43-101 Mineral
Resource Estimate (the  Updated DynaM xico NI 43-101 Technical Report ). The Updated DynaM xico NI 43-101
Technical Report was approved by DynaM xico, and filed by the Company on SEDAR; but is  not disclosed in this Form 10-Q . 

No Known Reserves  

 The SJG property is without known
reserves. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a  reserve  unless a determination has been
made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. 

  Exploitation Amendment Agreement ( EAA )  

 On May 15, 2013, DynaMineras entered
into an Exploitation Amendment Agreement ( EAA ) with DynaM xico. The EAA grants to DynaMineras the right to
finance, explore, develop and exploit the SJG Property, in exchange for: 

 (a) Reimbursement of all costs
associated with financing, maintenance, exploration, development and exploitation of the SJG Property, which costs are to be charged
and billed by DynaMineras to DynaM xico; and, 

 (b) After Item (A) above, the receipt
by DynaMineras of 75% of gross receipts received by DynaM xico from the sale of all minerals produced from SJG, to the point
that DynaMineras has received 200% of its advanced funds; and, 

 (c) after items (A) and (B) above;
the receipt by DynaMineras of 50% of all gross receipts received by DynaM xico from the sale of all minerals produced from
SJG, and throughout the term of the EAA; and, 

 (d) in addition to Items (A), (B),
and (C) above, DynaMineras shall receive a 2.5% NSR ( Net Smelter Royalty ) on all minerals sold from SJG over the
term of the EAA. 

 The total unpaid advances made by DynaMineras
to DynaM xico as of September 30, 2016 is $2,107,500. The EAA is the third and latest Amendment to the original Contract
Mining Services and Mineral Production Agreement (the  Operating Agreement ), which was previously entered into by
DynaMineras with DynaM xico in April 2005, wherein DynaMineras was named the Exclusive Operating Entity at SJG. The Operating
Agreement was previously amended in September 2006 (the  First Amendment ), and amended again at July 15, 2011 (the
 Second Amendment ). The Term of the Second Amendment is 20 years, and the EAA (Third Amendment) provides for the continuation
of the 20 Year Term from the date of the Second Amendment (July 15, 2011).

January 6, 2014 DynaMineras entered into a 20-year surface rights agreement with   the
Santa Maria Ejido Community surrounding the San Jose de Gracia Property (the  20 Year SRA ). The 20 Year SRA covers
an area of 4,399 hectares surrounding the main mineral resource areas of SJG, and provides for annual lease payments by DynaMineras
of $1,359,443 Pesos (approx. $85,000 USD), commencing in 2014.  The 20 year SRA provides DynaMineras with surface access
to the core resource areas of SJG, and allows for all permitted mining, pilot production and exploration activities from the owners
of the surface rights (Santa Maria Ejido community). 

  Additionally,
DynaMineras expects to construct a Medical Facility and a Community Center within the SJG community in year 2015. DynaMineras reports
that land and building for which the medical facility and community center will be constructed have been approved for re-zoning
by the local community; and plans are being drawn for constructing the facilities.  

  Rehabilitation and Start-up of Pilot
Mill Facility at San Jose de Gracia  

 Under the terms of the Exploitation Amendment
Agreement ( EAA ), as described above, DynaMineras has rehabilitated the pilot mill facility at SJG and it has rehabilitated
the San Pablo mine. The SJG pilot mill facility (a gravimetric-flotation circuit) is designed to process bulk samples mined from
selected target areas of SJG, including San Pablo. Operations at SJG are managed by DynaMineras, and are projected to be similar
to those conducted by DynaM xico during 2003-2006. 

  Test Underground Mining and Pilot Mill Operations (2014)  

 Operational Permits for the rehabilitation
of the San Pablo Mine and for the refurbishment of the Pilot Mill Facility including the installation of the Tailings Pond area
adjacent to the pilot mill facility were obtained in fall, 2013, leading to the rehabilitation of the San Pablo Mine and the refurbishing
of the Pilot Mill Facility in 2014. Pilot Production Operations, including test underground mining activity commenced in October
2014, with approximately 1,676 Oz. Gold being delivered for sale during the startup testing phase. 

Test Underground Mining
and Pilot Mill Operations (2015)  

 In July, 2015 The Company commenced a
capital investment program designed to increase tonnage and output from the test mining operations and pilot mill operations, and
to increase volume and output through the pilot mill facility. Through DynaMineras, the Company was engaged in the implementation
of this capital investment program from July through December, 2015. As a result, the Company projected that mining and milling
volumes would approach 100 tons/day of mineralized material, in January, 2016. 

  Capital Investment (2015 ) 

 The capital investment program consisted
of a net total of $3,565,000 USD and is generally described below: 

  Contract Mining ($713,000); 
including $250,000 Deposit (advance for services), and $513,000 in direct mining costs, explosives, and payments to contractor; 

  Mine related costs ($290,000 );
including mine plan development, permits, assays, consulting, mine supplies, and equipment items expensed; 

  Mill and Camp ($613,000); 
Improvements to the Mill and Camp, including pre-operation expenses; 

  Personnel Costs
($673,000 ); including payroll and consulting expenses; 

Equipment ($636,000 ); long term equipment purchases including transportation, mine loading
and hauling, generators, compressors and pumps;   

  Overhead ($285,000 );
including legal expenses, consulting, and administration; 

  IVA ($272,000); 
Value added taxes paid, and refundable; 

  Land Use and Rental
($83,000) ; 

  Summary of Test Mining and Pilot Mill
Operations  

 DynaMineras reports the following summary
of its test mining and pilot milling operations during 2015: 

Test Underground Mining and Pilot
Mill Operations (First Quarter 2016)  

 At March, 31 2016, DynaMineras reports
the following summary of its test mining and pilot milling operations conducted in the first quarter, 2016: 

Test Underground Mining and Pilot
Mill Operations (Second Quarter 2016)  

 At June 30, 2016, DynaMineras reports
the following summary of its test mining and pilot milling operations conducted in the second quarter, 2016: 

Test Underground Mining and Pilot
Mill Operations (Third Quarter 2016)  

 At September 30, 2016, DynaMineras reports
the following summary of its test mining and pilot milling operations conducted in the third quarter, 2016: 

DynaMineras expects to continue its test underground mining
activity and pilot milling operations in third quarter 2016; and projects the increased output from 150 tons/day to 200 tons/day
from the mine and mill in the fourth quarter, 2016. 

  Competitive Advantage  

 The Company, through its subsidiaries,
has been conducting business in M xico since March 2000. During this period the Company believes it has structured its subsidiaries
properly and strategically, and during which time the Company has retained key personnel and developed key relationships and support.
The Company believes its experience and accomplishments and relationships in M xico give it a competitive advantage, even
though many competitors may be larger and have more capital resources. 

 DynaM xico retains 100% of the
rights to concessions over the area of the San Jos  de Gracia property and it currently sees no competition for mining on
the lands covered by those concessions. The sale of gold and any bi-products would be subject to global market prices; which prices
fluctuate daily. DynaM xico was successful in selling gold concentrates produced from SJG in prior years, and the Company
expects a competitive market for produced concentrates and/or other mineral products in the future. Actual prices received by DynaMineras
in the sale of concentrates or other products produced from San Jose de Gracia would depend upon these global market prices, less
deductions. 

The Company s operating subsidiaries,
DynaMineras and DynaOperaciones, receive monthly fees for management of the SJG activities and personnel. These fee amounts are
eliminated in consolidation. Other than those intercompany fees, the Company reported revenue of $8,192,230 and $140,548 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

  Capital Requirements  

 The mining industry in general requires
significant capital in order to advance a property from the exploration phase, to development, and to production. These costs remain
a significant barrier to entry for the average company but once in production, there is a ready market for the final products,
In the case of SJG, the final product would be mainly gold, the price of which is determined by global markets, so there is not
a dependence on a customer base. 

  Gold  

  Gold Uses.     
Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics,
dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins
and jewelry. 

  Gold Supply.     A
combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions,
industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available for the
years 2008 through 2015, on average, current mine production has accounted for approximately 64% of the annual gold supply. 

  Gold Price.     The
following table presents the annual high, low and average daily afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past fifteen years on
the London Bullion Market ($/ounce): 

Source: Kitco, Reuters and the London Bullion Market Association 

 On November 15, 2016, the afternoon fixing gold prices were
(a) on the London Bullion Market - $1,227 per ounce; and (b) on the New York Commodity Exchange - $1,228 per ounce. 

  Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance  

 Our business is capital intensive and
requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. We and our subsidiaries
maintain insurance policies against property loss. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly
with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance
policies in connection with a particular event. 

  Environmental Matters  

 Our activities are largely outside the
United States and subject to governmental regulations for the protection of the environment. We conduct our operations in a way
as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations
in all material respects. DynaM xico is involved with maintaining tailings ponds and test mining and pilot production activities
(through DynaMineras) with the oversight of SEMARNAT, the federal environmental agency of M xico. 

Results for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015  

 In the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company was focused on planning, budgeting, and implementing the proceeds from the Golden Post financing into capital
improvements and expansion of the test mining and pilot mill operations at SJG. 

 In the three months ended September
30, 2015, the Company was focused on planning and preparing for the injection of capital pursuant to the capital investment plans,
and completing the financings in order to improve its test mining and milling operations. 

 In the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary DynaMineras, established consistent and profitable test mining and pilot
milling operations at SJG. 

 In the three months ended September
30, 2016 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary DynaMineras, increased the volume of mined tonnage and the amount of
mineralized material processed through the pilot mill facility; and as a result, the amount of gold and silver concentrates produced
and delivered for sale increased. 

 During the nine months ending September
30, 2015, the Company was involved in limited test mining and pilot mill operations. 

 During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the test mining and pilot milling operations yielded the processing of approx. 30,603 tonnes of mineralized material,
the production of approximately 9,990 gross oz. au of gold-silver concentrates, and the receipt of $8,192,230 in revenues for the
period from the production and sale of gold-silver gravity and flotation concentrates. 

 REVENUE. Revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,027,305 and $0, respectively. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $8,192,230 and $140,548 respectively. The Company established consistent test mining and pilot milling operations
in January 2016. 

 PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO SALES. Production
costs related to sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $443,703 and $0, respectively. Production costs
related to sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,308,858 and $45,000, respectively. These are expenses
directly related to the milling, packaging and shipping of gold-silver concentrate products and are comparative with the revenue
figures above. The increase in both periods is a result of consistent test mining and milling operations. 

 MINE OPERATING COSTS. Mine operating
costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $747,403 and $0, respectively. Mine operating costs for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,030,093 and $78,452 respectively. These costs are directly related to the mining
and extraction of mined tonnage to be processed at the pilot mill facility. 

 REFINING AND TREATMENT COSTS. Refining
and Treatment costs are expenses related to separating the gold and silver from the sand and gravel materials and purifying for
sale. Refining and Treatment costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $313,670 and $0, respectively. Refining
and Treatment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,006,330 and $16,548 respectively.

Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and $1,462,981 respectively. The decrease in expense in
2016 was due to the Company s establishing consistent test mining and pilot mill operations in the current nine- month period,
and therefore the Company was no longer in a pre-pilot production phase. 

 PROPERTY HOLDING COSTS. Property holding
costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $110,978 and $178,564, respectively.  Property holding costs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $244,062 and $414,881, respectively. These costs are concessions taxes,

  Non-controlling Interest  

 Under the terms of the Earn In Agreement
(September 1, 2006 to March 15, 2011), Goldgroup Mining Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Goldgroup Resources, Inc. (Goldgroup),
through 2010, had contributed capital to DynaM xico in order to acquire 25% of the outstanding shares (a shareholder interest)
of DynaResource de M xico, S.A. de C.V. (DynaM xico). In March 2011, Goldgroup had contributed a total of $18 M USD
capital to DynaM xico in order to acquire a total of 50% of the outstanding shares (a shareholder interest) of DynaM xico.
From March 2011 through May 2013, Goldgroup owned 50% of the outstanding shares of DynaM xico, and since May 2013 to current
date Goldgroup owns 20% of the outstanding shares of DynaM xico. The applicable portion of the earnings or loss attributable
to Goldgroup is offset in this section. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the portion of the comprehensive
net loss attributable to Goldgroup was $(1,530,200) and $(205,229), respectively. 

  Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

 As of September 30, 2016, we did not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

  Plan of Operation  

 The Plan of operation for the next
twelve months includes the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary DynaMineras, continuing its test mining and pilot milling
operations at SJG, and continuing expansion plans in order to increase the volume of material mined and processed with a resulting
increase projected in the amount of gold concentrates produced and sold. The Company funds its general and administrative expenses
from revenues from production at SJG. The Company s operating subsidiaries, DynaMineras and DynaOperaciones, receive monthly
fees for management of SJG activities and personnel. These amounts are eliminated in consolidation. The Company believes that cash
on hand and revenues from pilot production activities is adequate to fund its ongoing general and administrative expenses through
2016. The Company may seek additional financing for increased operations in the event the Board of Directors determines it is in
the best interest of the Company. 

Capital Expenditures  

 The Company s primary activities
relate to the test mining and pilot mill operations at the SJG property through its 100% owned operating subsidiary, DynaMineras.
DynaMineras is conducting activities at SJG under the terms of the Exploitation Amendment Agreement (the  EAA , or,
 operating agreement ) with DynaM xico. The Company utilized financing proceeds to advance funds to DynaMineras
in order that DynaMineras could: (a) finalize its underground mining plan; (b) make improvements to the pilot mill facility; (c)
acquire mining and transportation equipment; (d) engage a contract miner; and, (e) add integral management and personnel; among
other things. As a result, the Company realized the commencement of contract mining at San Pablo in the fourth quarter 2015, and
a full re-start of pilot mill operations at January 1, 2016. 

  No Known Reserves  

 The SJG property is without known
reserves. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a  reserve  unless a determination has been
made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. 

  Capital Advances to Subsidiaries  

  DynaResource de M xico S.A.
de C.V. ( DynaM xico )

to DynaUSA and DynaMineras by DynaM xico as of September 30, 2016 are as following; 

DynaM xico will be charged an additional $3,050,000 by DynaOperaciones
(amount at September 30, 2016); which amount will be owed by DynaM xico to DynaOperaciones; and,    

As of December 31, 2012, the Company
and DynaMineras agreed with DynaM xico to accrue interest on the total amount receivable until repaid or otherwise retired.
The interest rate to be accrued is agreed to be simple annual interest at the rate quoted by the Bank of M xico. 

  DynaResource Operaciones ( DynaOperaciones )  

 The Company loaned DynaOperaciones $225,000
in 2012, which amount remains payable to the Company as of September 30, 2016. 

  Mineras de DynaResource ( DynaMineras )  

 At September, 30, 2016, DynaMineras owes
$6,700,000 to DynaUSA, as described above.

 All receivables and payables among all
subsidiary companies have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

  Future Advances to DynaMineras and
DynaM xico from DynaUSA  

 DynaUSA expects to make additional advances
to DynaMineras and DynaM xico. Future advances from DynaMineras to DynaM xico will be made under the terms of the
Exploitation Amendment Agreement. Other advances are agreed to be accrued in the same manner as previous receivables, until or
unless otherwise agreed between DynaM xico and DynaUSA Company. 

Advances from Goldgroup Mining Inc.
( Goldgroup ) to DynaM xico  

 In 2014, Goldgroup advanced $111,500
to DynaM xico and in 2013 Goldgroup advanced $120,000 USD to DynaM xico. This total $231,500 is being carried by

  Complaint filed by Goldgroup against
the May 17, 2013 Shareholders Meeting of DynaM xico  

 On February 2, 2014, Goldgroup Resources
Inc. filed a petition with the judge, tenth district Mazatl n, according to record 08/2014, in the ordinary commercial action,
against DynaResource Inc. and DynaResource de M xico, S.A. de CV. Goldgroup complains against the results of the shareholders
meeting of May 17, 2013, and petitions for the nullification of the meeting itself and for the nullification of the additional
shares of the outstanding capital of DynaM xico issued to DynaResource, Inc. in satisfaction of debts owed. 

 DynaResource, Inc. and DynaM xico
expect to vigorously defend all such complaints by Goldgroup, as there exists no legal basis for the complaint against the May
17, 2013 shareholders meeting of DynaM xico. 

  DynaM xico filed Complaint
against Goldgroup  

 On December 9, 2014 DynaM xico
filed an Ordinary commercial lawsuit (Civil Claims), against Goldgroup Mining Inc., Goldgroup Resources Inc. ( Goldgroup ,
a shareholder of DynaM xico); and, against the American Arbitration Association ( AAA  based at the Thirty Sixth
Civil Court in the Federal District of M xico, under file 1120 number / 2014 ( the DynaM xico Trial ).
The DynaM xico Trial seeks to terminate the arbitration proceedings as DynaM xico believes there is no legal basis
for arbitration, and the DynaM xico Trial requests substantial damages are awarded DynaM xico from and against Goldgroup
for: 

a)    wrongfully using and disseminating confidential information and data
belonging to DynaM xico;    

b)    asserting that Goldgroup owns any interest in the San Jose de Gracia
Project in northern Sinaloa, M xico ( SJG Project ), rather than accurately disclosing that Goldgroup owns a
common shares equity interest (shareholder s interest) in DynaM xico;     

c)    improperly disclosing the percentage of common shares equity interest
(shareholder s interest) owned by Goldgroup in DynaM xico;     

d)    improperly disclosing or implying that Goldgroup is the operator
of the San Jose de Gracia Project;    

e)    attempting to delay, stop, or otherwise impair the financing of,
and further development of, the SJG Project;     

f)    making numerous threats against DynaM xico management and
officers;     

g)    failing to properly disclose that broad powers of attorney for acting
on behalf of DynaM xico are held by an individual not affiliated with Goldgroup.    

 DynaM xico believes the filing
of the DynaM xico Trial to be necessary in order to protect the property and interests of DynaM xico, and in order
to seek fair retribution and substantial damage amounts caused by Goldgroup against DynaM xico and the SJG Project.

from Goldgroup Resources, Inc. (the  Goldgroup Damages ) by virtue of a Sentencia Definitiva (the  Definitive
Sentence ) issued by the Thirty Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice of the Federal District of M xico
(Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal), File number 1120/2014. The Definitive Sentence included the considerations
and resolutions by the Court, and additional Resolutions were also ordered in favor of DynaM xico (together the Goldgroup
Damages and the additional Resolutions are referred to as, the  Oct. 5, 2015 Resolution ).

Inc., which currently holds 80% of the outstanding share capital of DynaM xico. A concise translation to English of the
Oct. 5, 2015 Resolution issued in Spanish (the resolution portion of the Definitive Sentence) is set forth below: 

  FIRST:  The action and litigation
based on commercial law filed by DynaM xico is valid and enforceable, and where Goldgroup and the American Arbitration Association
were found to be in default, was proper.

Mining Project. 

  THIRD:   Goldgroup is condemned
and ordered to pay to DynaM xico the amount of USD $20,000,000 (Twenty Million Dollars) in damages caused by Goldgroup to
DynaM xico, deriving from its breach of obligations in refraining from claiming direct ownership of 50% of the San Jose
de Gracia Mining Project; which amount should be paid within five days upon execution of this order and resolution. 

  FOURTH:  Goldgroup is condemned
and ordered to pay to DynaM xico the amount of USD $28,280,808.34 (Twenty Eight Million Two Hundred and Eighty Thousand
Eight Hundred and Eight and 34/100 Dollars), for breach of its corporate duty and covenants with regards to the San Jose de Gracia
mining project, as a result of depriving profits from DynaM xico which DynaM xico could have earned for the sale
of gold produced and extracted during the years 2013 and 2014; amounts that should be paid within five days upon execution of this
order and resolution. 

  FIFTH:  Goldgroup is condemned
and ordered to pay losses and damages to DynaM xico, which Goldgroup continues to cause, until full payment of the above-mentioned
amounts has been made, which damages and losses shall be calculated by an expert opinion in a corresponding legal procedure related
to this litigation. 

  SIXTH:  Pursuant to Article
1424 of the Commercial Code of M xico, the arbitration provision established under clause 8.16 of the Earn In/Option Agreement,
dated as of September 1, 2006, is ineffective and impossible to execute. 

  SEVENTH:  This Court declares
that any controversy arising from the Earn In/Option Agreement must be brought and resolved under Mexican Law and by competent
Mexican Courts with proper jurisdiction, in recognition of the waiver and exclusion of the arbitration clause (contained in the
Earn In/Option Agreement) by both parties. 

  EIGHT:  This Court declares
that the American Arbitration Association must abstain from hearing arbitration procedure number 50 501 T 00226 14, or any other
ongoing and/or future arbitration proceeding already filed or that may be filed by the co-defendant Goldgroup against DynaResource. 

  NINTH:  This Court declares
that the American Arbitration Association does not have jurisdiction to hear any conflict and/or interpretation arising from the
Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006. 

  TENTH:  This Court declares,
that the American Arbitration Association does not have jurisdiction to hear disputes arising between shareholders of DynaM xico,
which disputes do not arise directly and immediately from the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006. 

  ELEVENTH:  This Court declares,
that the American Arbitration Association does not have jurisdiction to hear any matters where Koy Wilber Diepholz, who is the
President of the Board of Directors of DynaM xico, and has been personally sued in relation to the arbitration clause established
under clause 8.16 of the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006, since he signed the mentioned instrument in representation
of the Company and not in his personal capacity. 

  TWELFTH:  The expenses and
costs associated with these proceedings are hereby waived. 

  THIRTEENTH:  LET IT SO BE
PUBLISHED. A Copy of this Order and Sentence shall be found in the corresponding record. 

  ORDERED, adjudged and decreed by the
Thirty Sixth Civil Judge of the Superior Court of the Federal District, Mr. JULIO GABRIEL IGLESIAS GOMEZ.  

 The October 5, 2015 Resolution constitutes
a public record which may be reviewed through the Courts in M xico City. 

 The Company believes that no material
adverse change will occur as a result of the legal actions taken, and the Company further believes that there is little to no potential
for the assessment of a material monetary judgment against the Company for legal actions it has filed in M xico. For purposes
of confidentiality, the Company does not provide more specific disclosure in this Form 10-Q. 

DynaM xico Statements of Fact  

 In recent years, Goldgroup has continuously
and consistently misrepresented its interest, ownership, and position related to DynaM xico and the SJG Project. DynaM xico
does herein state and represent the following: 

1.  At no time has Goldgroup owned any interest in the SJG Project; rather its only ownership interests
have been earned under agreement as a common shares equity interest (shareholder s interest) of DynaM xico;   

2.  Goldgroup currently owns 20% of the outstanding share capital of DynaM xico;   

3.  Goldgroup does not currently own 50% of the outstanding share capital of DynaM xico as Goldgroup
has recently stated in numerous public disclosures and public filings;   

4.  Goldgroup s 20% ownership of DynaM xico was ordered to be maintained and represented
as such (the  status quo ) by a Mexican Judge overseeing certain claims by Goldgroup;   

5.  At no time during its involvement as a common shares equity interest holder (shareholder) of DynaM xico,
has Goldgroup been an operator at the SJG Project;   

6.  Since the earning of its shareholder s interest in DynaM xico (March, 2011), Goldgroup
has continuously refused to contribute funds to the ongoing maintenance, advance, and further development of the SJG Project;   

7.  Consistently and continuously since March 2011, Goldgroup has sought and threatened to stop, delay,
or otherwise impair the financing, maintenance, advance and further development of the SJG Project.   

 The Company believes that no material
adverse change will occur as a result of the actions taken, and the Company further believes that there is little to no potential
for the assessment of a material monetary judgment against the Company for legal actions it has filed in M xico. For purposes
of confidentiality, the Company does not provide more specific disclosure in this Form 10-Q.
