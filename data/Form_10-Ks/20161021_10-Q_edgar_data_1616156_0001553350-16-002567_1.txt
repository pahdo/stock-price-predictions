  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  August 31, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
 Future World Group, Inc. was incorporated   in the state of Nevada on September 10, 2013 as Betafox Corp., with the initial intent to manufacture and sell color candles. On April 26, 2015, Giorgos Kallides (the  Seller ), entered into an Agreement for the Purchase of Common Stock (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with Future Continental Limited, ( Purchaser ) pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to Purchaser, six million (6,000,000) shares of common stock of the Company (the  Shares ) owned by the Seller, constituting approximately 73.8% of the Company s 8,130,000 issued and outstanding common shares, for $340,000. The sale was consummated on May 11, 2015. As a result of the transfer of the shares, there was a change of control of the Company. The Company s corporate office is located in Walnut, California. 
   
 On August 6, 2016 the Company signed Statements of Work (SOWs ) with Intellectsoft LLC, an unaffiliated company, to perform services for the development and administration of websites to support a mobile app which will enable consumers to purchase goods with Future World Group vouchers, and merchants will be able to sell their goods directly to the users, using this platform.   
   
 The SOWs provide that after this mobile app has been developed, Intellectsoft LLC will then proceed to phase 2, which is intended to be the development of this app for trade centers.  
   
 In total, FWG has agreed to pay Intellectsoft LLC $1,183,000 during the course of development of these apps .  As of the date of this Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has paid $733,001 to Intellectsoft LLC. 
   
 In addition to the SOWs with Intellectsoft, between August 20, 2016 and September 27, 2016, the registrant signed five SOWs with hedgehog lab, an unaffiliated UK-based company which is also unaffiliated with Intellectsoft to provide additional services to the registrant in connection with the app being developed.  The objective of these services, to be completed in two phases, includes (1) creating a white labelled version of Future World which can be packaged up in a way by which small co-operatives of merchants can create their own eco systems of product selling and loyalty point trading, using  Future Vouchers  (2) taking the current version of the app, improving the identified pain points and providing versions in English and Chinese, to allow the app to be used in Asia, Europe and North America, by the merchants and customers in as short a time as possible; (3) having a loyalty point trading platform visualized within the new iOS and Android applications, as well as defining the distribution of future vouchers and loyalty points; and (4) the creation of a prototype of a 3D globe system, visualizing the potential for the globalization of the app into cities. 
   
 In total, FWG has agreed to pay hedgehog lab 950,000 GBP, which is $1,216,000 during the course of development of these apps .  As of the date of this Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has paid $814,614 to hedgehog lab.  
   
 As a result of the Company signing these SOWs and paying the amounts set forth above, the Company is executing its business plan, and is therefore no longer a  shell,  as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 
   
  NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company has no revenues to date and an accumulated deficit of $761,249. The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.   
   
 Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Basis of presentation  
 The Company s unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending May 31, 2017. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. 
   
 ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments,  defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. 
   
 The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows: 

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
   
 Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; 
   
 Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
   
  NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY LOANS  
   
 As of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company owed the Lei Pei, the CEO $103,412 and $53,913, respectively. All funds were used for professional fees and other general operating purposes. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 
   
 As of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company owed another company owned by the CEO $70,740 and $70,740, respectively. The funds were used for professional fees and other general operating purposes. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.

Convertible Promissory Note   
 On each of August 1, 2016 and August 3, 2016, Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd., a California corporation ( Sky Rover ) which is 100% owned by Lei Pei, the CEO and principal shareholder, loaned $500,000 to the Company (total of $1,000,000). Sky Rover was issued an unsecured, 5%, convertible promissory note which is due on August 1, 2019, and is convertible into the common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). At the option of the Company, the interest may also be paid by issuing restricted shares of common stock, at the same conversion price per share. As of August 31, 2016 there is $4,167 of interest accrued on the loan. 
   
 If and when Sky Rover converts the entire $1,000,000 Note at the present conversion price of $.04 per share, Sky Rover would be issued 25,000,000 restricted shares of common stock.  Those shares, plus the 6,000,000 shares Mr. Pei currently owns, would give him beneficial ownership of 31,000,000 of the 33,130,000 then-issued and outstanding shares (assuming that no other shares are issued before conversion), which would be approximately 93.6% of the then-outstanding shares.   
   
  NOTE 5   PREFERRED STOCK  
   
 The Company has designated preferred stock consisting of 50,000,000 shares, par value $.001 per share. The voting powers, conversion features, if any, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and other rights of the preferred stock shall be prescribed by resolution of the Board of Directors at the time a specific series of preferred stock is designated. 
   
      NOTE 6   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  
   
 In accordance with SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10) management has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were available to be issued, October 10, 2016 and through the date of the filing, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements other than the following: 
   
 On September 27, 2016, Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd., a California corporation ( Sky Rover ) which is 100% owned by Lei Pei, the CEO and principal shareholder, loaned $2,000,000 to the Company. Sky Rover was issued an unsecured, 5%, convertible promissory note which is due on September 27, 2019, and is convertible into the common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). 
   
 Effective September 30, 2016, the Company increased its authorized shares to 300,000,000, consisting of 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report  . Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
   
     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
   
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception (September 10, 2013) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $761,249 as of August 31, 2016. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  
   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company acquiring profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. New management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties, until we acquire an ongoing business, as to which there is no assurance.  
   
   Results of Operations for the Three Months ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months ended August 31, 2015   
   
   Operating Expenses   
 During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred total operating expenses of $643,393 compared to $26,261 incurred during the three months ended August 31, 2015. During the current period professional fees decreased $5,577 to $19,850 from $25,427 in the prior period. Professional fees consist of legal, accounting and audit fees. Also, in the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred $621,705 for development and administration of websites to support our mobile app. There was no such expense in the prior period. 
   
   Net Loss   
 Our net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was $647,560, compared to a net loss of $26,261 for the prior period ended August 31, 2015. The increase in net loss is a direct result of the increase in development fees. 
   
   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $643,393. For the same period ended August 31, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $25,511. 
   
   Cash Flows from Investing Activities   
 We neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the periods ended August 31, 2016 or August 31, 2015.  
   
   Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
 For the three months ended August 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $1,049,500 received by way of related party loans. For the three months ended August 31 2015, net cash from financing activities was $25,489, received by way of a loan from our former sole officer, director and principal shareholder. 

10 

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 Unless and until we acquire an ongoing business ,  or until our transactions with Intellectsoft begins to generate positive cash flow, as to which there is no assurance, we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through related party loans and/or further issuances of securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to meet our working capital requirement from either possible source. 
   
 We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, and we might be unable to continue in business.   
   
  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have the material commitments, in accordance with our SOWs with Intellectsoft and Hedgehog, that are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. 

PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT  
   
 We do not have any agreements at this time, to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.  
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
  GOING CONCERN  
   
 The independent auditors' report accompanying our May 31, 2016 and 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception (September 10, 2013), resulting in an accumulated deficit of $761,249 as of August 31, 2016, and further losses are anticipated unless and until we acquire an ongoing business, as to which there is no assurance. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  
   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company acquiring profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations when they come due. New management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties and/or the private placement of common stock. There is no assurance that funds will be available from either possible source of financing operations. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
   
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

11 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
   
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
   
  The term  disclosure controls and procedures  (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e)) refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods.  Disclosure controls and procedures  include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
  The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer noted the deficiencies in internal controls identified in this Item 4. Accordingly, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, such controls and procedures were not effective.  
     
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 using the criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  
     
  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.  

1. 
        We do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the single-member Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

2. 
        Lack of segregation of duties We currently have no employees other than our CEO and CFO the same person.  Therefore, all accounting information is currently reviewed only by one person.  

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls.  
     
  As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.  
     
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
