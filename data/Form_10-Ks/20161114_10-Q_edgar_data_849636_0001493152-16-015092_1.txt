Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the  Company ) contains certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor created thereby. These might include statements
regarding the Company s financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, and
assumptions and predictions about research and development efforts, including, but not limited to, preclinical and clinical research
design, execution, timing, costs and results, future product demand, supply, manufacturing, costs, marketing and pricing factors
are all forward-looking statements.  

In
some cases, forward-looking statements may be identified by words including  anticipates,   believes, 
 intends,   estimates,   expects,   plans,  and similar expressions include, but
are not limited to, statements regarding (i) future research plans, expenditures and results, (ii) potential collaborative arrangements,
(iii) the potential utility of the Company s proposed products, and (iv) the need for, and availability of, additional financing.  

The
forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions regarding the Company s business and technology, which involve
judgments with respect to, among other things, future scientific, economic and competitive conditions, and future business decisions,
all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the Company s control. Although
the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
information included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
other person that the Company s objectives or plans will be achieved.  

Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, regulatory policies or changes thereto, available
cash, research and development results, competition from other similar businesses, and market and general economic factors. This
discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) and notes thereto included
in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, including the section entitled  Item 1A. Risk Factors.  The Company does not intend to update or revise
any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.

NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   (Unaudited)   

Three
Months and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

1.
Organization and Basis of Presentation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements of RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( RespireRx ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Pier Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Pier ) (collectively referred to herein as the  Company,  unless the context
indicates otherwise), at September 30, 2016 and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) have been made that are necessary to present
fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the results of its consolidated operations
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and its consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. Consolidated operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for a full fiscal year. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements at such date.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and other information included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.  

Reverse
Stock Split    

On
August 16, 2016, at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s
Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to effect, at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, a three
hundred twenty five-to-one (325 to 1) reverse stock split of all of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, and (ii) to set the number of the Company s authorized shares of stock at 70,000,000 shares,
consisting of 65,000,000 shares designated as common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares designated as preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share. On September 1, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Second
Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the approved amendment.  

Pursuant
to the amendment, an aggregate of 191.068 fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were not issued, but are being
paid out in cash (without interest or deduction) in an amount equal to the number of shares exchanged into such fractional share
multiplied by the average closing trading price of the Company s common stock on the OTCQB for the five trading days immediately
before the Certificate of Amendment effecting the reverse stock split was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State ($6.7899
per share, on a post reverse stock split basis) for a total of $1,298.  

All
share and per share amounts with respect to common stock presented herein have been retroactively restated to reflect the 325
to 1 reverse stock split as if it had been effected on the first day of the earliest period presented. Certain share amounts have
been rounded to whole shares in the process of recording the effect of the reverse stock split.  

2.
Business   

RespireRx
was formed in 1987 under the name Cortex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to engage in the discovery, development and commercialization of
innovative pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. On December 16, 2015, the Company filed
a Certificate of Amendment to its Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
to amend the Company s Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change the name of the Company from Cortex Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. to RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc.  

Since
its formation in 1987, RespireRx has been engaged in the research and clinical development of a class of proprietary compounds
known as ampakines, which act to enhance the actions of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate at AMPA glutamate receptors.
Several ampakines, in both oral and injectable form, are being developed by the Company for the treatment of a variety of breathing
disorders. In clinical studies, select ampakines have shown preliminary efficacy in central sleep apnea and in the control of
respiratory depression produced by opioids, without altering their analgesic effects. In animal models of orphan disorders, such
as Pompe Disease, spinal cord damage and perinatal respiratory distress, it has been demonstrated that certain ampakines improve
breathing function. The Company s compounds belong to a new class of ampakines that do not display the undesirable side
effects previously reported in animal models of earlier generations.  

The
Company owns patents and patent applications, or the rights thereto, for certain families of chemical compounds, including ampakines,
which claim the chemical structures and their use in the treatment of various disorders. These patents cover, among other compounds,
the Company s lead ampakines CX1739 and CX1942, and extend through at least 2028.  

In
2011, RespireRx conducted a re-evaluation of its strategic focus and determined that clinical development in the area of respiratory
disorders, particularly sleep apnea and drug-induced respiratory depression, provided the most cost-effective opportunities for
potential rapid development and commercialization of RespireRx s compounds. Accordingly, RespireRx narrowed its clinical
focus at that time and sidelined other avenues of scientific inquiry. This re-evaluation provided the impetus for RespireRx s
acquisition of Pier in August 2012, as described below.  

The
Company has continued to implement this strategic focus, notwithstanding a change in management in March 2013, and has continued
its efforts to obtain the capital necessary to fund the clinical activities. As a result of the Company s scientific discoveries
and the acquisition of strategic, exclusive license agreements, management believes that the Company is now a leader in developing
drugs for respiratory disorders, particularly sleep apneas and drug-induced respiratory depression.  

On
May 8, 2007, RespireRx entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting RespireRx
exclusive rights to method of treatment patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment
of various respiratory disorders. These patents, along with RespireRx s own patents claiming chemical structures, comprise
RespireRx s principal intellectual property supporting RespireRx s research and clinical development program in the
use of ampakines for the treatment of respiratory disorders. RespireRx has completed pre-clinical studies indicating that several
of its ampakines, including CX717, CX1739 and CX1942, were efficacious in treating drug induced respiratory depression caused
by opioids or certain anesthetics without offsetting the analgesic effects of the opioids or the anesthetic effects of the anesthetics.
In two clinical Phase 2 studies, one of which was published in a peer-reviewed journal, CX717, a predecessor compound to CX1739
and CX1942, antagonized the respiratory depression produced by fentanyl, a potent narcotic, without affecting the analgesia produced
by this drug. In addition, RespireRx has conducted a Phase 2A clinical study in which patients with sleep apnea were administered
CX1739, RespireRx s lead clinical compound. The results suggested that CX1739 might have use as a treatment for central
sleep apnea ( CSA ) and mixed sleep apnea, but not obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ).  

In
order to expand RespireRx s respiratory disorders program, RespireRx acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity
securities of Pier effective August 10, 2012 pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. Pier was formed in June 2007 (under
the name SteadySleep Rx Co.) as a clinical stage pharmaceutical company to develop a pharmacologic treatment for OSA and had been
engaged in research and clinical development activities.  

Prior
to the merger, Pier conducted a 21 day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 2 clinical study in
22 patients with OSA, in which dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index, the primary
therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well tolerated.  

Through
the merger, RespireRx gained access to an Exclusive License Agreement (as amended, the  2007 License Agreement ) that
Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The 2007 License Agreement covered certain patents
and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids,
of which dronabinol is a specific example, for the treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea). Dronabinol
is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as  9-THC ( 9-tetrahydrocannabinol).
Pier s business plan was to determine whether dronabinol would significantly improve subjective and objective clinical measures
in patients with OSA. In addition, Pier intended to evaluate the feasibility and comparative efficacy of a proprietary formulation
of dronabinol.  

Dronabinol
is a Schedule III, controlled generic drug with a relatively low abuse potential that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(the  FDA ) for the treatment of AIDS-related anorexia and chemotherapy-induced emesis. The use of dronabinol for
the treatment of OSA is a novel indication for an already approved drug and, as such, the Company believes that it would only
require approval by the FDA of a 505(b)(2) application, as opposed to the submission and approval of a full new drug application.  

The
2007 License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013, due to the Company s failure to make a required payment.
Subsequently, current management opened negotiations with the University of Illinois, and as a result, the Company entered into
a new license agreement (the  2014 License Agreement ) with the University of Illinois on June 27, 2014, the material
terms of which were similar to the previous 2007 License Agreement.  

Similar
to the 2007 License Agreement, the 2014 License Agreement grants the Company, among other provisions, exclusive rights: (i) to
practice certain patents and patent applications, as defined in the 2014 License Agreement, that are held by the University of
Illinois; (ii) to identify, develop, make, have made, import, export, lease, sell, have sold or offer for sale any related licensed
products; and (iii) to grant sub-licenses of the rights granted in the 2014 License Agreement, subject to the provisions of the
2014 License Agreement. The Company is required under the 2014 License Agreement, among other terms and conditions, to pay the
University of Illinois a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain milestone payments.  

Going
Concern    

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred
net losses of $7,804,002 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5,961,892 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015,
and had negative operating cash flows of $1,212,331 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,296,100 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015. The Company also had a stockholders  deficiency of $4,846,319 at September 30, 2016, and expects
to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has
concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2015, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is currently, and has for some time, been in significant financial distress. It has limited cash resources and current
assets and has no ongoing source of sustainable revenue. Management is continuing to address various aspects of the Company s
operations and obligations, including, without limitation, debt obligations, financing requirements, intellectual property, licensing
agreements, legal and patent matters and regulatory compliance, and has continued to raise new debt and equity capital to fund
the Company s business activities from both related and unrelated parties, as described at Notes 4 and 6.  

The
Company is continuing efforts to raise additional capital in order to pay its liabilities, fund its business activities and underwrite
its research and development programs. The Company regularly evaluates various measures to satisfy the Company s liquidity
needs, including the development of agreements with collaborative partners and, when necessary, the exchange or restructuring
of the Company s outstanding securities. As a result of the Company s current financial situation, the Company has
limited access to external sources of debt and equity financing and has recently utilized short-term borrowings from its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Scientific Officer to fund operations, although there can be no assurances that such borrowings
will continue to be available. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing
in the amounts necessary to fund its operating and debt service requirements. If the Company is unable to access sufficient cash
resources on a timely basis, the Company may be forced to reduce or suspend operations indefinitely or to discontinue operations
entirely and liquidate.  

3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ( GAAP ) and include the financial statements of RespireRx and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pier. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates
and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
include, among other things, accounting for potential liabilities and the assumptions used in valuing stock-based compensation
issued for services. Actual amounts may differ from those estimates.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk    

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents.
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing its cash with high quality financial institutions. The Company s
cash balances may periodically exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced a loss in such accounts to date.  

Cash
Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with maturities of less than three months when acquired to be cash
equivalents.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
authoritative guidance with respect to fair value established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three levels, and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified
and disclosed in one of three categories, as presented below. Disclosure as to transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2, and activity
in Level 3 fair value measurements, is also required.  

Level
1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for an identical asset or liability that the Company has the ability
to access as of the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active-exchange traded
securities and exchange-based derivatives.  

Level
2. Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly
observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include
fixed income securities, non-exchange based derivatives, mutual funds, and fair-value hedges.  

Level
3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded, non-exchange-based
derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured using present value pricing models.  

The
Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels,
the Company performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.  

The
carrying amount of financial instruments (consisting of cash, cash equivalents, advances on research grant and accounts payable
and accrued expenses) is considered by the Company to be representative of the respective fair values of these instruments due
to the short-term nature of those instruments. With respect to the note payable to SY Corporation and the convertible notes payable,
management does not believe that the credit markets have materially changed for these types of borrowings since the original borrowing
date.  

Deferred
Financing Costs    

Costs
incurred in connection with ongoing debt and equity financings, including legal fees, are deferred until the related financing
is either completed or abandoned.  

Costs
related to abandoned debt or equity financings are charged to operations in the period of abandonment. Costs related to completed
debt financings are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability (see  Capitalized
Financing Costs  below). Costs related to completed equity financings are charged directly to additional paid-in capital.  

Capitalized
Financing Costs    

Through
December 31, 2015, costs related to completed debt financings were capitalized on the balance sheet and amortized over the term
of the related debt agreements. Amortization of these costs was calculated on the straight-line basis, which approximated the
effective interest method, and was charged to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  

Pursuant
to Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 (ASU 2015-03), Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), effective
January 1, 2016, the Company is required to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability in its consolidated balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation for debt discounts.
The Company is required to apply the new accounting guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual
period presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance, and is required to comply with
the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the
change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively
adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (i.e., the debt issuance cost asset and the debt
liability).  

As
the Company did not have any capitalized financing costs on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 or at September
30, 2016, the implementation of ASU 2015-03 did not have any impact on the Company s financial statements as presented herein.  

Series
G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock    

The
shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock (including accrued dividends) issued in 2014 were mandatorily convertible
into common stock at a fixed conversion rate on April 17, 2016 (if not converted earlier) and provided no right to receive a cash
payment. Additionally, the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock included no participatory or reset rights, or other protections
(other than normal anti-dilution rights) based on subsequent events, including equity transactions. Accordingly, the Company determined
to categorize the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock in stockholders  equity (deficiency), as there were no derivatives
embedded in such security that would require identification, bifurcation and valuation. The Company did not issue any warrants
to investors in conjunction with the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock financing.  

On
March 18, 2014 and April 17, 2014, the Company issued 753.22 shares and 175.28 shares, respectively, of Series G 1.5% Convertible
Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1,000 per share. Each share of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock had a stated
value of $1,000 per share and was convertible into shares of common stock at a fixed price of $1.0725 per share of common stock.
On March 18, 2014 and April 17, 2014, the per share fair value of the common stock into which the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred
Stock was convertible, determined by reference to the closing market prices of the Company s common stock on such closing
dates, was $13.0000 per share and $11.3100 per share, respectively, which was greater than the effective purchase price of such
common shares of $1.0725 per share.  

The
Company accounted for the beneficial conversion features in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
470-20, Accounting for Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company calculated a deemed dividend on the Series G 1.5% Convertible
Preferred Stock of $8,376,719 in March 2014 and $1,673,127 in April 2014, which equaled the amount by which the estimated fair
value of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the issued Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock exceeded the proceeds
from such issuances. The deemed dividend on the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock was amortized on the straight-line basis
from the respective issuance dates through the earliest conversion date of June 16, 2014, in accordance with ASC 470-20. The difference
between the amortization of the deemed dividend calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was
not material.  

Dr.
Arnold S. Lippa, Ph.D., the Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer at that time, purchased
250 shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock for $250,000, representing 33.2% of the 753.22 shares of Series G 1.5%
Convertible Preferred Stock sold in the initial closing of such financing on March 18, 2014. The second and final closing of the
financing consisted entirely of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock sold to unaffiliated investors. Accordingly, Dr. Lippa
purchased 26.9% of the entire amount of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock sold in the financing. Dr. Lippa had been an
officer and director of the Company for approximately one year when he purchased the 250 shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred
Stock, and his investment, which was only a portion of the first closing, was made on the same terms and conditions as those provided
to the other unaffiliated investors who made up the majority of the financing. Dr. Lippa did not control, directly or indirectly,
10% or more of the Company s voting equity securities at the time of his investment. The proportionate share of the deemed
dividend attributable to Dr. Lippa s investment in the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock in March 2014 was $2,780,303.
On April 18, 2014, the shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock originally purchased by Dr. Lippa were transferred
to the Arnold Lippa Family Trust of 2007. On April 15, 2015, these shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, plus accrued
dividends of $4,120, were converted into 236,942 shares of common stock.  

Convertible
Notes Payable    

Original
Issuance of Notes and Warrants    

The
convertible notes sold to investors in 2014 and 2015 had a fixed interest rate of 10% per annum and are convertible into common
stock at a fixed price of $11.3750 per share. The convertible notes have no reset rights or other protections based on subsequent
equity transactions, equity-linked transactions or other events. The warrants issued in connection with the sale of the convertible
notes were exercisable at a fixed price of $11.3750 per share, provided no right to receive a cash payment, and included no reset
rights or other protections based on subsequent equity transactions, equity-linked transactions or other events. The Company determined
that there were no embedded derivatives to be identified, bifurcated and valued in connection with this financing.  

On
November 5, 2014, the Company sold an aggregate principal amount of $238,500 of its convertible notes payable due September 15,
2015, which were subject to extension to September 15, 2016, at the option of the Company, subject to the issuance of additional
warrants, and warrants to purchase shares of common stock exercisable into a fixed number of shares of common stock of the Company
calculated as the principal amount of each convertible note divided by $11.3750 (reflecting 100% warrant coverage). The warrants
did not have any cashless exercise provisions and, when issued, were exercisable through September 30, 2015 at a fixed price of
$11.3750 per share. The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes payable and the exercise of the warrants
were not subject to any registration rights.  

On
December 9, 2014, December 31, 2014, and February 2, 2015, the Company sold an additional $46,000, $85,000 and $210,000, respectively,
of principal amount of the convertible notes and warrants to various accredited investors. The Company terminated this financing,
which had generated aggregate gross proceeds of $579,500, and in connection with which the Company had issued 50,945 warrants,
effective February 18, 2015. The convertible notes sold to investors in 2014 and 2015 had a fixed interest rate of 10% per annum
and are convertible into common stock at a fixed price of $11.3750 per share. The convertible notes have no reset rights or other
protections based on subsequent equity transactions, equity-linked transactions or other events. The warrants issued in connection
with the sale of the convertible notes were exercisable at a fixed price of $11.3750 per share, provided no right to receive a
cash payment, and included no reset rights or other protections based on subsequent equity transactions, equity-linked transactions
or other events. The Company determined that there are no embedded derivatives to be identified, bifurcated and valued in connection
with this financing.  

The
closing market prices of the Company s common stock on the transaction closing dates of November 5, 2014, December 9, 2014,
December 31, 2014 and February 2, 2015 were $17.0300 per share, $13.3575 per share, $14.6575 per share and $13.9750 per share,
respectively, as compared to the fixed conversion price of the convertible notes and the fixed exercise price of the warrants
of $11.3750 per share. Accordingly, the Company has accounted for the beneficial conversion features with respect to the sale
of the convertible notes and the issuance of the warrants in accordance with ASC 470-20, Accounting for Debt with Conversion and
Other Options.  

The
Company considered the face value of the convertible notes to be representative of their fair value. The Company determined the
fair value of the warrants based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The relative fair value method generated respective
fair values for each of the convertible notes and the warrants of approximately 50% for the convertible notes and approximately
50% for the warrants sold with the convertible notes. Once these values were determined, the fair value of the warrants of $289,106
and the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature of $290,394 (which were calculated based on the effective conversion price)
were recorded as a reduction to the face value of the promissory note obligation. As a result, this aggregate debt discount reduced
the carrying value of the convertible notes to zero at each issuance date. The excess amount generated from this calculation was
not recorded, as the carrying value of a promissory note cannot be reduced below zero. The aggregate debt discount was amortized
as interest expense over the original term of the promissory notes. The difference between the amortization of the debt discount
calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

The
cash fees paid to placement agents and for legal costs incurred from November 5, 2014 through February 2, 2015 with respect to
this financing were deferred and capitalized as deferred offering costs and were amortized to interest expense over the original
term of the convertible notes through September 15, 2015 on the straight-line method. The placement agent warrants were considered
as an additional cost of the offering and were included in deferred offering costs at fair value. The difference between the amortization
of the deferred offering costs calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

Extension
of Notes and Original Warrants, and Issuance of New Warrants    

On
August 13, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes, the Company elected to extend the maturity date of the convertible
notes to September 15, 2016. As a consequence of this election, under the terms of the convertible notes, the Company was required
to issue to note holders 27,396 additional warrants (the  New Warrants ) that were exercisable through September 15,
2016. As set forth in the convertible notes, the New Warrants were exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the
Company calculated as the principal amount of the convertible notes (an aggregate amount of $579,500), plus any accrued and unpaid
interest (an aggregate amount of $43,758), multiplied by 50%, and then divided by $11.3750. The New Warrants otherwise had terms
substantially similar to the 50,945 original warrants issued to the investors. In connection with the extension of the maturity
date of the convertible notes, the Board of Directors of the Company also determined to extend the termination date of the 50,945
original warrants to September 15, 2016, so that they were coterminous with the new maturity date of the convertible notes.  

The
Company reviewed the guidance in ASC 405-20, Extinguishment of Liabilities, and determined that the convertible notes had not
been extinguished. The Company therefore concluded that the guidance in ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, should
be applied, which states that if the exchange or modification is not to be accounted for in the same manner as a debt extinguishment,
then the fees shall be associated with the replacement or modified debt instrument and, along with any existing unamortized premium
or discount, amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the replacement or modified debt instrument
using the interest method.  

The
Company deferred the debt modification costs related to the modification of the convertible notes and the issuance of the New
Warrants (consisting of the fair value of the New Warrants) over the remaining term of the extended notes. The Company accounted
for such costs as a discount to the convertible notes and amortized such costs to interest expense over the extended term of the
convertible notes on the straight-line method. The difference between the amortization of these costs calculated based on the
straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

The
Company deferred the debt modification costs related to the extension of the original warrants (consisting of the fair value of
the extension of the original warrants) over the remaining term of the extended convertible notes. The Company accounted for such
costs as a discount to the convertible notes and amortized such costs to interest expense over the extended term of the convertible
notes on the straight-line method. The difference between the amortization of these costs calculated based on the straight-line
method and the effective yield method was not material.  

The
closing market price of the Company s common stock on the extension date of September 15, 2015 was $10.0750 per share, as
compared to the fixed conversion price of the convertible notes and the fixed exercise price of both the original warrants and
the New Warrants of $10.0750 per share. The Company accounted for the beneficial conversion features with respect to the extension
of the convertible notes and the extension of the original warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants in accordance with ASC
470-20, Accounting for Debt with Conversion and Other Options.  

The
Company considered the face value of the convertible notes, plus the accrued interest thereon, to be representative of their fair
value. The Company determined the fair value of the 27,396 New Warrants and the fair value of extending the 50,945 original warrants
based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The relative fair value method generated respective fair values for each of the
convertible notes, including accrued interest, and the New Warrants and extension of the original warrants, of approximately 55%
for the convertible notes, including accrued interest, and approximately 45% for the New Warrants and extension of the original
warrants. Once these values were determined, the fair value of the New Warrants and extension of the original warrants of $277,918
and the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature of $206,689 (which were calculated based on the effective conversion price)
were recorded as a reduction to the face value of the promissory note obligation. The aggregate debt discount was amortized as
interest expense over the extended term of the promissory notes. The difference between the amortization of the debt discount
calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

Note
Exchange Agreements    

During
April and May 2016, the Company entered into Note Exchange Agreements with certain note holders, including one non-officer/director
affiliate, as described below, representing an aggregate of $303,500 of principal amount of the convertible notes (out of a total
of $579,500 of original principal amount of the convertible notes payable). The Note Exchange Agreements were substantially similar,
and provided for the note holders to exchange their notes, original warrants and New Warrants (collectively, the  Exchanged
Securities ), plus cash, in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock. In the aggregate, $344,483 of principal
amount (which included accrued interest of $40,983) of the convertible notes, original warrants to purchase 26,681 shares of the
Company s common stock and New Warrants to purchase 14,259 shares of the Company s common stock, plus an aggregate
of $232,846 in cash, were exchanged for 101,508 shares of the Company s common stock, with a total market value of $631,023
(average $6.2075 per share), which resulted in a credit to total stockholders  deficiency of $577,329. All of the Exchanged
Securities were cancelled as a result of the respective exchange transactions.  

Among
the executed Note Exchange Agreements, the Company entered into one Note Exchange Agreement with a non-officer/director affiliate
effective May 4, 2016 (the financial information with respect thereto is included in the summary paragraph presented above), pursuant
to which this affiliate exchanged $28,498 of principal amount (which included accrued interest of $3,498) of the convertible notes,
original warrants to purchase 2,198 shares of the Company s common stock and New Warrants to purchase 1,178 shares of the
Company s common stock, plus $19,200 in cash, in return for 8,386 shares of the Company s common stock.  

This
transaction was treated as though the exchanging note holders agreed to exchange their convertible notes (including accrued interest)
into common stock at a 50% discount to the conversion rate ($11.3750 per share) provided for by the terms of the convertible notes,
if they also exchanged all of their warrants associated with the convertible notes, plus paid cash equal to a 50% discount to
the exercise price ($11.3750 per share). For accounting purposes, the transactions have been treated as if (i) the participants
had converted the convertible notes (which included accrued but unpaid interest of $40,993) at a conversion price reduced from
$11.3750 to $5.6875 per share, and that such conversions in the aggregate resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 60,568 shares
of common stock, and (ii) the participants had exercised their original warrants to purchase an aggregate of 26,681 shares of
common stock and the New Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 14,259 shares of common stock, all at an exercise price reduced
from $11.3750 to $5.6875 per share, and that such exercise of the warrants generated an aggregate cash payment to the Company
of $232,846 and resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 40,940 shares of common stock. In connection with the exchange of
the convertible notes, original warrants, New Warrants and the payment of cash, a total of 101,508 shares of common stock in the
aggregate were issued. The closing market price of the Company s common stock during the period that these exchange transactions
were entered into ranged from $5.8500 to $7.7675 per share.  

The
Company reviewed the guidance in ASC 470-20-40-13 through 17, Recognition of Expense Upon Conversion, and in ASC 470-20-40-26,
Induced Conversions. Pursuant to this accounting guidance, for those convertible note holders accepting the Company s exchange
offer, the Company evaluated the fair value of the incremental consideration paid to induce the convertible note holders to exchange
their convertible notes for equity (i.e., 30,284 shares of common stock), based on the closing market price of the Company s
common stock on the date of each transaction, and recorded a charge to operations of $188,274.  

The
Company evaluated the warrants exchanged in conjunction with the Note Exchange Agreements. The Company calculated the fair value
of the warrants exchanged (consisting of the warrants issued in conjunction with the original issuance of the convertible notes)
as if the warrants were modified immediately before the theoretical warrant modification and immediately after such warrant modification.
As the fair value of the warrants immediately after the modifications was less than the fair value of the warrants immediately
before the modifications (both amounts calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model), the Company did not record
any accounting entry with respect to the warrant exchange transactions.  

The
fair value of the warrants subject to the Note Exchange Agreements was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
utilizing the following assumptions:  

Unit
Exchange Agreements    

During
April and May 2016, the Company entered into Unit Exchange Agreements with certain warrant holders, including two affiliates,
one of whom was Dr. Manuso, and the other of whom was a non-officer/director affiliate, both as described below. The Unit Exchange
Agreements were substantially similar, and provided for the warrant holders to exchange (i) existing warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 218,187 shares of the Company s common stock (which were cancelled as a result of the respective exchange transactions),
plus (ii) an aggregate of $529,394 in cash, in return for (i) an aggregate of 108,594 shares of the Company s common stock,
and (ii) new warrants to purchase an aggregate of 108,594 shares of the Company s common stock. The new warrants have the
same expiration date as the original warrants (September 30, 2020) and may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at $4.8750
per share.  

Among
the executed Unit Exchange Agreements, the Company entered into a Unit Exchange Agreement with Dr. Manuso effective April 6, 2016
(the financial information with respect thereto is included in the summary paragraph presented above), pursuant to which Dr. Manuso
exchanged a warrant to purchase 73,156 shares of the Company s common stock that was originally issued to him in the Company s
August 28, 2015 unit offering (which was cancelled as a result of the exchange transaction), plus $178,317 in cash, in return
for 36,578 shares of the Company s common stock and the issuance of a new warrant to purchase 36,578 shares of the Company s
common stock. The new warrant has the same expiration date as the original warrant (September 30, 2020) and may be exercised for
cash or on a cashless basis at $4.8750 per share. The closing market price of the Company s common stock on April 6, 2016
was $7.7675 per share.  

Among
the executed Unit Exchange Agreements, the Company also entered into Unit Exchange Agreements (which are included in the summary
paragraph above) with a non-officer/director affiliate (and his affiliate) effective May 4, 2016 (the financial information with
respect thereto is included in the summary paragraph presented above), pursuant to which this affiliate exchanged warrants to
purchase 88,132 shares of the Company s common stock that were originally issued to the affiliate in the Company s
August 28, 2015 unit offering (which were cancelled as a result of the exchange transaction), plus $214,822 in cash, in return
for 44,066 shares of the Company s common stock and the issuance of new warrants to purchase 44,066 shares of the Company s
common stock. The new warrants have the same expiration date as the original warrants (September 30, 2020) and may be exercised
for cash or on a cashless basis at $4.8750 per share. The closing market price of the Company s common stock on May 4, 2016
was $5.8500 per share.  

This
transaction was treated as though the exchanging warrant holders in the three closings of the Company s 2015 unit offering
agreed to exchange their warrants associated with such financing, plus paid cash equal to a reduced exercise price per share ($4.8750
per share) for 50% of such warrants, with 50% of the warrants replaced with similar warrants with the same term at a reduced exercise
price. For accounting purposes, the transactions have been treated as if (i) participants exercised one-half of the existing warrants
entitling them to purchase an aggregate of 217,187 shares of the Company s common stock that were originally issued to them
in the Company s unit offering, with closings on August 28, 2015, September 28, 2015 and November 2, 2015 (i.e., warrants
to purchase 108,594 shares of common stock), at an exercise price reduced from $6.8348 to $4.8750 per share, and (ii) the other
one-half of the original warrants were cancelled. The Unit Exchange Agreements also provided for the Company to issue new warrants
to the participants to purchase an aggregate of 108,594 shares of common stock. The new warrants have the same expiration date
as the original warrants (September 30, 2020) and may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at $4.8750 per share. For accounting
purposes, the transaction was treated as if the warrant exercise price for all of the warrants was reduced from $6.8348 to $4.8750
per share, in exchange for which 50% of the warrants were exercised for cash at the reduced exercise price, and the remaining
50% of the warrants continued to remain outstanding through September 30, 2020 and gained a cashless exercise provision. The closing
market price of the Company s common stock during the period that these exchange transactions were entered into ranged from
$5.8500 to $7.7675 per share.  

The
Company evaluated the warrants exchanged in conjunction with the Unit Exchange Agreements. The Company calculated the fair value
of the warrants exchanged as if the warrants were modified immediately before the theoretical warrant modification and immediately
after such warrant modification. As the fair value of the warrants immediately after the modifications was less than the fair
value of the warrants immediately before the modifications (both amounts calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model), the Company did not record any accounting entry with respect to the warrant exchange transactions.  

The
fair value of the warrants subject to the Unit Exchange Agreements was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
utilizing the following assumptions:  

Equipment    

Equipment
is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five
years.  

Long-Term
Prepaid Insurance    

Long-term
prepaid insurance represents the premium paid in March 2014 for directors and officers insurance tail coverage, which is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the policy period of six years. The amount amortizable in the ensuing twelve month period
is recorded as a current asset in the Company s consolidated balance sheet at each reporting date.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

The
Company reviews its long-lived assets, including long-term prepaid insurance, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the total amount of an asset may not be recoverable, but at least annually. An impairment loss is recognized when
estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the asset s
carrying amount. The Company has not deemed any long-lived assets as impaired at September 30, 2016.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors, Scientific Advisory Board members and consultants
for services rendered. Such issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers and directors by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis in the Company s financial statements over the vesting period of the awards. The Company accounts for stock-based
payments to Scientific Advisory Board members and consultants by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon the
measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.  

Stock
grants, which are generally subject to time-based vesting, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations
ratably over the vesting period.  

Stock
options granted to members of the Company s Scientific Advisory Board and to outside consultants are revalued each reporting
period until vested to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the stock options vest,
they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the
value on the date of vesting.  

The
fair value of stock options granted as stock-based compensation is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
and is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the
stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common
stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value
of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company s common stock.  

Stock
options and warrants issued to non-employees as compensation for services to be provided to the Company or in settlement of debt
are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair value of the stock option or warrant,
whichever can be more clearly determined. Management uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of
the stock options and warrants issued by the Company. The Company recognizes this expense over the period in which the services
are provided.  

For
stock options requiring an assessment of value during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of each stock option
award was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizing the following assumptions:  

For
stock options requiring an assessment of value during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the fair value of each stock option
award was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizing the following assumptions:  

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company issues new shares of common stock
to satisfy stock option and warrant exercises. There were no stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
Accordingly, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected impact of differences between the financial
statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  

The
Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of
its recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination
was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in
the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the period such determination was made.  

Pursuant
to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the Company s net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited
if a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within any three-year period since the last ownership change. The
Company may have had a change in control under these Sections. However, the Company does not anticipate performing a complete
analysis of the limitation on the annual use of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards until the time that it anticipates
it will be able to utilize these tax attributes.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal and state income tax
matters and does not anticipate any material amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.  

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and income taxes of various state tax jurisdictions. As the Company s net
operating losses have yet to be utilized, all previous tax years remain open to examination by Federal authorities and other jurisdictions
in which the Company currently operates or has operated in the past.  

The
Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by GAAP.
The tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the taxing authority
as of the reporting date. If the tax position is not considered  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained, then no benefits
of the position are recognized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions.
In subsequent periods, any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component of income
tax expense.  

Foreign
Currency Transactions    

The
note payable to SY Corporation, which is denominated in a foreign currency (the South Korean Won), is translated into the Company s
functional currency (the United States Dollar) at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The foreign currency exchange gain
or loss resulting from translation is recognized in the related consolidated statements of operations.  

Research
Grants    

The
Company recognizes revenues from research grants as earned based on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and issues
invoices for contract amounts billed based on the terms of the grant agreement. Amounts recorded under research grants in excess
of amounts earned are classified as unearned grant revenue liability in the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Grant
receivable reflects contractual amounts due and payable under the grant agreement. The payment of grants receivable are based
on progress reports provided to the grant provider by the Company. The research grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse
was completed in April 2015. The Company has filed all required progress reports.  

Research
grants are generally funded and paid through government or institutional programs. Amounts received under research grants are
nonrefundable, regardless of the success of the underlying research project, to the extent that such amounts are expended in accordance
with the approved grant project. The Company had no research grant revenue during the three months and nine months ended September
30, 2016. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had research grant revenues of $0 and
$86,916, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any grants receivable or unearned
grant revenues.  

Research
and Development    

Research
and development costs include compensation paid to management directing the Company s research and development activities,
and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers and organizations (including research institutes at universities),
patent fees and costs, and other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development and clinical testing of the Company s
treatments and product candidates.  

Research
and development costs incurred by the Company under research grants are expensed as incurred over the life of the underlying contracts,
unless the terms of the contract indicate that a different expensing schedule is more appropriate.  

The
Company reviews the status of its research and development contracts on a quarterly basis.  

The
Company made an advance payment to Duke University with respect to the Phase 2A clinical trial of CX1739. At September 30, 2016,
a balance of $48,912 remained from the advance payment.  

License
Agreements    

Obligations
incurred with respect to mandatory payments provided for in license agreements are recognized ratably over the appropriate period,
as specified in the underlying license agreement, and are recorded as liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated
balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Obligations incurred with respect to milestone payments provided for in license agreements are recognized when
it is probable that such milestone will be reached, and are recorded as liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated
balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Payments of such liabilities are made in the ordinary course of business.  

Patent
Costs    

Due
to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on
the Company s research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal and
filing fees, are expensed as incurred.  

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)    

Components
of comprehensive income or loss, including net income or loss, are reported in the financial statements in the period in which
they are recognized. Comprehensive income or loss is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other
events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) are reported net of any
related tax effect to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). The Company did not have any items of comprehensive income (loss)
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Earnings
per Share    

The
Company s computation of earnings per share ( EPS ) includes basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as
the income (loss) attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., warrants
and options) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential common
shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded
from the calculation of diluted EPS.  

Net
income (loss) attributable to common stockholders consists of net income or loss, as adjusted for actual and deemed preferred
stock dividends declared, amortized or accumulated.  

Loss
per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the respective periods. Basic and diluted loss per common share is the same for all periods presented because all warrants and
stock options outstanding are anti-dilutive.  

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof
to acquire shares of common stock, from its calculation of earnings per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

Reclassifications    

Certain
comparative figures in 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. These reclassifications
were immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09),
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance
under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require
that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09
also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain
or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted
only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial statement
presentation or disclosures.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one
year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management s evaluation should
be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are
issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that
it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December
15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is
not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02), Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires
a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease
payments, on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months, as well as the disclosure of key information about
leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 requires recognition in the statement of operations of a single lease cost, calculated so that
the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 requires classification of all cash payments within operating
activities in the statement of cash flows. Disclosures are required to provide the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows
arising from leases. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing
at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain
practical expedients available. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact
that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company s financial statement presentation and disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 requires, among other things, that all income tax effects
of awards be recognized in the statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled. ASU 2016-09 also allows for an employer
to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any
interim or annual period. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial
statement presentation or disclosures.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have
a material impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.

Notes Payable   

Convertible
Notes Payable    

On
November 5, 2014, the Company entered into a Convertible Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement )
with various accredited, non-affiliated investors (each, a  Purchaser ), pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate
principal amount of $238,500 of its (i) Convertible Notes due September 15, 2015 (each a  Note , and together, the
 Notes ) and (ii) Warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the  Warrants ) as described below. On
December 9, 2014, December 31, 2014, and February 2, 2015, the Company sold an additional $46,000, $85,000 and $210,000, respectively,
of principal amount of the Notes and Warrants to various accredited investors. This private placement, which generated aggregate
gross proceeds of $579,500, was terminated effective February 18, 2015. When initially issued, the outstanding principal balance
of each Note and all accrued and unpaid interest, compounded annually at 10%, was due and payable in full on September 15, 2015.
As discussed below, the maturity date of the Notes was subsequently extended to September 15, 2016, in accordance with the terms
of the Notes.  

Each
Purchaser could elect, at any time, at its option and in its sole discretion, to convert the outstanding principal amount into
a fixed number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal
amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, by $11.3750. In the case of a Qualified Financing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement),
the outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest under the Notes would automatically convert into common stock
at a common stock equivalent price of $11.3750. In the case of an Acquisition (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), the Company
could elect to either: (i) convert the outstanding principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under the Notes into shares
of common stock or (ii) accelerate the maturity date of the Notes to the date of closing of the Acquisition. Each Warrant to purchase
shares of common stock was exercisable into a fixed number of shares of common stock of the Company calculated as each Purchaser s
investment amount divided by $11.3750. The Warrants were originally exercisable through September 15, 2015 at a fixed price of
$11.3750 per share and did not have any cashless exercise provisions. The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Notes and exercise of the Warrants were not subject to any registration rights.  

Placement
agent fees, brokerage commissions, and similar payments were made in the form of cash and warrants to qualified referral sources
in connection with the sale of the Notes and Warrants. In connection with the initial closing on November 5, 2014, fees of $16,695
were paid in cash, based on 7% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued to such referral sources, and the fees paid
in warrants (the  Placement Agent Warrants ) consisted of 1,467 warrants, reflecting warrants for that number of shares
equal to 7% of the number of shares of common stock into which the corresponding Notes are convertible. In connection with the
second closing, fees of $700 were paid in cash and 62 Placement Agent Warrants were issued. In connection with the third closing,
fees of $3,500 were paid in cash and 308 Placement Agent Warrants were issued. In connection with the fourth closing, fees of
$14,700 were paid in cash and 1,292 Placement Agent Warrants were issued. The Placement Agent Warrants have cashless exercise
provisions and were exercisable through September 15, 2015 at a fixed price of $11.3750 per share. The warrants issued to the
placement agent and/or its designees or affiliates in connection with the 2014 closings of the Purchase Agreement, to purchase
1,837 shares of the Company s common stock, were valued pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at $19,986, $614
and $3,340, respectively. The warrants issued to the placement agent and/or its designees or affiliates in connection with the
February 2, 2015 closing of the Purchase Agreement, to purchase 1,292 shares of the Company s common stock, were valued
pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at $12,726. Total financing costs relating to all closings of the Notes aggregated
$129,776, consisting of $93,110 paid in cash and $36,666 paid in the form of Placement Agent Warrants, and were being amortized
as additional interest expense over the original term of the Notes through September 15, 2015. During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $35,306, respectively, was charged to interest expense with respect to the amortization of capitalized
financing costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $114,129, respectively, was charged to interest
expense with respect to the amortization of capitalized financing costs.  

Aurora
Capital LLC, a related party as described at Note 7, was the placement agent for this financing, and Aurora and its designees
and/or affiliates received aggregate fees in connection with this financing in the form of $33,425 in cash and Placement Agent
Warrants to purchase 2,938 shares of common stock in connection with the four closings.  

The
Notes and Warrants were offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities
Act ), in reliance on the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as provided in Rule 506 of Regulation
D promulgated thereunder. The Notes and Warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise
of the Warrants were not registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act.  

The
Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of the Warrants to purchase 50,945 shares of the
Company s common stock sold to investors in connection with the four closings at a fixed exercise price of $11.3750 per
share. The Company considered the face value of the Notes to be representative of their fair value. The Company applied the relative
fair value method to allocate the proceeds from the borrowing to the Notes and the Warrants. Consequently, approximately 50% of
the proceeds of the borrowing of $290,394 were attributed to the debt instrument. The 50% value attributed to the Warrants of
$289,106 was amortized as additional interest expense over the original term of the Notes. During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $84,858, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the amortization of debt discount related
to the value attributed to the Warrants. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $267,822, respectively,
was charged to interest expense from the amortization of debt discount related to the value attributed to the Warrants. The carrying
value of the Notes was further reduced by a discount for a beneficial conversion feature of $290,394. The value attributed to
the beneficial conversion feature was amortized as additional interest expense over the original term of the Notes. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $83,512, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the amortization
of debt discount related to the value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, $0 and $265,529, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the amortization of debt discount related
to the value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature.

August 13, 2015, the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Notes, gave the Note holders written notice, thirty days in advance
of the September 15, 2015 maturity date of the Notes, of the Company s election to extend the maturity date of the Notes
to September 15, 2016. As a consequence of this election, under the terms of the Notes, the Company issued to Note holders 27,396
additional warrants (the  New Warrants ) that were exercisable through September 15, 2016. As set forth in the Notes,
the New Warrants were exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the Company calculated as the principal amount
of the Notes (an aggregate amount of $579,500), plus any accrued and unpaid interest (an aggregate amount of $43,758), multiplied
by 50%, and then divided by $11.3750. The New Warrants otherwise had terms substantially similar to the 50,945 Warrants originally
sold to investors. In connection with the extension of the maturity date of the Notes, the Board of Directors of the Company also
determined to extend the termination date of the 50,945 original Warrants to September 15, 2016, so that they were coterminous
with the new maturity date of the Notes.  

The
Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of the New Warrants to purchase 27,396 shares of
the Company s common stock and the fair value of extending the termination date of the 50,945 original Warrants sold to
investors. The Company considered the face value of the Notes, plus the accrued interest thereon, to be representative of their
fair value. The relative fair value method generated respective fair values for each of the Notes, including accrued interest,
and the New Warrants and extension of the original Warrants, of approximately 55% for the Notes, including accrued interest, and
approximately 45% for the New Warrants and extension of the original Warrants. The 45% value attributed to the New Warrants and
extension of the original Warrants of $277,918 was amortized as additional interest expense over the extended term of the Notes.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $27,847 and $11,390, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the
amortization of debt discount related to the value attributed to the New Warrants and extension of the original Warrants. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $129,857 and $11,390, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the
amortization of debt discount related to the value attributed to the New Warrants and extension of the original Warrants. The
carrying value of the Notes was further reduced by a discount for a beneficial conversion feature of $206,689. The value attributed
to the beneficial conversion feature was amortized as additional interest expense over the extended term of the Notes. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $20,710 and $8,471, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the
amortization of debt discount related to the value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, $96,576 and $8,471, respectively, was charged to interest expense from the amortization of debt discount
related to the value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature.  

Effective
September 14, 2015, placement agent warrants previously issued in connection with the four closings of the Note and Warrant financing
in December 2014 through February 2015, representing the right to acquire a total of 3,129 shares of common stock, were exercised
on a cashless basis, resulting in the net issuance of 145 shares of common stock. The gross exercise price of the placement agent
warrants that were exercised on a cashless basis was $35,595.  

During
April and May 2016, the Company entered into Note Exchange Agreements with certain note holders representing an aggregate of $303,500
of principal amount of the Notes (out of a total of $579,500 of original principal amount of the Notes). Pursuant to the Note
Exchange Agreements, an aggregate of $344,483, which included accrued interest of $40,983, of the Notes were exchanged (together
with original warrants to purchase 26,681 shares of the Company s common stock, New Warrants to purchase 14,259 shares of
the Company s common stock, and the payment of an aggregate of $232,846 in cash) into a total of 101,508 shares of the Company s
common stock. None of the Notes had previously been converted into shares of the Company s common stock. For accounting
purposes, for those convertible note holders accepting the Company s exchange offer, the Company evaluated the fair value
of the incremental consideration paid to induce the convertible note holders to exchange their convertible notes for equity (i.e.,
30,284 shares of common stock), based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of each transaction,
and recorded a charge to operations of $188,274. Information with respect to the Black-Scholes variables used in connection with
the evaluation of the fair value of the exchange consideration is provided at Note 2.  

During
nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the Note Exchange Agreements, the Company wrote off and charged to interest
expense the unamortized discount related to the value attributed to the New Warrants and the extension of the original Warrants
of $66,811, and the unamortized discount related to the value attributed to the related beneficial conversion feature of $49,688.  

On
September 15, 2016, the remaining outstanding Notes previously issued by the Company on November 5, 2014, December 9, 2014, December
31, 2014, and February 2, 2015, matured and the principal and accrued interest under those remaining Notes became due and payable
upon demand. At the September 15, 2016 maturity date, Notes totaling $329,261, which included accrued interest of $53,261, became
due and payable upon demand. During October 2016, holders of four Notes totaling $73,004, which included accrued interest of $12,004
at September 30, 2016, issued formal notices of default, and as a result, those four Notes were deemed to be in default under
the terms of the Notes and began to accrue interest at the default rate of 12% per annum from the default date in accordance with
the terms of the Notes.  

In
addition, on September 15, 2016, the remaining outstanding 13,137 New Warrants and 24,264 original Warrants (which had been previously
extended) expired.  

The
Notes consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

As
of September 30, 2016, the remaining outstanding Notes were convertible into 29,057 shares of the Company s common stock,
including 4,794 shares attributable to accrued interest of $54,528 payable as of such date. As of December 31, 2015, the Notes
were convertible into 56,342 shares of the Company s common stock, including 5,397 shares attributable to accrued interest
of $61,388 payable as of such date.

On
June 25, 2012, the Company borrowed 465,000,000 Won (the currency of South Korea, equivalent to approximately $400,000 United

the Company, but the Company has not yet issued a notice of default. The Company is continuing efforts towards a comprehensive
resolution of the aforementioned matters involving SY Corporation.

of matter patents for certain of the Company s high impact ampakine compounds and the low impact ampakine compounds CX2007
and CX2076, and other related compounds. The security interest does not extend to the Company s patents for its ampakine
compounds CX1739 and CX1942, or to the patent for the use of ampakine compounds for the treatment of respiratory depression.

totaling $3,955 as compensation and an obligation of the Company to issue warrants to acquire 39,585 shares of common stock, totaling

which is 120% of the conversion price at which the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock may convert into the Company s
common stock. The warrants issuable to the placement agents and selected dealers in connection with the initial tranche of the
Series G Private Placement were valued pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at $443,848.

Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock nor the underlying shares of common stock had any registration rights.  

The
placement agents and selected dealers in connection with the second tranche of the Series G Private Placement received cash fees
of $3,465 as compensation and an obligation of the Company to issue warrants to acquire 19,650 shares of common stock, totaling

Series G Private Placement were valued pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at $220,321.  

The
Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock had a stated value of $1,000 per share and a stated dividend at the rate per share (as
a percentage of the Stated Value per share) of 1.5% per annum, compounded quarterly, payable quarterly within 15 calendar days
of the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, which may include fractional shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock. As
the stated value of the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock was $1,000 per share, and the fixed conversion price was $1.0725,
each share of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into 932.4 shares of common stock. The aggregate of 928.5
shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock sold in all of the closings of the Series G Private Placement were initially
convertible into a total of 865,734 shares of common stock.  

The
Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock became convertible, beginning 60 days after the last share of Series G 1.5% Convertible
Preferred Stock was issued in the Series G Private Placement, at the option of the holder, into common stock at the applicable
conversion price, at a rate determined by dividing the Stated Value of the shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock
to be converted by the conversion price, subject to adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations and similar events as
described in the form of Certificate of Designation. In addition, the Company had the right to require the holders of the Series
G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock to convert such shares into common stock under certain enumerated circumstances as set forth
in the Certificate of Designation.  

Upon
either (i) a Qualified Public Offering (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the Stated Value of the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, all outstanding shares
of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, plus all accrued or declared, but unpaid, dividends thereon, were mandatorily convertible
into such number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the Stated Value of such Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred
Stock (together with the amount of any accrued or declared, but unpaid, dividends thereon) by the Conversion Price (as defined
in the Certificate of Designation).  

Except
as described in the Certificate of Designation, holders of the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock voted together with holders
of the Company common stock on all matters, on an as-converted to common stock basis, and not as a separate class or series (subject
to limited exceptions).  

In
the event of any liquidation or winding up of the Company prior to and in preference to any Junior Securities (including common
stock), the holders of the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of
the Company s common stock, a per share amount equal to the Stated Value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.  

Purchasers

number of authorized shares of the Company to 1,405,000,000, of which 1,400,000,000 were shares of common stock and 5,000,000

Certificate of Incorporation to effect the increase in the authorized shares was filed with the Secretary of State of the State

Pursuant
to the amendment, an aggregate of 191.068 fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were not issued, but are being
paid out in cash (without interest or deduction) in an amount equal to the number of shares exchanged into such fractional share
multiplied by the average closing trading price of the Company s common stock on the OTCQB for the five trading days immediately
before the Certificate of Amendment effecting the reverse stock split was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State ($6.7899
per share, on a post reverse stock split basis) for a total of $1,298.  

On
September 18, 2014, Dr. John Greer, Ph.D., was appointed to the position of Chairman of the Company s Scientific Advisory

Based on the Company s closing stock price on October 15, 2014 of $25.3500 per share, during the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $39,000 and $117,000, respectively, with respect to this

On
August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Common Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase
Agreement ) with various accredited investors (each, a  Purchaser , and together with purchasers in subsequent
closings in the private placement, the  Purchasers ), pursuant to which the Company sold units for aggregate cash
consideration of $721,180, with each unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company s common stock, representing an aggregate
of 105,517 shares of common stock, and (ii) one warrant to purchase two additional shares of common stock, representing an aggregate
of 211,034 warrants. This financing represented the initial closing of a private placement of up to $3,000,000. On September 28,
2015, the Company completed a second closing of the Purchase Agreement with various additional Purchasers, pursuant to which the
Company sold units for aggregate cash consideration of $218,530, with each unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company s
common stock, representing an aggregate of 31,973 shares of common stock, and (ii) one warrant to purchase two additional shares
of common stock, representing an aggregate of 63,946 Warrants. On November 2, 2015, the Company completed a third closing of the
Purchase Agreement with various Purchasers, pursuant to which the Company sold units for aggregate cash consideration of $255,000,
with each unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company s common stock, representing an aggregate of 37,309 shares of
common stock, and (ii) one warrant to purchase two additional shares of common stock, representing an aggregate of 74,618 warrants.
This third closing brought the aggregate amount raised under this private placement as of November 2, 2015 to $1,194,710.  

The
unit price in each closing of the private placement was $6.8348 (the  Per Unit Price ). The Warrants are exercisable
through September 30, 2020 and may be exercised at a price of $6.8348 for each share of Common Stock to be acquired upon exercise.
The Purchasers consisted of non-affiliated investors, other than Dr. James S. Manuso, the current President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, who invested $250,000 in the initial closing of the private placement, and one other investor who invested
$301,180 in the private placement and became an affiliate of the Company by virtue of his aggregate stock holdings in the Company.
The Warrants do not contain any cashless exercise provisions or reset rights.  

No
registration rights were granted to any Purchaser in this private placement with respect to (i) the shares of common stock issued
as part of the units, (ii) the warrants, or (iii) the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.  

Placement
agent fees, brokerage commissions, and similar payments were made in the form of cash and warrants to qualified referral sources
in connection with certain sales of the shares of common stock and warrants, while other sales, including the sale to Dr. James
S. Manuso, did not result in any fees or commissions. Accordingly, the amount of such fees, on a percentage basis, varies in each
closing. The fees paid to such referral sources for the initial closing in cash totaled $47,118, or 6.5% of the aggregate amount
paid for the units sold. The fees paid in warrants for the initial closing to such referral sources (the warrants paid to qualified
referral sources are referred to herein as the  Placement Agent Warrants ) consist of warrants for 6,894 shares of
common stock, or that number of shares equal to 6.5% of the number of shares of common stock issued as part of the units, but
not the shares underlying the warrants. In connection with the second closing, fees paid to referral sources in cash totaled $18,603,
or 8.5% of the aggregate amount paid for the units sold, and 2,722 Placement Agent Warrants were issued, or warrants for that
number of shares equal to 8.5% of the number of shares of common stock issued as part of the units, but not the shares underlying
the Warrants. In connection with the third closing, fees paid to referral sources in cash totaled $25,500, or 10% of the aggregate
amount paid for the units sold, and 3,731 Placement Agent Warrants were issued, or warrants for that number of shares equal to
10% of the number of shares of common stock issued as part of the units, but not the shares underlying the Warrants. Placement
Agent Warrants are exercisable until September 30, 2020 at the Per Unit Price. The Placement Agent Warrants have cashless exercise
provisions. One of the placement agents that received Placement Agent Warrants is Aurora. Both Arnold S. Lippa and Jeff E. Margolis,
officers and directors of the Company, have indirect ownership interests in Aurora through interests held in its members, and
Jeff E. Margolis is also an officer of Aurora. As a result, both Arnold S. Lippa and Jeff E. Margolis, or entities in which they
have interests, will receive a portion of the Placement Agent Warrants awarded in this private placement.  

In
addition to the above described placement agent fees, brokerage commissions, and similar payments that were made in the form of
cash and warrants to qualified referral sources, the Company also paid $10,164 in cash to other professionals for services related
to the three closings.  

The
shares of common stock and warrants were offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act in reliance on the exemptions
provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as provided in Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. None of the
shares of common stock issued as part of the units, the warrants, the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, the
Placement Agent Warrants or the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Placement Agent Warrants were registered
under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  

During
April and May 2016, the Company entered into Unit Exchange Agreements with certain warrant holders who had acquired units in connection
with the Second Amended and Restated Common Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement. The Unit Exchange Agreements provided for the
warrant holders to exchange (i) existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 217,187 shares of the Company s common stock,
plus (ii) an aggregate of $529,394 in cash, in return for (i) an aggregate of 108,594 shares of the Company s common stock
with a total market price of $728,859 (average $6.7275 per share), and (ii) new warrants to purchase an aggregate of 108,594 shares
of the Company s common stock with an exercise price of $4.8750 per share, exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis through
the original expiration date of September 30, 2020.  

For
accounting purposes, for those unit warrant holders accepting the Company s exchange offer, the Company evaluated the fair
value of the incremental consideration paid to induce the unit warrant holders to exchange their original warrants for exchanged
warrants and determined that the Company did not incur any cost with respect to the exchange transactions. Information with respect
to the Black-Scholes variables used in connection with the evaluation of the fair value of the exchange consideration is provided
at Note 2.  

On
January 8, 2016, the Company initiated a new equity private placement, consisting of units of common stock and warrants, up to
an aggregate of $2,500,000, with each unit consisting of (i) one share of common stock, and (ii) one warrant to purchase two additional
shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into purchase agreements with nine
accredited and four non-accredited, non-affiliated investors, pursuant to which an aggregate of 43,003 shares of common stock
and an aggregate of 86,006 warrants were sold, generating gross proceeds of $309,985.  

Included
in the gross proceeds of $309,985 received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,350 received on June 30, 2016
from the sale of 3,517 shares of common stock and an aggregate of 7,034 warrants to an unrelated entity with which the Company
simultaneously entered into one-year agreement for investor relations services.  

The
unit price in the private placement closings was $7.2085. The warrants are exercisable at $7.9300, for each share of common stock
to be acquired, and expire on February 28, 2021. The warrants have cashless exercise provisions and contain certain  blocker 
provisions limiting the percentage of shares of the Company s common stock that the purchaser can beneficially own upon
conversion to not more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares immediately after giving effect to the warrant exercise.  

In
the case of an acquisition in which the Company is not the surviving entity, the holder of the warrant would receive from any
surviving entity or successor to the Company, in exchange for the warrant, a new warrant from the surviving entity or successor
to the Company, substantially in the form of the existing warrant and with an exercise price adjusted to reflect the nearest equivalent
exercise price of common stock (or other applicable equity interest) of the surviving entity that would reflect the economic value
of the warrant, but in the surviving entity.  

No
registration rights were granted to the purchasers in the private placement with respect to (i) the shares of common stock issued
as part of the units, (ii) the warrants, or (iii) the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.  

No
placement agent fees, brokerage commissions, finder s fees or similar payments were made in the form of cash or warrants
to qualified referral sources in connection with the sale of the shares of common stock and warrants. The Company paid $3,429
in cash to other professionals for services related to the seven closings.

The
exercise prices of common stock options outstanding and exercisable were as follows at September 30, 2015:  

Based
on a fair market value of $9.0350 per share on September 30, 2015, the intrinsic value of exercisable in-the-money common stock
options was $760,304 as of September 30, 2015.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock-based compensation costs included in the condensed consolidated statements
of operations consisted of general and administrative expenses of $837,630 and $1,288,479, respectively, and research and development

costs included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations consisted of general and administrative expenses of $2,821,748
and $1,727,079, respectively, and research and development expenses of $1,129,526 and $250,787, respectively.  

Pier
Contingent Stock Consideration    

In
connection with the merger transaction with Pier effective August 10, 2012, RespireRx issued 179,747 newly issued shares of its
common stock with an aggregate fair value of $3,271,402 ($18.2000 per share), based upon the closing price of RespireRx s
common stock on August 10, 2012. The shares of common stock were distributed to stockholders, convertible note holders, warrant
holders, option holders, and certain employees and vendors of Pier in satisfaction of their interests and claims. The common stock
issued by RespireRx represented approximately 41% of the 443,205 common shares outstanding immediately following the closing of
the transaction.  

Pursuant
to the terms of the transaction, RespireRx agreed to issue additional contingent consideration, consisting of up to 56,351 shares
of common stock, to Pier s former security holders and certain other creditors and service providers (the  Pier Stock
Recipients ) that received RespireRx s common stock as part of the Pier transaction if certain of RespireRx s
stock options and warrants outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the merger were subsequently exercised. In the event
that such contingent shares were issued, the ownership percentage of the Pier Stock Recipients, following their receipt of such
additional shares, could not exceed their ownership percentage as of the initial transaction date.  

The
stock options and warrants outstanding at June 30, 2012 were all out-of-the-money on August 10, 2012. During late July and early
August 2012, shortly before completion of the merger, the Company issued options to officers and directors at that time to purchase
a total of 22,651 shares of common stock exercisable for ten years at $19.5000 per share. By October 1, 2012, these options, as
well as the options and warrants outstanding at June 30, 2012, were also out-of-the-money and continued to be out-of-the-money
through September 30, 2016.  

There
were no stock options or warrants exercised subsequent to August 10, 2012 that triggered additional contingent consideration,
and the only remaining stock options outstanding that could still trigger the additional contingent consideration remained generally
out-of-the-money through September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, due to the expirations and forfeitures of RespireRx stock
options and warrants occurring since August 10, 2012, 6,497 contingent shares of common stock remained issuable under the Pier
merger agreement.  

The
Company concluded that the issuance of any of the contingent shares to the Pier Stock Recipients was remote, as a result of the
large spread between the exercise prices of these stock options and warrants as compared to the common stock trading range, the
subsequent expiration or forfeiture of most of the options and warrants, the Company s distressed financial condition and
capital requirements, and that these stock options and warrants have generally remained significantly out-of-the-money through
September 30, 2016. Accordingly, the Company considered the fair value of the contingent consideration to be immaterial and therefore
did not ascribe any value to such contingent consideration. If any such shares are ultimately issued to the former Pier stockholders,
the Company will recognize the fair value of such shares as a charge to operations at that time.  

Reserved
and Unreserved Shares of Common Stock    

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had 65,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 2,018,761 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had reserved an aggregate of 11 shares for issuance upon conversion
of the Series B Preferred Stock; 409,914 shares for issuance upon exercise of warrants; 1,307,749 shares for issuance upon exercise
of outstanding stock options; 63,236 shares to cover equity grants available for future issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan; 292,201
shares to cover equity grants available for future issuance pursuant to the 2015 Plan; 29,057 shares for issuance upon conversion
of the Convertible Notes; and 6,497 shares issuable as contingent shares pursuant to the Pier merger. Accordingly, as of September
30, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of 2,108,664 shares of common stock reserved for issuance and 60,872,575 shares of common
stock unreserved and available for future issuance. The Company expects to satisfy its future common stock commitments through
the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

The
employment agreements between the Company and each of Dr. Manuso, Dr. Lippa, Mr. Margolis and Mr. Weingarten, respectively, provided

at least $2,000,000 of net proceeds from any offering or financing of debt or equity, or a combination thereof, was received by
the Company, at which time scheduled payments were to commence. As this financing milestone has not been achieved, Dr. Manuso,
Dr. Lippa, Mr. Margolis and Mr. Weingarten (who are each also directors of the Company) have each agreed, effective as of August
11, 2016, to continue to defer the payment of such amounts indefinitely, until such time as the Board of Directors of the Company
determines that sufficient capital has been raised by the Company or is otherwise available to fund the Company s operations
on an ongoing basis.  

University
of California, Irvine License Agreements    

The
Company entered into a series of license agreements in 1993 and 1998 with the University of California, Irvine ( UCI )
that granted the Company proprietary rights to certain chemical compounds that acted as ampakines and to their therapeutic uses.
These agreements granted the Company, among other provisions, exclusive rights: (i) to practice certain patents and patent applications,
as defined in the license agreement, that were then held by UCI; (ii) to identify, develop, make, have made, import, export, lease,
sell, have sold or offer for sale any related licensed products; and (iii) to grant sub-licenses of the rights granted in the
license agreements, subject to the provisions of the license agreements. The Company was required, among other terms and conditions,
to pay UCI a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain additional payments.  

Under
such license agreements, the Company was required to make minimum annual royalty payments of approximately $70,000. The Company
was also required to spend a minimum of $250,000 per year to advance the ampakine compounds until the Company began to market
an ampakine compound. The commercialization provisions in the agreements with UCI required the Company to file for regulatory
approval of an ampakine compound before October 2012. In March 2011, UCI agreed to extend the required date for filing regulatory
approval of an ampakine compound to October 2015. During December 2012, the Company informed UCI that it would be unable to make
the annual payment due to a lack of funds. The Company believes that this notice, along with its subsequent failure to make its
minimum annual payment obligation, constituted a default and termination of the license agreements.  

On
April 15, 2013, the Company received a letter from UCI indicating that the license agreements between UCI and the Company had
been terminated due to the Company s failure to make certain payments required to maintain the agreements. Since the patents
covered in these license agreements had begun to expire and the therapeutic uses described in these patents were no longer germane
to the Company s new focus on respiratory disorders, the loss of these license agreements is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s current drug development programs. In the opinion of management, the Company has made adequate provision
for any liability relating to this matter in its consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

University
of Alberta License Agreement    

On
May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as amended, with the University of Alberta granting the Company exclusive
rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory
disorders. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta a licensing fee and a patent issuance fee, which were paid, and
prospective payments consisting of a royalty on net sales, sublicense fee payments, maintenance payments and milestone payments.
The prospective maintenance payments commence on the enrollment of the first patient into the first Phase 2B clinical trial and
increase upon the successful completion of the Phase 2B clinical trial. As the Company does not at this time anticipate scheduling
a Phase 2B clinical trial in the near term, no maintenance payments to the University of Alberta are currently due and payable,
nor are any maintenance payments expected to be due in the near future in connection with the license agreement.  

Transactions
with Biovail Laboratories International SRL    

In
March 2010, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Biovail Laboratories International SRL ( Biovail ).
Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Biovail acquired the Company s interests in CX717, CX1763, CX1942 and the injectable
dosage form of CX1739, as well as certain of its other ampakine compounds and related intellectual property for use in the field
of respiratory depression or vaso-occlusive crises associated with sickle cell disease. The agreement provided the Company with
the right to receive milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to $15,000,000 plus the reimbursement of certain related
expenses, conditioned upon the occurrence of particular events relating to the clinical development of certain assets that Biovail
acquired. None of these events occurred.  

As
part of the transaction, Biovail licensed back to the Company certain exclusive and irrevocable rights to some acquired ampakine
compounds, other than CX717, an injectable dosage form of CX1739, CX1763 and CX1942, for use outside of the field of respiratory
depression or vaso-occlusive crises associated with sickle cell disease. Accordingly, following the transaction with Biovail,
the Company retained its rights to develop and commercialize the non-acquired ampakine compounds as a potential treatment for
neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the Company retained its rights to develop and commercialize the
ampakine compounds as a potential treatment for sleep apnea disorders, including an oral dosage form of ampakine CX1739.  

In
September 2010, Biovail s parent corporation, Biovail Corporation, combined with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in
a merger transaction and the combined company was renamed  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  ( Valeant ).
Following the merger, Valeant and Biovail conducted a strategic and financial review of their product pipeline and, as a result,
in November 2010, Biovail announced its intent to exit from the respiratory depression project acquired from the Company in March
2010.  

Following
that announcement, the Company entered into discussions with Biovail regarding the future of the respiratory depression project.
In March 2011, the Company entered into a new agreement with Biovail to reacquire the ampakine compounds, patents and rights that
Biovail had acquired from the Company in March 2010. The new agreement provided for potential future payments of up to $15,150,000
by the Company based upon the achievement of certain developments, including new drug application submissions and approval milestones.
Biovail is also eligible to receive additional payments of up to $15,000,000 from the Company based upon the Company s net
sales of an intravenous dosage form of the compounds for respiratory depression.  

At
any time following the completion of Phase 1 clinical studies and prior to the end of Phase 2A clinical studies, Biovail retains
an option to co-develop and co-market intravenous dosage forms of an ampakine compound as a treatment for respiratory depression
and vaso-occlusive crises associated with sickle cell disease. In such an event, the Company would be reimbursed for certain development
expenses to date and Biovail would share in all such future development costs with the Company. If Biovail makes the co-marketing
election, the Company would owe no further milestone payments to Biovail and the Company would be eligible to receive a royalty
on net sales of the compound by Biovail or its affiliates and licensees.  

University
of Illinois 2014 Exclusive License Agreement    

On
June 27, 2014, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the  2014 License Agreement ) with the University
of Illinois, the material terms of which were similar to a License Agreement between the parties that had been previously terminated
on March 21, 2013. The 2014 License Agreement became effective on September 18, 2014, upon the completion of certain conditions
set forth in the 2014 License Agreement, including: (i) the payment by the Company of a $25,000 licensing fee, (ii) the payment
by the Company of outstanding patent costs aggregating $15,840, and (iii) the assignment to the University of Illinois of rights
the Company held in certain patent applications, all of which conditions were fulfilled.  

The
2014 License Agreement granted the Company (i) exclusive rights to several issued and pending patents in numerous jurisdictions
and (ii) the non-exclusive right to certain technical information that is generated by the University of Illinois in connection
with certain clinical trials as specified in the 2014 License Agreement, all of which relate to the use of cannabinoids for the
treatment of sleep related breathing disorders. The Company is developing dronabinol ( 9-tetrahydrocannabinol), a cannabinoid,
for the treatment of OSA, the most common form of sleep apnea.  

The
2014 License Agreement provides for various commercialization and reporting requirements commencing on June 30, 2015 and also
requires the Company to pay the University of Illinois a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain milestone payments.
The 2014 License Agreement provides for various royalty payments by the Company, including a royalty on net sales of 4%, payment
on sub-licensee revenues of 12.5%, and a minimum annual royalty of $100,000 beginning in 2015, which is due and payable on December
31 of each year. The 2015 minimum annual royalty of $100,000 was paid as scheduled in December 2015, and the 2016 minimum annual
royalty of $100,000 is payable in December 2016. In the year after the first application for market approval is submitted to the
FDA and until approval is obtained, the minimum annual royalty will increase to $150,000. In the year after the first market approval
is obtained from the FDA and until the first sale of a product, the minimum annual royalty payable by the Company will increase
to $200,000. In the year after the first commercial sale of a product, the minimum annual royalty will increase to $250,000.  

The
2014 License Agreement also provides for certain one-time milestone payments by the Company. A payment of $75,000 is due within
five days after any one of the following: (a) dosing of the first patient with a product in a Phase 2 human clinical study anywhere
in the world that is not sponsored by the University of Illinois, (b) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 human clinical
study anywhere in the world with a low dose of dronabinol, or (c) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 human clinical study
anywhere in the world with a proprietary reformulation of dronabinol. A payment of $350,000 is due within five days after dosing
of the first patient with a product in a Phase 3 human clinical trial anywhere in the world. A payment of $500,000 is due within
five days after the first new drug application filing with the FDA or a foreign equivalent for a product. A payment of $1,000,000
is due within 12 months after the first commercial sale of a product.  

During
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $25,000 and
$75,000, respectively, with respect to its 2016 and 2015 minimum annual royalty obligation, which is included in research and
development expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. If the Company is unable to make the 2016 minimum annual royalty payment of $100,000 in December
2016, such non-payment could result in the cancellation of the 2014 License Agreement.  

Research
Contract with the University of Alberta    

On
January 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Research Contract with the University of Alberta in order to test the efficacy of
ampakines at a variety of dosage and formulation levels in the potential treatment of Pompe Disease, apnea of prematurity and
spinal cord injury, as well as to conduct certain electrophysiological studies to explore the ampakine mechanism of action for
central respiratory depression. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta total consideration of approximately CAD$146,000
(approximately US$111,000), consisting of approximately CAD$85,000 (approximately US$65,000) of personnel funding in cash in four
installments during 2016, to provide approximately CAD$21,000 (approximately US$16,000) in equipment, to pay patent costs of CAD$20,000
(approximately US$15,000), and to underwrite additional budgeted costs of CAD$20,000 (approximately US$15,000). As of September
30, 2016, CAD$21,250 (approximately US$16,150) remained payable under this agreement and is included in accounts payable and accrued
expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. The conversion to US dollars above
utilizes an exchange rate of US$0.76 for every CAD$1.00.  

The
University of Alberta will receive matching funds through a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in support of
the research. The Company will retain the rights to research results and any patentable intellectual property generated by the
research. Dr. John Greer, Chairman of the Company s Scientific Advisory Board and faculty member of the Department of Physiology,
Perinatal Research Centre and Women   Children s Health Research Institute, and Alberta Innovates - Health Sciences
Senior Scientist with the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute at the University of Alberta, will collaborate on this research.
The studies are expected to be completed in 2016.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Overview   

Since
its formation in 1987, RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( RespireRx ) has been engaged in the research and clinical
development of a class of compounds referred to as ampakines, which act to enhance the actions of the excitatory neurotransmitter
glutamate at AMPA glutamate receptors. Several ampakines, in both oral and injectable form, are being developed by the Company
for the treatment of a variety of breathing disorders. In clinical studies, select ampakines have shown preliminary efficacy in
central sleep apnea and in the control of respiratory depression produced by opioids, without altering their analgesic effects.
In animal models of orphan disorders, such as Pompe Disease, spinal cord damage and perinatal respiratory distress, it has been
demonstrated that certain ampakines improve breathing function. The Company s compounds belong to a new class of ampakines
that do not display the undesirable side effects previously reported in animal models of earlier generations  

The
Company owns patents and patent applications, or the rights thereto, for certain families of chemical compounds, including ampakines,
which claim the chemical structures and their use in the treatment of various disorders. These patents cover, among other compounds,
the Company s lead ampakines CX1739 and CX1942, and extend through at least 2028.  

In
2011, RespireRx conducted a re-evaluation of its strategic focus and determined that clinical development in the area of respiratory
disorders, particularly sleep apnea and drug-induced respiratory depression, provided the most cost-effective opportunities for
potential rapid development and commercialization of RespireRx s compounds. Accordingly, RespireRx narrowed its clinical
focus at that time and sidelined other avenues of scientific inquiry. This re-evaluation provided the impetus for RespireRx s
acquisition of Pier Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Pier ) in August 2012, as described below. RespireRx and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Pier, are collectively referred to herein as the  Company.   

The
Company has continued to implement this strategic focus, notwithstanding a change in management in March 2013, and has continued
its efforts to obtain the capital necessary to fund the clinical efforts. As a result of the Company s scientific discoveries
and the acquisition of strategic, exclusive license agreements, management believes that the Company is now a leader in developing
drugs for respiratory disorders, particularly sleep apneas and drug-induced respiratory depression.  

On
May 8, 2007, RespireRx entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting RespireRx
exclusive rights to method of treatment patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment
of various respiratory disorders. These patents, along with RespireRx s own patents claiming chemical structures, comprise
RespireRx s principal intellectual property supporting RespireRx s research and clinical development program in the
use of ampakines for the treatment of respiratory disorders. RespireRx has completed preclinical studies indicating that several
of its ampakines, including CX717, CX1739 and CX1942, were efficacious in treating drug induced respiratory depression caused
by opioids or certain anesthetics without offsetting the analgesic effects of the opioids or the anesthetic effects of the anesthetics.
In two clinical Phase 2 studies, one of which was published in a peer-reviewed journal, CX717, a predecessor compound to CX1739
and CX1942, antagonized the respiratory depression produced by fentanyl, a potent narcotic, without affecting the analgesia produced
by this drug. In addition, RespireRx has conducted a Phase 2A clinical study in which patients with sleep apnea were administered
CX1739, RespireRx s lead clinical compound. The results suggested that CX1739 might have use as a treatment for central
sleep apnea ( CSA ) and mixed sleep apnea, but not obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ).  

In
order to expand RespireRx s respiratory disorders program, RespireRx acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity
securities of Pier effective August 10, 2012 pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. Pier was formed in June 2007 (under
the name SteadySleep Rx Co.) as a clinical stage pharmaceutical company to develop a pharmacologic treatment for OSA and had been
engaged in research and clinical development activities.  

Prior
to the merger, Pier conducted a 21 day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 2 clinical study in
22 patients with OSA, in which dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index, the primary
therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well tolerated.  

Through
the merger, RespireRx gained access to an Exclusive License Agreement (as amended, the  2007 License Agreement ) that
Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The 2007 License Agreement covered certain patents
and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids,
of which dronabinol is a specific example, for the treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea). Dronabinol
is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as  9-THC ( 9-tetrahydrocannabinol).
Pier s business plan was to determine whether dronabinol would significantly improve subjective and objective clinical measures
in patients with OSA. In addition, Pier intended to evaluate the feasibility and comparative efficacy of a proprietary formulation
of dronabinol.  

Dronabinol
is a Schedule III, controlled generic drug with a relatively low abuse potential that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(the  FDA ) for the treatment of AIDS-related anorexia and chemotherapy-induced emesis. The use of dronabinol for
the treatment of OSA is a novel indication for an already approved drug and, as such, the Company believes that it would only
require approval by the FDA of a 505(b)(2) application, as opposed to the submission and approval of a full new drug application.  

The
2007 License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013, due to the Company s failure to make a required payment.
Subsequently, current management opened negotiations with the University of Illinois, and as a result, the Company ultimately
entered into a new license agreement (the  2014 License Agreement ) with the University of Illinois on June 27, 2014,
the material terms of which were similar to the 2007 License Agreement.  

Similar
to the 2007 License Agreement, the 2014 License Agreement grants the Company, among other provisions, exclusive rights: (i) to
practice certain patents and patent applications, as defined in the 2014 License Agreement, that are held by the University of
Illinois; (ii) to identify, develop, make, have made, import, export, lease, sell, have sold or offer for sale any related licensed
products; and (iii) to grant sub-licenses of the rights granted in the 2014 License Agreement, subject to the provisions of the
2014 License Agreement. The Company is required under the 2014 License Agreement, among other terms and conditions, to pay the
University of Illinois a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain milestone payments.  

Clinical
Trial Developments   

The
University of Illinois and three other research centers recently completed a six week, placebo-controlled Phase 2B clinical trial
investigating the effects of dronabinol in patients with OSA. The Company did not manage or fund this clinical trial; this clinical
trial was fully funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and is being managed
by University of Illinois researchers. The Company has received a copy of the Final Progress Report (the  Project Report )
with respect to this clinical trial entitled  Cannabimimetic treatment of obstructive sleep apnea: A proof of concept trial ,
grant number 5UM1HL112856.  

The
Project Report describes preliminary data from three groups of patients who received either of two doses of dronabinol (2.5 or
10 mg) or placebo. The identities of the groups described in the Project Report remain blinded, but the Project Report indicates
that significant group differences were observed in three of four primary outcome measures, including the Apnea-Hypopnea Index
(AHI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Unblinding of the group identities is expected to occur when the investigators have
completed all planned primary and secondary analyses. The investigators have indicated that they  anticipate submitting
an abstract detailing at least the top-line findings in December 2016, for presentation at the  Sleep 2017  international
conference of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.  The investigators also stated they anticipate that they  will
submit a peer-review manuscript detailing these findings in the Winter of 2017.   

In
addition to the dronabinol clinical trial, the Company filed an Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application with
the FDA in September 2015 to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending Phase 2A clinical trial in approximately
18 subjects to determine the ability of orally administered CX1739, the Company s proprietary lead ampakine, to prevent
the respiratory depression produced by remifentanil, a potent opioid, without altering remifentanil s analgesic properties.
The clinical protocol was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three escalating doses of CX1739 versus placebo when
administered prior to remifentanil, with respiration, analgesia and a number of other clinical measures being taken after administration
of both drugs. During March 2016, upon receiving unconditional approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Duke Clinical
Research Unit, this Phase 2A clinical trial at Duke University School of Medicine was initiated. The dosing and data accumulation
phase of the clinical trial was completed in June 2016 and the clinical trial was formally completed on July 11, 2016.  

On
September 12, 2016, the Company issued a press release announcing preliminary top-line analysis of safety and efficacy data from
this clinical trial. On October 3, 2016, the Company discovered an error in the data reported to it that the Company believes
will affect the efficacy data analysis. At this time, the Company does not know the extent of the effect, but the safety data
is expected to remain unchanged. Accordingly, on October 4, 2016, the Company issued a press release retracting the efficacy data
contained in the September 12, 2016 press release. The Company is continuing to work with the Duke University clinical research
team to analyze the data collected. The Company expects that a revised top-line analysis of the respiratory data will be completed
by the end of November 2016 and to issue a final report on the results of the clinical trial by the end of December 2016.  

The
Company currently expects to incur a total of approximately $978,000 of direct and indirect costs in 2016 with respect to this
clinical trial (including approximately $678,000 to Duke University), of which a total of approximately $261,000 and $720,000
was incurred during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  

Going
Concern    

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred
net losses of $7,804,002 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5,961,892 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015,
and had negative operating cash flows of $1,212,331 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,296,100 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015. The Company also had a stockholders  deficiency of $4,846,319 at September 30, 2016, and expects
to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has
concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2015, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is currently, and has for some time, been in significant financial distress. It has limited cash resources and current
assets and has no ongoing source of sustainable revenue. Management is continuing to address various aspects of the Company s
operations and obligations, including, without limitation, debt obligations, financing requirements, intellectual property, licensing
agreements, legal and patent matters and regulatory compliance, and has continued to raise new debt and equity capital to fund
the Company s business activities from both related and unrelated parties.  

The
Company is continuing efforts to raise additional capital in order to pay its liabilities, fund its business activities and underwrite
its research and development programs. The Company regularly evaluates various measures to satisfy the Company s liquidity
needs, including the development of agreements with collaborative partners and, when necessary, the exchange or restructuring
of the Company s outstanding securities. As a result of the Company s current financial situation, the Company has
limited access to external sources of debt and equity financing and has recently utilized short-term borrowings from its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Scientific Officer to fund operations, although there can be no assurances that such borrowings
will continue to be available. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing
in the amounts necessary to fund its operating and debt service requirements. If the Company is unable to access sufficient cash
resources on a timely basis, the Company may be forced to reduce or suspend operations indefinitely or to discontinue operations
entirely and liquidate.

Reverse
Stock Split   

On
August 16, 2016, at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s
Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to effect, at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, a three
hundred twenty five-to-one (325 to 1) reverse stock split of all of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, and (ii) to set the number of the Company s authorized shares of stock at 70,000,000 shares,
consisting of 65,000,000 shares designated as common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares designated as preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share. On September 1, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Second
Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the approved amendment.  

Pursuant
to the amendment, an aggregate of 191.068 fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were not issued, but are being
paid out in cash (without interest or deduction) in an amount equal to the number of shares exchanged into such fractional share
multiplied by the average closing trading price of the Company s common stock on the OTCQB for the five trading days immediately
before the Certificate of Amendment effecting the reverse stock split was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State ($6.7899
per share, on a post reverse stock split basis) for a total of $1,298.  

All
share and per share amounts with respect to common stock presented herein have been retroactively restated to reflect the 325
to 1 reverse stock split as if it had been effected on the first day of the earliest period presented. Certain share amounts have
been rounded to whole shares in the process of recording the effect of the reverse stock split.

instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents.
The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.  

The
Company s research and development efforts and potential products rely on licenses from research institutions and if the
Company loses access to these technologies or applications, its business could be substantially impaired.  

Under
a patent license agreement with The Governors of the University of Alberta, the Company has exclusive rights to the use of certain
ampakine compounds to prevent and treat respiratory depression induced by opioid analgesics, barbiturates and anesthetic and sedative
agents.  

On
May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting the
Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment
of various respiratory disorders. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta a licensing fee and a patent issuance fee,
which were paid, and prospective payments consisting of a royalty on net sales, sublicense fee payments, maintenance payments
and milestone payments. The prospective maintenance payments commence on the enrollment of the first patient into the first Phase
2B clinical trial and increase upon the successful completion of the Phase 2B clinical trial. As the Company does not at this
time anticipate scheduling a Phase 2B clinical trial, no maintenance payments are currently due and payable to the University
of Alberta. In addition, no other prospective payments are currently due and payable to the University of Alberta.  

Through
the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to the 2007 License Agreement that Pier had entered into with the University of
Illinois on October 10, 2007. The 2007 License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States
and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing
disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. Dronabinol is a synthetic
derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as  9-THC ( 9-tetrahydrocannabinol).
Dronabinol is currently approved by the FDA and is sold generically for use in refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,
as well as for anorexia in patients with AIDS. Pier s business plan was to determine whether dronabinol would significantly
improve subjective and objective clinical measures in patients with OSA. In addition, Pier intended to evaluate the feasibility
and comparative efficacy of a proprietary formulation of dronabinol. The 2007 License Agreement was terminated effective March
21, 2013 due to the Company s failure to make a required payment, and on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014
License Agreement with the University of Illinois, the material terms of which were similar to the 2007 License Agreement that
had been terminated. If the Company is unable to comply with the terms of the 2014 License Agreement, such as an inability to
make the payments required thereunder, the Company would be at risk of the 2014 License Agreement being terminated.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
Company prepared its condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management
periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience
and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
as a result of different assumptions or conditions.  

The
following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

Series
G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock    

The
Company accounted for the beneficial conversion features associated with the shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock
issued in 2014 in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 470-20, Accounting for Debt with Conversion
and Other Options. The Company calculated a deemed dividend on the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock of $8,376,719 in
March 2014 and $1,673,127 in April 2014, which equaled the amount by which the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable
upon conversion of the issued Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock exceeded the proceeds from such issuances. The deemed
dividend on the Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock was amortized on the straight-line basis from the respective issuance
dates through the earliest conversion date of June 16, 2014, in accordance with ASC 470-20. The difference between the amortization
of the deemed dividend calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

On
April 17, 2016, the remaining unconverted 259.7 shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding (including accrued
but unpaid dividends) were automatically and mandatorily redeemed by conversion into 242,173 newly issued shares of common stock
at a conversion price of $1.07250 per share.  

Convertible
Notes Payable    

The
Company accounted for the beneficial conversion features with respect to the sale of the convertible notes and the issuance of
the warrants in 2014 and 2015 in accordance with ASC 470-20, Accounting for Debt with Conversion and Other Options.  

The
Company considered the face value of the convertible notes to be representative of their fair value. The Company determined the
fair value of the warrants based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The relative fair value method generated respective
fair values for each of the convertible notes and the warrants of approximately 50% for the convertible notes and approximately
50% for the warrants sold with the convertible notes. Once these values were determined, the fair value of the warrants and the
fair value of the beneficial conversion feature (which were calculated based on the effective conversion price) were recorded
as a reduction to the face value of the promissory note obligation. As a result, this aggregate debt discount reduced the carrying
value of the convertible notes to zero at each issuance date. The excess amount generated from this calculation was not recorded,
as the carrying value of a convertible note cannot be reduced below zero. The aggregate debt discount was amortized as interest
expense over the original term of the convertible notes. The difference between the amortization of the debt discount calculated
based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

The
cash fees paid to placement agents and for legal costs incurred from November 5, 2014 through February 2, 2015 with respect to
this financing were deferred and capitalized as deferred offering costs and were amortized to interest expense over the original
term of the convertible notes through September 15, 2015 on the straight-line method. The placement agent warrants were considered
as an additional cost of the offering and were included in deferred offering costs at fair value. The difference between the amortization
of the deferred offering costs calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

On
August 13, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes, the Company elected to extend the maturity date of the convertible
notes to September 15, 2016. As a consequence of this election, under the terms of the convertible notes, the Company was required
to issue to convertible note holders additional warrants (the  New Warrants ). In connection with the extension of
the maturity date of the convertible notes, the Board of Directors of the Company determined to extend the termination date of
the original warrants, so that they were coterminous with the new maturity date of the convertible notes.  

The
Company reviewed the guidance in ASC 405-20, Extinguishment of Liabilities, and determined that the notes had not been extinguished.
The Company therefore concluded that the guidance in ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, should be applied, which states
that if the exchange or modification is not to be accounted for in the same manner as a debt extinguishment, then the fees shall
be associated with the replacement or modified debt instrument and, along with any existing unamortized premium or discount, amortized
as an adjustment of interest expense over the remaining term of the replacement or modified debt instrument using the interest
method.  

The
Company deferred the debt modification costs related to the modification of the convertible notes and the issuance of the New
Warrants (consisting of the fair value of the New Warrants) over the remaining term of the extended notes. The Company accounted
for such costs as a discount to the convertible notes and amortized such costs to interest expense over the extended term of the
convertible notes on the straight-line method. The difference between the amortization of these costs calculated based on the
straight-line method and the effective yield method was not material.  

The
Company deferred the debt modification costs related to the extension of the original warrants (consisting of the fair value of
the extension of the original warrants) over the remaining term of the extended convertible notes. The Company accounted for such
costs as a discount to the convertible notes and amortized such costs to interest expense over the extended term of the convertible
notes on the straight-line method. The difference between the amortization of these costs calculated based on the straight-line
method and the effective yield method was not material.  

The
closing market price of the Company s common stock on the extension date of September 15, 2015 was $10.075 per share, as
compared to the fixed conversion price of the convertible notes and the fixed exercise price of both the original warrants and
the New Warrants of $11.375 per share. The Company accounted for the beneficial conversion features with respect to the extension
of the convertible notes and the extension of the original warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants in accordance with ASC
470-20, Accounting for Debt with Conversion and Other Options.  

The
Company considered the face value of the convertible notes, plus the accrued interest thereon, to be representative of their fair
value. The relative fair value method generated respective fair values for each of the convertible notes, including accrued interest,
and the New Warrants and extension of the original warrants, of approximately 55% for the convertible notes, including accrued
interest, and approximately 45% for the New Warrants and extension of the original warrants. Once these values were determined,
the fair value of the New Warrants and extension of the original warrants and the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature
(which were calculated based on the effective conversion price) were recorded as a reduction to the face value of the promissory
note obligation. The aggregate debt discount was amortized as interest expense over the extended term of the promissory notes.
The difference between the amortization of the debt discount calculated based on the straight-line method and the effective yield
method was not material.  

During
April and May 2016, the Company entered into Note Exchange Agreements with certain note holders, representing an aggregate of
$303,500 of principal amount of the convertible notes (out of a total of $579,500 of original principal amount of the convertible
notes payable). The Note Exchange Agreements were substantially similar, and provided for the note holders to exchange their notes,
original warrants and New Warrants (collectively, the  Exchanged Securities ), plus cash, in exchange for shares of
the Company s common stock. In the aggregate, $344,483 of principal amount (which included accrued interest of $40,983)
of the convertible notes, original warrants to purchase 26,681 shares of the Company s common stock and New Warrants to
purchase 14,259 shares of the Company s common stock, plus an aggregate of $232,846 in cash, were exchanged for 101,508
shares of the Company s common stock, with a total market value of $631,023 (average $6.2075 per share), which resulted
in a credit to total stockholders  equity of $577,329. All of the Exchanged Securities were cancelled as a result of the
respective exchange transactions.  

The
Company reviewed the guidance in ASC 470-20-40-13 through 17, Recognition of Expense Upon Conversion, and in ASC 470-20-40-26,
Induced Conversions. Pursuant to this accounting guidance, for those convertible note holders accepting the Company s exchange
offer, the Company evaluated the fair value of the incremental consideration paid to induce conversion of the convertible notes
into equity (i.e., 30,284 shares of common stock), based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the
date of each transaction, and recorded a charge to operations of $188,274.  

The
Company evaluated the warrants exchanged in conjunction with the Note Exchange Agreements. The Company calculated the fair value
of the warrants exchanged (consisting of the warrants issued in conjunction with the original issuance of the convertible notes)
as if the warrants were modified immediately before the theoretical warrant modification and immediately after such warrant modification.
As the fair value of the warrants immediately after the modifications was less than the fair value of the warrants immediately
before the modifications (both amounts calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model), the Company did not record
any accounting entry with respect to the warrant exchange agreements.  

Unit
Exchange Agreements    

During
April and May 2016, the Company entered into Unit Exchange Agreements with certain warrant holders. The Unit Exchange Agreements
were substantially similar, and provided for the warrant holders to exchange (i) existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of
217,187 shares of the Company s common stock (which were cancelled as a result of the respective exchange transactions),
plus (ii) an aggregate of $529,394 in cash, in return for (i) an aggregate of 108,594 shares of the Company s common stock,
and (ii) new warrants to purchase an aggregate of 108,594 shares of the Company s common stock. The new warrants have the
same expiration date as the original warrants (September 30, 2020) and may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at $4.875
per share.  

The
Company evaluated the warrants exchanged in conjunction with the Unit Exchange Agreements. The Company calculated the fair value
of the warrants exchanged as if the warrants were modified immediately before the theoretical warrant modification and immediately
after such warrant modification. As the fair value of the warrants immediately after the modification was less than the fair value
of the warrants immediately before the modification (both amounts calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model),
the Company did not record any accounting entry with respect to the warrant exchange agreements.  

Research
Grants    

The
Company recognizes revenues from research grants as earned based on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and issues
invoices for contract amounts billed based on the terms of the grant agreement. Amounts recorded under research grants in excess
of amounts earned are classified as unearned grant revenue liability in the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Grant
receivable reflects contractual amounts due and payable under the grant agreement. The payment of grants receivable are based
on progress reports provided to the grant provider by the Company. The research grant was completed in April 2015. The Company
has filed all required progress reports.  

Research
grants are generally funded and paid through government or institutional programs. Amounts received under research grants are
nonrefundable, regardless of the success of the underlying research project, to the extent that such amounts are expended in accordance
with the approved grant project.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors, Scientific Advisory Board members and consultants
for services rendered. Such issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers and directors by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis in the Company s financial statements over the vesting period of the awards. The Company accounts for stock-based
payments to Scientific Advisory Board members and consultants by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon the
measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or (b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.  

Stock
grants, which are generally subject to time-based vesting, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations
ratably over the vesting period.  

Stock
options granted to members of the Company s Scientific Advisory Board and to outside consultants are revalued each reporting
period until vested to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the stock options vest,
they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the
value on the date of vesting.  

The
fair value of stock options is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is affected by several variables,
the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the security as compared to the fair market
value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award.
Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of common stock is determined by reference
to the quoted market price of the Company s common stock.  

Stock
options and warrants issued to non-employees as compensation for services to be provided to the Company or in settlement of debt
are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair value of the stock option or warrant,
whichever can be more clearly determined. Management used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of
the stock options and warrants issued by the Company. The Company recognizes this expense over the period in which the services
are provided.  

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company issues new shares of
common stock to satisfy stock option exercises.  

Research
and Development    

Research
and development costs include compensation paid to management directing the Company s research and development activities,
and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers and organizations (including research institutes at universities),
patent fees and costs, and other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development and testing of the Company s
treatments and product candidates.  

Research
and development costs incurred by the Company under research grants are expensed as incurred over the life of the underlying contracts,
unless the terms of the contract indicate that a different expensing schedule is more appropriate.  

The
Company reviews the status of its research and development contracts on a quarterly basis.  

License
Agreements    

Obligations
incurred with respect to mandatory payments provided for in license agreements are recognized ratably over the appropriate period,
as specified in the underlying license agreement, and are recorded as liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated
balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Obligations incurred with respect to milestone payments provided for in license agreements are recognized when
it is probable that such milestone will be reached, and are recorded as liabilities in the Company s condensed consolidated
balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Payments of such liabilities are made in the ordinary course of business.  

Patent
Costs    

Due
to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on
the Company s research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal and
filing fees, are expensed as incurred.  

Results
of Operations   

The
Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations as discussed herein are presented below.  

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues .
During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no research grant revenues.  

General
and Administrative . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $1,349,970, a
decrease of $266,533, as compared to $1,616,503 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an decrease in
stock-based compensation of $450,849, partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $62,430, an increase
in investor relation costs of $28,756, an increase in transfer agent costs of $22,185, and a credit during the three months ended
September 30, 2015 for the reversal of previously over-accrued liabilities in the amount of $55,778.  

Stock-based
compensation costs included in general and administrative expenses were $837,630 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $1,288,479 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting a decrease of $450,849. The decrease in stock-based
compensation consists primarily of the immediate cost of fully vested options in the amount of $893,354 that were granted to the
Company s Chief Executive Officer upon his joining the Company on August 18, 2015, partially offset by the incremental amortization
of costs relating to other stock options granted to members of management, the Company s Board of Directors and to outside
consultants on March 31, 2016. Salaries and employee benefits included in general and administrative expenses were $211,950 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $149,520 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an
increase of $62,430. The net change in compensation reflects the Company s shift in compensation philosophy for its officers
beginning in August 2015 from entirely stock-based compensation to a combination of stock-based compensation and compensation
payable in cash (subject to certain conditions), as well as a restructuring of and shift in the responsibilities of certain officers
between corporate activities and research and development activities. Investor relations expenses included in general and administrative
expenses were $37,926 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $9,170 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $28,756. Transfer agent fees included in general and administrative expenses were $26,880
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4,695 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting
an increase of $22,185, due primarily to the reverse split of the Company s common stock.  

Research
and Development . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expenses were $899,543, an increase
of $493,801, as compared to $405,742 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily a result
of an increase in stock-based compensation of $223,075, an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $55,861, and an increase
in contractual clinical research expenditures of $263,989, primarily related to the Company s Phase 2A clinical trial of
CX1739, offset by a decrease of $44,288 in patent related costs.  

Stock-based
compensation costs included in research and development expenses were $328,462 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $105,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $223,075. The increase in stock-based
compensation reflects the amortization of costs relating to stock options granted to members of management and to outside consultants
engaged in research and development activities. Salaries and employee benefits included in research and development expenses were
$93,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $38,039 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting
an increase of $55,861. The net change in compensation reflects the Company s shift in compensation philosophy for its officers
beginning in August 2015 from entirely stock-based compensation to a combination of stock-based compensation and compensation
payable in cash (subject to certain conditions), as well as a restructuring of and shift in the responsibilities of certain officers
between corporate activities and research and development activities.  

Contractual
research expenditures included in research and development expenses were $321,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $57,921 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $263,990. The net change in contractual
clinical research expenditures reflects the Company s accelerating clinical trial program.  

Gain
from Settlements with Service Providers . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of
$1,076 as a result of an agreement with a current service provider that resulted in the partial settlement of amounts owed to
it by the Company. An obligation in the amount of $32,250 was settled by the issuance of stock options to purchase 7,222 shares
of common stock (exercisable at the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of issuance) valued pursuant
to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at $31,174.  

Interest
Expense . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense was $115,847 (which included $47,057 to related
parties), a decrease of $137,254, as compared to $253,101 (which included $712 to related parties) for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The net decrease in interest expense of $137,254 consists of a decrease of $174,980 in the amortization of
debt discounts and capitalized financing costs associated with the convertible note financing and subsequent extension, partially
offset by an increase of $44,303 attributable to the fair value of fully vested warrants issued to the Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Scientific Officer in connection with working capital loans made to the Company during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. The amortization of debt discounts (including the beneficial conversion feature) and capitalized financing
costs charged to interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 aggregated $48,557, as compared to $223,537
during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Foreign
Currency Transaction Gain (Loss) . Foreign currency transaction loss was $27,518 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to a foreign currency transaction gain of $11,618 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The foreign currency
transaction loss relates to the $399,774 loan from SY Corporation made in June 2012, which is denominated in the South Korean
Won.  

Net
Loss . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,391,802, as compared to a net loss
of $2,263,728 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Dividends
on Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no dividends accrued
on the shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock issued in the March 18, 2014 and the April 17, 2014. For the three
months ended September 30, 2015, dividends accrued on the shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock issued in the March
18, 2014 and April 17, 2014 closings were $1,108. The decrease in dividends accrued on the shares of Series G 1.5% Convertible
Preferred Stock of $1,108 is due to conversions of Series G 1.5% Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock that have occurred
since issuance in 2014, including the automatic and mandatory conversion of all remaining unconverted shares on April 17, 2016.  

Net
Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss attributable
to common stockholders of $2,391,802, as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $2,264,836 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues .
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had research grant revenues of $0 and $86,916, respectively.
The research grant revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were related to a contract with the National Institute
of Drug Abuse entered into on September 18, 2014 and completed in early 2015.  

General
and Administrative . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $4,272,215, an
increase of $1,625,419, as compared to $2,646,796 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in
stock-based compensation of $1,094,669, an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $298,786, an increase in professional
and consulting fees of $53,205, an increase in investor relation costs of $54,456, an increase in transfer agent costs of $22,701,
and a credit during the three months ended September 30, 2015 for the reversal of previously over-accrued liabilities in the amount
of $55,778.  

Stock-based
compensation costs included in general and administrative expenses were $2,821,748 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $1,727,079 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $1,094,669. The increase in
stock-based compensation reflects the amortization of costs relating to stock options granted to members of management, the Company s
Board of Directors and to outside consultants. The immediate cost of fully vested options in the amount of $893,354 that were
granted to the Company s Chief Executive Officer upon his joining the Company on August 18, 2015 are included in general
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Salaries and employee benefits included in general and
administrative expenses were $643,306 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $344,520 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $298,786. The net change reflects the Company s shift in compensation
philosophy for its officers beginning in August-2015 from entirely stock-based compensation to a combination of stock-based compensation
and compensation payable in cash (subject to certain conditions), as well as a restructuring of and shift in the responsibilities
of certain officers between corporate activities and research and development activities. Professional and other consulting fees
included in general and administrative expenses were $566,771 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $513,566
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $53,205, due primarily to preparation of the Company s

expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily a

as compared to $250,787 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $878,739. The increase in stock-based
compensation reflects the amortization of costs relating to stock options granted to members of management and to outside consultants
engaged in research and development activities. Salaries and employee benefits included in research and development expenses were
$254,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $73,703 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting
an increase of $180,997. The net change reflects the Company s shift in compensation philosophy for its officers beginning
in August 2015 from entirely stock-based compensation to a combination of stock-based compensation and compensation payable in
cash (subject to certain conditions), as well as a restructuring of and shift in the responsibilities of certain officers between
corporate activities and research and development activities.  

Contractual
research expenditures included in research and development expenses were $902,901 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
as compared to $324,434 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting an increase of $578,467. The net change in contractual

such that $3,000 of the remaining balance due was extended to September 30, 2015, with the remaining balance of $12,500 extended

years. The stock options granted on June 29, 2015 were valued pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at $840, which

shares of the Company s common stock, with a total market value of $631,023 (average $6.2075 per share). Accordingly, during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a cost of $188,274, reflecting the fair value of the inducement
to effect the exchange of a portion the convertible notes payable (together with original warrants, New Warrants and cash) for
shares of the Company s common stock.  

Interest
Expense . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense was $562,053 (which included $148,046 to related
parties), a decrease of $189,015, as compared to $751,068 (which included $877 to related parties) for the nine months ended September

and capitalized financing costs associated with the convertible note financing and subsequent extension, offset by an increase
of $140,939 attributable to the fair value of fully vested warrants issued to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   September 30, 2016   

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred
net losses of $7,804,002 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5,961,892 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015,
and had negative operating cash flows of $1,212,331 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1,296,100 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, had a stockholders  deficiency of $4,846,319 at September 30, 2016, and expects to continue
to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has concluded that
there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2015, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
(see  Going Concern  above).  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $4,889,965, as compared to a working capital deficit of $2,922,279
at December 31, 2015, reflecting an increase in the working capital deficit of $1,967,686 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. The increase in the working capital deficit during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised of an increase
in total current liabilities of $2,038,954, partially offset by an increase in current assets of $71,268. The increase in total
current liabilities of $2,038,954 consists of a net increase in notes payable of $282,394, including an increase in notes payable
to officers of $162,306, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1,756,560, including an increase in accrued
compensation of $927,300.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash aggregating $39,553, as compared to $53,199 at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease
in cash of $13,646 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company is currently, and has for some time, been in significant financial distress. It has limited cash resources and current
assets and has no ongoing source of sustainable revenue. Management is continuing to address numerous aspects of the Company s
operations and obligations, including, without limitation, debt obligations, financing requirements, intellectual property, licensing
agreements, legal and patent matters and regulatory compliance, and has continued to raise new debt and equity capital to fund
the Company s business activities.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $276,000 principal amount of convertible notes payable outstanding (plus accrued interest
of $54,528), which had matured and become due and payable on demand on September 15, 2016. During October 2016, holders of four
Notes totaling $73,004, which included accrued interest of $12,004 at September 30, 2016, issued formal notices of default, and
as a result, those four Notes were deemed to be in default under the terms of the Notes and began to accrue interest at the default
rate of 12% per annum from the default date in accordance with the terms of the Notes. The Company is continuing efforts to satisfy
these notes payable through the issuance of the Company s securities, although there can be no assurances that the Company
will be successful in this regard.  

The
Company is continuing efforts to raise additional capital in order to pay its liabilities, fund its business activities and underwrite
its research and development programs. The Company regularly evaluates various measures to satisfy the Company s liquidity
needs, including the development of agreements with collaborative partners and, when necessary, the exchange or restructuring
of the Company s outstanding securities. As a result of the Company s current financial situation, the Company has
limited access to external sources of debt and equity financing and has recently utilized short-term borrowings from its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Scientific Officer to fund operations, although there can be no assurances that such borrowings
will continue to be available. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing
in the amounts necessary to fund its operating and debt service requirements. If the Company is unable to access sufficient cash
resources on a timely basis, the Company may be forced to reduce or suspend operations indefinitely or to discontinue operations
entirely and liquidate.

Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating activities utilized cash of $1,212,331, as compared to

proceeds from the convertible note and warrant financing and $40,000 in proceeds from a note payable issued to the Company s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, offset by principal paid on other notes payable of $21,491, the payment of financing costs
of $91,586 relating to various financings and the repayment of the $40,000 note payable from the Company s Chairman and

the first market approval is obtained from the FDA and until the first sale of a product, the minimum annual royalty will increase
to $200,000. In the year after the first commercial sale of a product, the minimum annual royalty will increase to $250,000.  

The
2014 License Agreement also provides for certain one-time milestone payments by the Company. A payment of $75,000 is due within
five days after any one of the following: (a) dosing of the first patient with a product in a Phase 2 human clinical study anywhere
in the world that is not sponsored by the University of Illinois, (b) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 human clinical
study anywhere in the world with a low dose of dronabinol, or (c) dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 human clinical study
anywhere in the world with a proprietary reformulation of dronabinol. A payment of $350,000 is due within five days after dosing
of the first patient with a product in a Phase 3 human clinical trial anywhere in the world. A payment of $500,000 is due within
five days after the first new drug application filing with the FDA or a foreign equivalent for a product. A payment of $1,000,000
is due within 12 months after the first commercial sale of a product.  

During
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $25,000 and
$75,000, respectively, with respect to its 2016 and 2015 minimum annual royalty obligation, which is included in research and
development expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. If the Company is unable to make the 2016 minimum annual royalty payment of $100,000 in December
2016, such non-payment could result in the cancellation of the 2014 License Agreement.  

Research
Contract with the University of Alberta    

On
January 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Research Contract with the University of Alberta in order to test the efficacy of
ampakines at a variety of dosage and formulation levels in the potential treatment of Pompe Disease, apnea of prematurity and
spinal cord injury, as well as to conduct certain electrophysiological studies to explore the ampakine mechanism of action for
central respiratory depression. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta total consideration of approximately CAD$146,000
(approximately US$111,000), consisting of approximately CAD$85,000 (approximately US$65,000) of personnel funding in cash in four
installments during 2016, to provide approximately CAD$21,000 (approximately US$16,000) in equipment, to pay patent costs of CAD$20,000
(approximately US$15,000), and to underwrite additional budgeted costs of CAD$20,000 (approximately US$15,000). As of September
30, 2016, CAD$21,250 (approximately US$16,150) remained payable under this agreement and is included in accounts payable and accrued
expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. The conversion to US dollars above
utilizes an exchange rate of US$0.76 for every CAD$1.00.  

The
University of Alberta will receive matching funds through a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in support of
the research. The Company will retain the rights to research results and any patentable intellectual property generated by the
research. Dr. John Greer, Chairman of the Company s Scientific Advisory Board and faculty member of the Department of Physiology,
Perinatal Research Centre and Women   Children s Health Research Institute, and Alberta Innovates - Health Sciences
Senior Scientist with the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute at the University of Alberta, will collaborate on this research.
The studies are expected to be completed in 2016.  

National
Institute of Drug Abuse Agreement    

On
January 19, 2016, the Company announced that that it has reached an agreement with the Medications Development Program of the
National Institute of Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) to conduct research on the Company s ampakine compounds CX717 and
CX1739. The agreement was entered into as of October 19, 2015, and on January 14, 2016, the Company and NIDA approved the proposed
protocols, allowing research activities to commence.  

NIDA
will evaluate the compounds using pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic and toxicologic protocols to determine the potential effectiveness
of the ampakines for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction. Initial studies will focus on cocaine and methamphetamine addiction

The Company will provide NIDA with supplies of CX717 and CX1739 and will work with the NIDA staff to refine the protocols and
dosing parameters. The Company will retain all intellectual property, as well as proprietary and commercialization rights to these
compounds.

University Clinical Trial Agreement    

On
January 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Clinical Study and Research Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Duke University
to develop and conduct a protocol for a program of clinical study and research at a total cost of $50,579, which was completed
in March 2015 and charged to research and development expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2015. On October 30, 2015,
the Agreement was amended to provide for a Phase 2A clinical trial of CX1739 at a cost of $558,268. During March 2016, a Phase
2A clinical trial at Duke University School of Medicine was initiated, with the dosing portion of the clinical trial completed
in June 2016 and the clinical trial formally completed on July 11, 2016. On July 28, 2016, the Agreement was further amended to
reflect additional post-clinical trial costs of $120,059, increasing the total amount payable under the Agreement to $678,327.

Not

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

The
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, consisting of its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, consisting of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company failed to complete and file various periodic reports in 2012,
2013 and 2014 in a timely manner because the Company s accounting and financial staff had resigned by October 26, 2012 and
its financial and accounting systems had been shut-down at December 31, 2012.  

Current
management, which joined the Company in March and April 2013, has been focusing on developing replacement controls and procedures
that are adequate to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
consisting of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Current management has instituted a program to reestablish the Company s accounting and financial staff
and install new accounting and internal control systems, and has retained accounting personnel, established accounting and internal
control systems, addressed the preparation of delinquent financial statements, and worked diligently to bring delinquent SEC filings
current as promptly as reasonably possible under the circumstances. The Company is now current in its SEC periodic reporting obligations,
but as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company had not yet completed the process to establish
adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  

The
Company s management, consisting of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that
its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Management
believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

The
Company s management, consisting of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has determined that
no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during or subsequent to the end of the period covered in this report that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

By
letter dated November 11, 2014, a former director of the Company, who joined the Company s Board of Directors on August
10, 2012 in conjunction with the Pier transaction and who resigned from the Company s Board of Directors on September 28,
2012, asserted a claim for unpaid consulting compensation of $24,000. The Company has not received any further communications
from the former director with respect to this matter.  

By
letter dated February 5, 2016, the Company received a demand from a law firm representing a professional services vendor of the
Company alleging that approximately $146,000 is due and owing for unpaid services rendered. This claim has been scheduled for
arbitration on December 15, 2016.  

By
e-mail dated July 21, 2016, the Company received a demand from an investment banking consulting firm that represented the Company
in 2012 in conjunction with the Pier transaction alleging that $225,000 is due and owing for unpaid investment banking services
rendered. The Company has been in discussions with this firm regarding this matter.  

The
Company is periodically the subject of various pending and threatened legal actions and claims. In the opinion of management of
the Company, adequate provision has been made in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 with respect to such matters, including, specifically, the matters noted above. The Company intends
to vigorously defend itself if any of the matters described above results in the filing of a lawsuit or formal claim.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

As
of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).
The Risk Factors set forth in the 2015 Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating the Company s business
and in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described
in the 2015 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results and
the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. These are not the only risks that the Company faces.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results.  

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

On
August 16, 2016, at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s
Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to effect, at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, a three
hundred twenty five-to-one (325 to 1) reverse stock split of all of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, and (ii) to set the number of the Company s authorized shares of stock at 70,000,000 shares,
consisting of 65,000,000 shares designated as common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares designated as preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share. On September 1, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Second
Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the approved amendment.  

Pursuant
to the amendment, an aggregate of 191.068 fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were not issued, but are being
paid out in cash (without interest or deduction) in an amount equal to the number of shares exchanged into such fractional share
multiplied by the average closing trading price of the Company s common stock on the OTCQB for the five trading days immediately
before the Certificate of Amendment effecting the reverse stock split was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State ($6.7899
per share, on a post reverse stock split basis) for a total of $1,298.  

On
September 2, 2016, the Company issued a stock option to purchase 7,222 shares of its common stock in partial payment of consulting
fees to one of its professional service providers. The stock option was fully vested on the date of grant and will expire on September
2, 2021. The exercise price of the stock option was established on the grant date at $4.50 per share, which was the closing market
price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The aggregate grant date fair value of the stock option, calculated
pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was determined to be $31,174. The issuance of the stock option resulted in
a gain to the Company of $1,076 during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

On
September 12, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement for consulting services, which provided for the payment of a fee through
the granting of a non-qualified stock option to purchase a total of 2,608 shares of common stock pursuant to the Company s
2015 Plan. The stock option was fully vested on the date of grant and will expire on September 12, 2021. The exercise price of
the stock option was established on the grant date at $5.7500 per share, which was the closing market price of the Company s
common stock on the date of grant. The aggregate grant date fair value of the stock option, calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, was $14,384, which was charged to operations on the date of grant.  

On
September 22, 2016, Dr. James S. Manuso, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
advanced $25,000 to the Company for working capital purposes under a demand promissory note with interest at 10% per annum. The
note was secured by the assets of the Company. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $55 was charged
to interest expense with respect to the note. In connection with the loan, Dr. Manuso was issued a fully vested warrant to purchase
5,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $5.0000 per share, which was the closing market price
of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The warrant expires on September 22, 2019 and may be exercised on a
cashless basis. The aggregate grant date fair value of the warrant, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, was determined to be $22,151, and was charged to interest expense as additional consideration for the loan during the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

On
September 23, 2016, Dr. Arnold S. Lippa, the Company s Chief Scientific Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors,
advanced $25,000 to the Company for working capital purposes under a demand promissory note with interest at 10% per annum. The
note was secured by the assets of the Company. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $48 was charged
to interest expense with respect to the note. In connection with the loan, Dr. Lippa was issued a fully vested warrant to purchase
5,155 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $4.8500 per share, which was the closing market price
of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The warrant expires on September 23, 2019 and may be exercised on a
cashless basis. The aggregate grant date fair value of the warrant, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, was determined to be $22,152, and was charged to interest expense as additional consideration for the loan during the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
securities issued in each of the above transactions were exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, because none of such transactions involved a public offering.  

ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES   

Note
Payable to SY Corporation Co., Ltd.     

On
June 25, 2012, the Company borrowed 465,000,000 Won (the currency of South Korea, equivalent to approximately $400,000 United
States Dollars) from and executed a secured note payable to SY Corporation Co., Ltd., formerly known as Samyang Optics Co. Ltd.
( SY Corporation ), an approximately 20% common stockholder of the Company at that time. SY Corporation was a significant
stockholder and a related party at the time of the transaction, but has not been a significant stockholder or related party of
the Company subsequent to December 31, 2015. The note accrues simple interest at the rate of 12% per annum and had a maturity
date of June 25, 2013. The Company has not made any payments on the promissory note. At June 30, 2013 and subsequently, the promissory
note was outstanding and in default, although SY Corporation has not issued a notice of default or a demand for repayment. The
Company believes that SY Corporation is in default of its obligations under its January 2012 license agreement, as amended, with
the Company, but the Company has not yet issued a notice of default. The Company is continuing efforts towards a comprehensive
resolution of the aforementioned matters involving SY Corporation.  

Note
payable to SY Corporation consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Interest
expense with respect to this promissory note was $12,092 and $12,260 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $36,013 and $36,379 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Default
on Convertible Notes Payable    

On
September 15, 2016, the remaining outstanding Notes previously issued by the Company on November 5, 2014, December 9, 2014, December
31, 2014, and February 2, 2015, matured and the principal and accrued interest under those remaining Notes became due and payable
upon demand. At the September 15, 2016 maturity date, Notes totaling $329,261, which included accrued interest of $53,261, became
due and payable upon demand. During October 2016, holders of four Notes totaling $73,004, which included accrued interest of $12,004
at September 30, 2016, issued formal notices of default, and as a result, those four Notes were deemed to be in default under
the terms of the Notes and began to accrue interest at the default rate of 12% per annum from the default date in accordance with
the terms of the Notes.
