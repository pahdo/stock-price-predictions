  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 AND 2015  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Original Source Entertainment, Inc. (the
 Company ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009 ( Inception ). The Company s
intent is to license songs to the television and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies. The Company has
had limited activity and revenue to date. 

Basis of Presentation  

 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company s
year-end is December 31. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Information  

 The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information, and with the rules
and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are,
in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim
results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained
in the information as part of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. 

Discontinued Operation  

 On February 5, 2014, the board of directors
of the Company authorized the spin-off of Original Source Music, Inc. ( Original Source Music ), the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary which holds all of its operations, to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. The spin-off was
done in connection with a change of control of Original Source Entertainment. Under the terms of the spin-off, Original Source
Music s common shares, par value $0.001 per share, will be distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of the Company s
common shares on the record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of Original Source
Entertainment s common shares as of the record date will become owners of 100 percent of Original Source Music s common
shares. 

On May 13, 2016, the spin-off was completed
due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Form 10 of Original Source
Music and the Form 10 s effectiveness 

Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

6  

Income Taxes  

 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted
tax rates. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the available evidence about future taxable income and other
possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets
to an amount that represents management s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not
will be realized. 

Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per
Share  

 The Company computes earnings (loss) per
share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45  Earnings per Share , which requires presentation of both basic and diluted
earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings
(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.  Diluted
earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive earnings
(loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did have potentially dilutive debt instruments outstanding that has been excluded from the earnings
per share calculation, as such an inclusion would have been anti-dilutive due to losses incurred by the Company in both period
and, therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal in both periods. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

We have reviewed all the recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact
on the Company other than those relating to Development Stage Entities as discussed above. 

NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN  

The Company has suffered a loss from operations
and has negative cash flows from operations, and in all likelihood will be required to make significant future expenditures in
connection with marketing efforts along with general administrative expenses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company may raise additional capital
through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions
or related parties. By doing so, the Company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its business plan of licensing songs
to the television and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies on an ongoing basis. Management believes that
actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 3. ADVANCES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY  

In support of the Company s efforts
and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations
or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment
for continued support by shareholders.  Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances
are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. 

7  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the amount outstanding was $66,429 and $52,652, respectively. The advances are non-interest bearing, due upon demand and
unsecured.  

NOTE   4. SPIN-OFF  

On February 5, 2014, the board of directors
of Original Source Entertainment authorized the spin-off of the Company to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. The
spin-off was done in connection with a change of control of Original Source Entertainment. Under the terms of the spin-off, the
Company s common shares, par value $0.001 per share, will be distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of Original Source
Entertainment s common shares on the record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the
holders of Original Source Entertainment s common shares as of the record date will become owners of 100 percent of our common
shares. 

On May 13, 2016, the spin-off was
completed due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Form 10 and the
Form 10 s effectiveness. 

The prior financial statements have been
revised to reflect the completed spin-off. 

NOTE 5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

In accordance with ASC 855-10,  Subsequent
Events  the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to September 30, 2016 to the date these financial statements were
available to be issued. During this period, we did not have any significant subsequent events. 

8  

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward-looking Statements  

Statements in this Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, as well as in certain other parts of this quarterly report on Form
10-Q (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Original Source) that
look forward in time, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives,
goals, strategies, future events or performance, expectations, predictions, and assumptions and other statements which are other
than statements of historical facts. Although Original Source believes such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give
no assurance that any forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to, and
are qualified by, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include,
but are not limited to Original Source s ability to estimate the impact of competition and of industry consolidation and
risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth in Original Source s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including without limitation to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Original Source undertakes no obligation
to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q. 

General  

 We were incorporated under the laws of
the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. We are a development stage company, and our business from inception through to May 13,
2016 was to license songs to the television and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies. We have had limited
activity and revenue to date. As of May 13, 2016, we spun-off Original Source Music, Inc. ( Original Source Music ),
our wholly-owned subsidiary which holds all of our operations, to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. The spin-off
was done in connection with a change of control of our company. Under the terms of the spin-off, Original Source Music s
common shares, par value $0.001 per share, will be distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of our common shares on the record
date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of our common shares as of the record date
will become owners of 100% of Original Source Music s common shares, subject to applicable FINRA filings. Accordingly, we
are a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, because we
have no a specific business plan and purpose. We do not have any definitive plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with
any representatives of the owners of any operating business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger, although
we will entertain such a possibility from time to time. 

We currently have no employees other than
our sole officer, who IS also our sole director. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The following discussion as well as disclosures
included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q are based upon our unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and accompanying notes
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

9  

The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies. Original Source continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates
used to prepare the financial statements. Original Source bases its estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed
to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. 

Trends and Uncertainties  

There are no material commitments for capital
expenditure at this time. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material
impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line
items of Original Source s financial statements. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we
have incurred losses of $39,368 and $43,793 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and have a working
capital deficiency which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management believes the Company will continue
to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or
debt financing to sustain its operations. 

Management plans to seek additional debt
and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms. 

The accompanying financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Results of Operations  

Three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, we earned revenues of $0. We had general and administrative expenses of $5,711. As a result, we had a net loss of $5,711
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

By comparison, during the three months
ended September 30, 2015, we earned revenues of $0. We paid general and administrative expenses of $2,589 and had a loss from discontinued
operations of $7,477. As a result, we had a net loss of $10,066 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The $4,355 decrease in net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily the result of the decrease
in loss from discontinued operations of $7,477 offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $3,122 primarily
from professional fees. 

10  

Nine Months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the Nine Months ended September 30, 2015  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we earned revenues of $0. We paid general and administrative expenses of $24,204 and incurred a loss from discontinued
operations of $15,164. As a result, we had a net loss of $39,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Comparatively, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, we earned revenues of $0. We paid general and administrative expenses of $22,087 as well as incurred a loss
from discontinued operations of $21,706. As a result, we had a net loss of $43,793 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The $4,425 decrease in net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, is primarily the result of the decrease
in loss from discontinued operations of $6,542 offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $2,117 primarily
from professional fees. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016,
we had a cash balance of $0. 

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Original
Source has incurred losses of $39,368 and $43,793 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a working
capital deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

On February 5, 2014, the board of directors
of the Company authorized the spin-off of Original Source Music, Inc. ( Original Source Music ), the Company s
wholly-owned subsidiary which holds all of its operations, to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. The spin-off was
done in connection with a change of control of Original Source Entertainment. Under the terms of the spin-off, Original Source
Music s common shares, par value $0.001 per share, will be distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of the Company s
common shares on the record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of Original Source
Entertainment s common shares as of the record date will become owners of 100 percent of Original Source Music s common
shares. 

On May 13, 2016, the spin-off was completed
due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Form 10 of Original Source
Music and the Form 10 s effectiveness, subject to applicable FINRA filings. Accordingly, as of such date, we no longer have
any operations or assets. 

Management believes the Company will continue
to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future, including as a result of the spin-off
of our operating business as of May 13, 2016, and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations and existence.
Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, either independently or in conjunction with a
business combination with a third party, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms. 

The Company s continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations,
and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a  going concern  qualification in their
auditors  report dated April 14, 2016. Such a  going concern  qualification may make it more difficult for us
to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured. 

11  

The accompanying financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Operating Activities   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we used $13,777 in operating activities compared to $23,876 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we incurred a loss of $39,368 which was partially offset for cash flow purposes by $15,617 in non-cash expenses and we
increased our balance of accounts payable and accrued liabilities by $4,625. By comparison, during the nine months ended September
30, 2015, we incurred losses of $43,793 which was partially offset for cash flow purposes by $15,260 in non-cash expenses and we
decreased our balance of accounts payable and accrued liabilities by $1,863. 

Investing Activities  

During
the  nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  and 2015, we did
not pursue any investing activities.  

Financing Activities   

During
the  nine months ended September 30, 2016,  we received $13,777 by
way of advances   related party. By comparison, we received $23,876 from advances   related party during the  nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Risk   

Not applicable for smaller reporting companies.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, as of  September 30, 2016 . Based on this
evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be ineffective
as of September 30 , 2016  to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
