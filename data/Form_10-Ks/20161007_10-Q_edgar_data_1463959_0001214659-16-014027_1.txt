Organization and Nature of Business 

DS Healthcare Group, Inc. (d/b/a DS Laboratories) (the  Company ,  DS Laboratories ,  DSKX ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was organized under the laws of the State of Florida in January 2007. Through its predecessors, the Company has been developing and marketing hair care, skin care and personal care products for over fifteen years. The Company has grown steadily over the last few years with a network of top specialty retailers and distributors throughout North America, Europe, Asia and South America. The Company researches and develops its own products, which management believes keeps the Company at the forefront of innovation. The Company utilizes two innovative technologies in its products, (1)  Liposome Technology , which acts as a carrier agent, and has been designed to enhance the action of the active ingredients in our products, and (2)  Nanosome Technology , which acts as a delivery vehicle, and has been designed to infuse active compounds into targeted cells for increased efficiency of our products. We currently offer products within the following broad product categories:  Hair Care, Skin Care and Personal Care.

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting where revenues and expenses are recognized in the period in which they were incurred. The basis of accounting conforms to US GAAP.

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its operating subsidiaries DS Laboratories, Inc., Sigma Development and Holding Co., Inc., Polaris Labs, Inc., Polymer Research, Inc., and Divine Skin Laboratories, S.A. de CV ( DS Mexico ). Also included in the condensed consolidated financial statements are the operating activities of Velocity Storage and Packaging, LLC, which are accounted for as VIEs. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

On March 30, 2016, During the preparation of the Company s 10-K, the company identified that certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the period ending September 30, 2015 became subject to an internal investigation.  The internal investigation resulted in the company s inability to timely file it s for 10-Q as required. 

The Company continued its review these transactions with its newly appointed independent accountants, the results of which have now been corrected and reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the three months period ending March 31, 2015.   The corrective actions identified errors related to sales and customer returns and allowances amounts with respect to the recognition of revenues and customer accounts receivables, and the recording of certain stock transactions.

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consulted with management and analyzed the adjustments. The company needs to correct the 2014 and 2015 10-Q filings to reflect these errors.  However, because of the above mentioned errors, the Audit Committee has directed the Company to conduct a thorough review of the financial records for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 along with its independent accountants and believes the financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 to be fairly presented.

Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual consolidated financial statements and related disclosures included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on October 7, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of those of a normal recurring nature) which are necessary to provide a fair presentation of financial position as of March 31, 2016 and the related operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been made.  The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or for the year ending December 31, 2016.

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its operating subsidiaries DS Laboratories, Inc., Sigma Development and Holding Co., Inc., Polaris Labs, Inc., Polymer Research, Inc., and Divine Skin Laboratories, S.A. de CV ( DS Mexico ). Also included in the condensed consolidated financial statements are the operating activities of Velocity Storage and Packaging, LLC, which are accounted for as VIEs. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

On March 30, 2016, During the preparation of the Company s 10-K, the company identified that certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the period ending September 30, 2015, became subject to an internal investigation.  The internal investigation resulted in the company s inability to timely file it s for 10-Q as required. 

The Company continued its review these transactions with its newly appointed independent accountants, the results of which have now been corrected and reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the three months ending March 31, 2015.   The corrective actions identified errors related to sales and customer returns and allowances amounts with respect to the recognition of revenues and customer accounts receivables, and the recording of certain stock transactions.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consulted with management and analyzed the adjustments. The company intends to correct the 2014 and 2015 10-Q filings to reflect these errors.  However, because of the above mentioned errors, the Audit Committee has directed the Company to conduct a thorough review of the financial records for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 along with its independent accountants and believes the financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 to be fairly presented.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions underlying these condensed consolidated financial statements include:

5 

Estimates of allowances for uncollectable accounts receivable, 

Estimates of inventory obsolescence and overhead and labor cost allocations, 

Estimates assuming future earning capacity of our intangible assets, 

Estimates of value of equity transactions for services rendered, 

Estimates of returned or damaged product, and 

Estimates made in our deferred income tax calculations, for which there is a full valuation allowance. 

Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. The Company also provides for allowances against accounts receivables for product returns and cooperative advertising allowances. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for uncollectable accounts was $662,284 and $663,161, respectively, $210,000 at both dates for defectives and product returns and $40,000 at both dates for advertising credits.

Inventories 

Inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market on the FIFO method. Our inventory is subject to expiration and obsolescence. Accordingly, quantities purchased and sell through rates are periodically monitored for potential overstocking or pending expiration as a basis for establishing the appropriate reserve for any estimated expiration or obsolescence.

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Revenue Recognition 

The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met:

persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, 

shipping terms are FOB shipping point 

delivery has occurred, 

the sales price is fixed or determinable and 

collectability is probable. 

Shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenues when billed to customers or included in the sales price.  Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.

Research and Development 

The Company currently maintains a functional laboratory employing a new product development director, Dr. Patel, and a chemist and a lab technician that identify new technology, test product alternatives and improve existing formulations and technologies. In addition, our founder and Chief Executive Officer devotes a substantial portion of his time in identifying new technologies and formulations to develop new products and improve existing products with the newest technology available. Such activities are expensed in the year incurred. Such costs include laboratory supplies, salaries, materials and consultant fees. These costs are classified as product development, salaries, selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and amounted to $34,736 and $47,326 for 2016-QTR and 2015-QTR, respectively.

Earnings Per Share 

Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for all of the periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations because the reported net loss in each of these periods results in their inclusion being antidilutive. Antidilutive securities, which consist of stock options and warrants that are not included in the diluted net loss per share calculation, consisted of an aggregate of 444,213 and 316,526 shares as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTE 3.   LIQUIDITY and GOING CONCERN

We have sustained operational losses since our inception. At March 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $20,492 million. The Company cannot predict how long it will continue to incur further losses or whether it will ever become profitable as this is dependent upon the reduction of certain operating expenses, success of new and existing products and increase in overall revenue among other things. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.

As of March 31, 2016, we had $2,632,761 in cash. While we have historically financed our operations and growth primarily through the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, a line of credit and the issuance of promissory notes, the Company has started several new revenue initiatives creating additional revenue streams.  Some of these initiatives include: establishing an online store  (   Shop.DSLaboratories.com   ) which became operational in the third quarter of 2014, generating $85,636 2015-YTD and $125,041 2016-QTR in net revenue, respectively. In the second quarter 2015, we began selling through      http://www.costco.com   , which generated net revenue of $315,404 2016-YTD. 

Although we cannot predict our success with these products or projects, all are currently under development and production and in various stages of completion. We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition, including but not limited to  continuing to seek debt and new equity financing. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all.

Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and carrying amount or classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition.

NOTE 4.   RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 30, 2016, during the preparation of the Company s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company identified certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the period ending September 30, 2015, and determined these transactions did not reflect the proper matching of revenues and costs. The impact of these transactions on the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, have been considered and have been disclosed and reported in the notes to the Company s financial statements as reported in the annual 10-K report for the year ending December 31, 2014.

The results of each quarterly 10-Q filings during the nine months ending September 30, 2015, as previously filed, also did not reflect the proper matching of revenues and costs. The impact of this restatement on the Company s financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015, are reflected in the tables below:

NOTE 5.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ), which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial statements. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

10 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement   Period Adjustments. This ASU simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination; the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. This ASU will require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. It also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This ASU is effective for the annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU simplifies the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory within the scope of this update to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than the lower of cost or market. This ASU is effective for the annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

The FASB has issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to continue as a Going Concern . This ASU requires management to assess every reporting period whether there is  substantial doubt  about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.  The amendments define that  substantial doubt  exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued.  When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, management should disclose: (1) principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt; and (2) management s evaluation of the significance of those events.  Further, management should also consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If so, management should disclose information that enables users to understand those plans that alleviated the substantial doubt.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

The FASB has issued ASU No. 2014-12,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period . This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

11 

The FASB has issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective on January 1, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. For all other entities (nonpublic entities), the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. A nonpublic entity may elect to apply this guidance earlier, however, only as prescribed in this ASU.  The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard and its impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.

NOTE 6.   INVENTORIES

Significant components of inventory at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist primarily of:

In March 2016, the Company, under former management, entered in a barter credit agreement with a third party to sell slow moving, finished goods inventory  in exchange for trade credits the company may use to purchase goods and/or services in the future.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016 the trade credits acquired under the agreement totaled $ 2,228,617,  have no expiration and can be used at any time.  The cost of slow moving inventory under the arrangement totaled $249,319.  See  Footnote 10.   Barter Credits  for additional information regarding the revenue recognition of the barter credits.  

NOTE 7.   INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Significant components of intangible assets at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of:

The following table represents the amortized cost of the various assets over the remaining years; the weighted average remaining period is 5.83 years.

NOTE 8.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Pending and threatened litigation

From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising from the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations.

On March 29, 2016, DS Healthcare, Mr. Khesin, and certain former members of the Board of Directors   were sued in a class action styled,  Prasant Shah v. DS Healthcare Group, Inc. , et. al., Case No. 16-60661, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  A later-filed class action has been consolidated.  The class action arises from the Company s March 23, 2016 and March 28, 2016 8-K filings, which stated, in pertinent part, that the audit committee had concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the two fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 (the  June and September 2015 Quarters ), should no longer be relied upon because of certain errors in such financial statements, and that Daniel Khesin had been terminated for cause and removed a Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors.  Plaintiffs have until November 2, 2016 to file an Amended Complaint, which DS Healthcare must respond to no later than December 19, 2016.   The Company also received the first of three related shareholder derivative demands on March 29, 2016.  A mediation concerning the class action and the derivative demands is scheduled for October 17, 2016, in Miami, Florida.

On May 27, 2016, PhotoMedex, Inc., Radiancy, Inc., and PhotoMedex Technology, Inc. (collectively,  PhotoMedex )  filed a civil action for damages and declaratory relief against DS Healthcare in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The lawsuit is styled PhotoMedex, Inc. v. DS Healthcare Group, Inc., Case No. 1:16-cv-03981.  The lawsuit arises from two merger agreements: (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization among DS Healthcare Group, Inc., PHMD P Acquisition Corp., PhotoMedex, Inc. and Radiancy, Inc. dated February 19, 2016; and (ii) an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization by and among DS Healthcare Group, Inc., PHMD Professional Acquisition Corp., PhotoMedex Technology, Inc. and PhotoMedex, Inc. dated February 19, 2016.  PhotoMedex alleges that DS Healthcare breached both agreements by failing to meet its pre-closing obligations and not completing the transactions contemplated by the agreements.  PhotoMedex seeks a declaratory judgment that their terminations of the two agreements were proper, and requests an award of damages specified by the agreements, including a  break-up fee  of USD $3 million.   DS Healthcare disputes the claims asserted by PhotoMedex, including that PhotoMedex is entitled to the  break-up fee  under the agreements.  DS Healthcare has also asserted a counterclaims for damages against PhotoMedex for their breaches of the two agreements.  An initial case management conference is scheduled for October 13, 2016.

On December 28, 2015, the Company, our chief executive officer, Daniel Khesin individually, and Abner Silva, a former consultant and employee was named in a lawsuit brought in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida by a former investor relations contractor claiming monetary damages and allegations of using material or false misrepresentations.  The Plaintiff s complaint alleges owed compensation in stock and cash. Management intends to vigorously defend the action and contends the suit is primarily without merit as the contractor was dismissed in writing. Accordingly, management has provided a contingency reserve this matter.

The Company accounts for its facility leases using the straight-line method and incurred $535,012 and $489,643 in total rent expense for 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2015, the Company was served a suit in connection to its Asheville, NC ( Asheville ) abandoned office lease. The suit calls for payments of $73,000. On September 21, 2016, the Company was notified it has received default judgement in the amount of $73,000. The Company plans of appealing the default judgment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had sufficiently accrued for the Asheville suit.

The Company has received several pre-litigation demand letters from various former employees, including but not limited to a demand for alleged past wages, shares and commissions on various sales which do not qualify as revenue under GAAP guidance from former Chief Executive Officer, Renee Barch- Niles. While we cannot determine the outcome of these disputes, the Company intends to vehemently defend its position to the fullest extent possible. Accordingly, the Company has not reserved for these disputes.

At this time, the amount of any loss, or range of loss, cannot be reasonably estimated as the case has only been initiated and no discovery has been conducted to determine the validity of any claim or claims made by plaintiffs. Therefore, the Company has recorded any reserve or contingent liability related to these particular legal matters. However, in the future, as the cases progress, the Company may be required to increase its contingent liability or reserve for these matters.  For additional information regarding these matters, see the Pending Transactions disclosures in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015 filed on October 7, 2016.

NOTE 9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company was a party to the following related party transactions not disclosed elsewhere in these financial statements:

NOTE 10.      BARTER CREDITS 

In December 2015, the Company, under former management entered into an agreement with a barter trading company to sell slow moving, finished goods in exchange for prepaid credits. During the three months ended March 31,2016, the Company sold merchandise worth $2,228,617 to this barter trading company. However, these credits proved to have no economic value and accordingly revenue did not meet the criteria as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 605 ( ASC ). The Company has reversed the sales to this barter trading company since it failed to meet the revenue standards and has expensed the barter credits, the results of which are reflected in net revenue of the company s consolidated condensed statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ending March 31, 2016.

NOTE 11.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated subsequent events or transactions occurring through the date the financial statements were issued. The following items are a summary of events or transactions occurring subsequent to the balance-sheet date, but prior to the issuance of these financial statements, that have a material effect on the financial statements and therefore require adjustment or disclosure in these statements.

On October 7 th , the company issued an 8-K to inform the investors that previously submitted filings should not be relied upon for investing decisions. The company will be filing amended 10-Q s for the periods ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. These amended financial statements will include adjustments to the comparable financial statements for 2014. The company became aware of the need to issue amended financial reports on or about September 25 th  as part of the audit of its financials by its independent auditor, BF Borges CPA PC. The total impact of the adjustments for the nine months ending September 30, 2015 amount to an increased net loss of $1,125,792. The primary adjustments are between periods within 2015 and the company deemed that the adjustments required the filing of adjusted quarterly financial reports.

Throughout the year ended 2014 and 2015, Daniel Khesin, the Company's former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, received in addition to base compensation, reimbursement and payroll advances of expenses of approximately $76,000 and $40,000 respectively, which were for non-business related goods and services. Pursuant to his executive employment agreement $50,000 in shares were to be payable in shares of the Company's common stock at fiscal year-end. While Mr. Khesin believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain bonus or other perquisites earned by him on a monthly basis under his employment agreement, such payments, if any, required approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received until subsequent to 2014 and 2015. Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits advances or loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. While our audit committee has concluded that the payments made to Mr. Khesin prior to board approval may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, in the event it is determined any such payments were a violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. The Company s Audit Committee has agreed with the findings. On September 29 th , 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29 th , 2016. See "Controls and Procedures" and "Executive Compensation" below.

During 2013, in addition to base compensation paid to Abner Silva, a consultant deemed to be an officer by our independent auditor for accounting purposes, our company advanced approximately $11,500, to Mr. Silva. While Mr. Silva, believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain moneys owed to him or his affiliate companies, such payments, if any, required prior approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the company on September 29 th , 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29 th , 2016.

In December 2015, the Company, under former management entered into an agreement with a barter trading company to sell slow moving, finished goods in exchange for prepaid credits. During 2015 and through April 2016, the Company sold merchandise worth $956,176 and $4,566,717 to this barter trading company. However, these credits proved to have no economic value and accordingly revenue did not meet the criteria as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 605 ( ASC ). The Company has reversed the sales to this barter trading company that did not meet the revenue standards.

15 

In January 2016, the company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a private party in the amount of $1,996,500 for 605,000 shares of the company s stock. To date, the purchase agreement has only partially settled. The Company s has offset subscription receivable against the additional paid in capital of $1,196,500. The Board of Directors has decided to negotiate a revision to the original Stock Purchase Agreement to reach an appropriate resolution to the matter. The company has no way of knowing what the financial impact will be.

On May 2 nd , 2016, the company received a letter from an attorney representing its former CEO, Renee Barch-Niles requesting certain payments she believes are due arising from her employment contract. This includes salary demands, equity demands and commission demands on the above barter transaction. The total claims made by Ms. Barch-Niles are $2,500,000 worth of shares of the company s stock, $123,000 in commissions from the barter trading arrangement, and $300,000 in severance payments. The company maintains that Ms. Barch-Niles is not due any payments subsequent to her separation from the company and will take all appropriate action to defend against the claims.

On September 27, 2016, pursuant to the Company s By-Laws, the current Board of Directors approved and ratified all shares to the former management through date of termination.

On September 26 th , 2016, the company received Nasdaq s staff determination letter, informing the company of Nasdaq s intention to deny the company s request for continued listing due to the delinquent reports. Separately, Nasdaq informed the company of its determination of additional basis for delisting due to public interest concerns under listing Rule 5101 raised by 1. The company s failure to promptly initiate and conduct an independent investigation, recommended by its previous independent auditors, into concerns identified by its former board of directors, including concerns regarding revenue recognition and stock issuances, among other matters; and 2. The Company s inability to produce minutes evidencing meetings of the Company s board of directors for calendar year 2015 and for the first four months of calendar year 2016. Further, and also as a separate basis for delisting, Nasdaq informed the company of its belief the Company had made misleading statements and/or omitted material facts in its communications with Staff, in violation of Listing Rule 5250(a)(1). Pursuant to Nasdaq listing Rule 5800 series the Company appealed the staff s determination to a Hearings Panel and requested an oral hearing to appeal the staff determination. In addition, the Company requested a stay of the suspension and delisting action pending the issuance of a written decision by the Hearings Panel. In the request, the company stated that the delinquent reports would be filed prior to the October 11 th  due date, informed Nasdaq that an independent investigation had been initiated by the company with an expected completion date of approximately October 11 th , 2016, informed Nasdaq of its efforts to retrieve the missing minutes via a diligent search of its email archives and attempts to contact prior board members for their records, and its disagreement with the staff s belief that any misleading statement had been made. The company received from Nasdaq, on September 26 th , 2016, a letter informing them that the requested hearing will take place on November 10 th .

The class action arises from the Company s March 23, 2016 and March 28, 2016 8-K filings, which stated, in pertinent part, that the audit committee had concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the two fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 (the  June and September 2015 Quarters ), should no longer be relied upon because of certain errors in such financial statements, and that Daniel Khesin had been terminated for cause and removed a Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors.

(collectively,  PhotoMedex )  filed a civil action for damages and declaratory relief against DS Healthcare in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The lawsuit is styled PhotoMedex, Inc. v. DS Healthcare Group, Inc., Case No. 1:16-cv-03981.

PhotoMedex seeks a declaratory judgment that their terminations of the two agreements were proper, and requests an award of damages specified by the agreements, including a  break-up fee  of USD $3 million.  DS Healthcare disputes the claims asserted by PhotoMedex, including that PhotoMedex is entitled to the  break-up fee  under the agreements.

ITEM 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. 

This filing contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our projected sales and profitability, our Company s growth strategies, our Company s future financing plans and our Company s anticipated needs for working capital. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the matters described in this filing generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words  may,   will,   should,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   intend  or  project  or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology.

This discussion is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report.

Significant Accounting Policies

Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 2 to condensed consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: 1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and 2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our condensed consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements:

Risks and Uncertainties    The Company s business could be impacted by price pressure on its product manufacturing, acceptance of its products in the market place, new competitors, changes in federal and/or state legislation and other factors. The Company also has been experiencing significant growth which puts serious strains on its cash availability requirements. If the Company is unsuccessful in securing adequate liquidity, its plans may be curtailed. Adverse changes in these areas could negatively impact the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Accounts Receivable    Accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible.

Inventory    Inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Our inventory is subject to expiration and obsolescence. Accordingly, quantities purchased and sell through rates are periodically monitored for potential overstocking or pending expiration as a basis for establishing the appropriate reserve for any estimated expiration or obsolescence.

Revenue Recognition    The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met:

persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists,

delivery has occurred,

the sales price is fixed or determinable and

collectability is probable.

20 

Shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenues when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.

Research and Development    The Company incurs formulation costs that include salaries, materials and consultant fees. These costs are classified as product development, selling and general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015

Revenues, net    Total net revenues decreased $372,975 from $2,698,010 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $2,325,034 for the three months ended March 31, 2016

Net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary were $687,978  in 2016-QTR compared to $664,183 in 2015-QTR . Sales generated from US operations decreased $396,770 from $2,033,827  in 2015-QTR to $1,637,057 in 2015-QTR . The reduction in net revenue is a result of an increase in backorder.

Cost of Goods Sold    Total cost of goods sold increased $219,850 or18.1% from $1,214,215 in 2015-QTR to $1,434,066 in 2016-QTR. The increase in cost of goods sold is primarily a result of the sale of product inventory to a third party in exchange for vendor credits to be used towards the Company s marketing efforts.

Consequently, the gross margin decreased from 55.0% in 2016-QTR to 38.3% 2015-QTR, with US operations accounting for $1,099,581 or 74% in 2015-QTR and $502,168 or 56% in 2016-QTR of the gross margin dollars and with DS Mexico accounting for $384,214 or 26% in 2015QTR and $388,800 or 44% in 2016-QTR of gross margin dollars.

Selling and Marketing Costs    Selling and marketing costs increased $367,781 or 46.5% from $790,278 in 2015-QTR to $1,158,059 in 2016-QTR. The increase was due to the following:

Increases of: 

$238,455 for marketing and promotional expenses, as a result of the Company increasing on-line advertising and brand awareness, and 

Partially offset by decreases of: 

$15,231 for Internet and Web Hosting costs, as a result of increased activity through the online store and technical support needed. 

General and Administrative Costs    General and administrative costs increased $774,559 or 58.2% from $1,330,183 in 2015-QTR to $2,104,741 (2016-QTR). The increase is due to the following:

Increases of: 

$129,383 for personnel costs, as a result of the senior management and several other staff hired  during the third quarter of 2015, and 

$46,635 for other general and administrative costs, as a result of improved overall efficiencies. 

21 

Partially offset by decreases of: 

$321,811 in bad debt attributable to improved collection efforts with international customers. 

$ 103,237  in depreciation and amortization due to the write-off of a distribution agreement for the country of Brazil in 2015.  The reduction was a result of an impaired intangible brand rights agreement expensed in 2015. 

Other Income and Expenses    Other income and expense increased $91,149 from to $232,879 in expenses in 2015-QTR.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We had cash of $2,632,760 and working capital of $4,622,008 at March 31, 2016. Our operating and capital requirements in connection with supporting our expanding operations and introducing new products have been and will continue to be significant to us. Since inception, our losses from operations and working capital required to grow our business were satisfied primarily through the private sales of our common stock and by credit financing.

Despite our losses since inception, we believe that by increasing our sales and gross profit margins while maintaining and better optimizing our current operational structure and administrative expenses, we can minimize the cash needed to support our operations. Our largest consumption of cash is the working capital necessary to support expanding sales. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and may also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition, including methods to increase gross profit margins and reducing and streamlining our operational costs and overhead. We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of common stock, advances from related parties and third parties and through our credit facility. We are continuing to seek debt and equity financing; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all.

Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Operating activities used net cash for the three months ended March 31, 2016 of $2,121,911. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $336,849 as follows:

$464,580 provided by a decrease in gross accounts receivable not including the non-cash effect of changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts,

$270,748 provided by a decrease in inventory component levels resulting from implementing a purchasing strategy to continue eliminating backorders and improve customer satisfaction,

$184,863 provided by an increase in accounts payable resulting from raw material purchases from vendors, and

$427,418 used by a decrease in accrued expenses as a result of payments of certain accrued expenses such as commissions due.

Cash Flows used in Investing Activities

Our investing activities provided $467 in net cash during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our financing activities used $2,753 in net cash during the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of payments, net of proceeds, from loans payable.

22 

Financial Position

Total Assets    Our total assets decreased $2,635,009 from $10,715,426 as of December 31, 2015 to $8,080,416 as of March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the cash used to repay creditors and increase inventory components. There was a net decrease in current assets of $2,608,202 the components of which are discussed further below. The decrease in total assets was also the result of a decrease of $23,382 in Intangible assets, due to amortization, as well as a decrease in Equipment, net of depreciation, of $2,958.

Current Assets    The net decrease in current assets of $2,608,202 was primarily associated with a decrease in cash of $1,884,844 primarily to support operations, a $270,748 decrease in inventory levels, and a $399,339 decrease in accounts receivable. These net changes are primarily driven by changes in sales and other factors more specifically discussed below:

Inventory    Inventory levels decreased 7.3% from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016, primarily as a result of product sold to a third party in exchange for vendor credits to be used in the future to help offset the cost of future market and advertising campaigns.

Accounts Receivable, net    Accounts receivable decreased $399,339, primarily as a result of decreased sales and increased collection efforts with our international customers.

Prepaid Expenses and other current assets    Prepaid expenses decreased $53,272 primarily as a result of the amortization of certain prepaid expense being amortized to general and administrative expenses within one year.

Material Commitments

None.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

None.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements.

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the forms and rules of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

In connection with the preparation of this Form 10 Q, our management, including the CEO and CFO, updated its December 31, 2015 evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 2016. As described below, management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which is an integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures. As a result of those material weaknesses, our management has concluded that, as of March 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as a result of certain material weaknesses.

The specific material weaknesses that management identified in our internal controls as of March 31, 2016 that persist are as follows:

23 

We did not have adequate staffing resources to 1) prepare account reconciliations, financial statements; fluctuation analysis and relevant analytics on a timely basis, and 2) provide appropriate review and supervision for all necessary areas.  Additionally, our general staff do not have the necessary training to perform appropriate analytical and/or review procedures. 

We did not have a sufficient number of 1) adequately trained technical accounting and external reporting personnel to support standalone external financial reporting under SEC requirements, and 2) personnel with necessary experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address and report fluctuation analysis and relevant analytics to senior management. 

We did not have appropriate written internal control documentation of our process and procedures for all necessary areas, including documentation and testing of key internal controls. 

We did not obtain adequate documentation to support all credit card transactions. 

We did not obtain adequate documentation to support revenue recognition, resulting in recognition of revenue for products not shipped and appropriateness of amount being billed. 

We did not have effective controls over stock based payments made to employees and non-employees, including proper accounting of awards as either equity or liability awards and timely processing and recording of stock based payment arrangements. 

We did not have effective controls over our executive management s decisions to book certain barter credits as revenue as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 605 ( ASC ). As result the Company has reversed certain of its sales to customers that did not meet the standards. 

We did not have effective controls over issuing customer credit approvals and product credit memorandums. As a result, credits were issued by multiple individuals and without the finance department s approval and in some cases overwritten certain credit policies and procedures. 

We did not have effective controls over our revenue recognition and policies which caused certain products to be shipped to customers without prior credit checks and approvals from the finance department. 

We did not have effective controls over customer pricing and as a result pricing discrepancies between wholesale and retail were established by multiple individuals without the correct policies and procedures. 

We did not have effective controls over our executive management s overrides of certain policies and procedures, as a result certain advances, expenses and other possible illegal activities may have occurred. 

We did not have effective controls over stock issuances and as result shares may have been issued without the correct approval and documentation. 

We did not have effective controls over incentives to the sales force and as a result customers received incentives that were not properly designed, approved or lacked proper structure. 

We did not have effective controls over the advance of $11,500 to Abner Silva in 2013, which we have deemed an officer. As a result,  these payments were received as satisfaction of certain moneys owed to him or his affiliate companies, such payments, if any, required prior approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received. This loan may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation.  

We also did not effectively implement comprehensive entity level internal controls and were unable to adequately segregate duties within the accounting department due to an insufficient number of staff, and implement appropriate information technology controls.

24 

Throughout the year ended 2014 and 2015, Daniel Khesin, the Company's former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, received in addition to base compensation, reimbursement and payroll advances of expenses of approximately $76,000 and $40,000 respectively, which were for non-business related goods and services. Pursuant to his executive employment agreement $50,000 in shares were to be payable in shares of the Company's common stock at fiscal year-end. While Mr. Khesin believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain bonus or other perquisites earned by him on a monthly basis under his employment agreement, such payments, if any, required approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received until subsequent to 2014 and 2015. Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits advances or loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. While our audit committee has concluded that the payments made to Mr. Khesin prior to board approval may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, in the event it is determined any such payments were a violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. The Company s Audit Committee has agreed with the findings. On September 29 th , 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29 th , 2016. See "Controls and Procedures" and "Executive Compensation" below.

We consider the payment of the personal benefits prior to receiving board approval, as a failure of our internal control system. See  Risk Factors  above. To remediate this failure, we have implemented enhanced controls over credit card and cash disbursements and documentation under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, John Power. We have also enhanced controls over expense reporting and established stricter guidelines for transaction receipts. These enhanced controls include, but are not limited to establishing a preparation and review functions for expense reports, mandatory receipt requirement, limited access to the physical credit card and weekly reporting. We feel that these enhancements will be adequate to prevent this event from recurring in the future.

Since our inception we have relied on an outside accounting consultants to ensure that our financial statements contain all necessary adjustments to conform to U.S. GAAP. The consultants are U.S. certified public accountants. We expect to be materially dependent upon consultants or another third parties which can provide us with the same level of accounting consulting services, for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Furthermore, in an effort to remediate certain of the weaknesses above we have also added three independent directors to our board of directors who have formed an audit committee including the appointment of a financial expert. The committee is charged with, and has been, developing financial policies and controls, reviewing and providing oversight to our financial reporting processes, financial statements and public filings. Our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will be dependent upon the development and implementation of these changes, which will require both the hiring of additional accounting personnel and the investment in enhanced systems, policies and procedures. While we expect to continue to rely upon our outside accounting consultants until such time as we are able to hire a properly qualified chief financial officer, if we are able to successfully implement these changes to our internal control over financial reporting we believe we will be able to remediate substantially all of the material weaknesses described earlier in this section. However, there are no assurances we will be able to devote the necessary capital to hire the additional personnel and institute the additional systems, policies and procedures to the level necessary. In that event, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses described earlier in this section will not result in errors in our financial statements in future periods.

Our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

The Company is a non-accelerated filer and is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Accordingly, this Annual Report does not contain an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting, since the rules for smaller reporting companies provide for this exemption.

25 

Plans for Remediation of Material Weaknesses

We intend to implement changes to strengthen our internal controls. We are in the process of developing and/or implementing remediation plans for the identified material weaknesses and we expect that work on the plans will continue throughout 2016 and possibly into 2017, as financial resources permit.    The Company is currently working on formalizing its policies and procedures in writing and to improve the integration of its financial consolidation and reporting system into non accounting departments. Where appropriate, the Company is receiving advice and assistance from third-party experts as it implements and refines its remediation plan.

We will begin to implement remediation procedures in two areas of our operations.  First we will restructure the financial reporting process to provide an improved review function by restructuring the responsibilities of both the accounting staff and the participation of the company s non-accounting personnel. The addition of the financial review process should reduce the risk of reporting errors in the preparation and delivery of financial results.

As part of the restructuring of responsibilities, we will also have increased the scope and involvement of non-accounting personnel to provide more direct operational insight into reported financial information in an effort to improve both its relevance and its accuracy.  In connection with that restructuring of responsibilities, we are providing additional training in best practices accounting procedures and GAAP to non-accounting personnel to improve the accuracy of reported financial information.

To assist both accounting and non-accounting personnel in their efforts to improve efficiency and accuracy, we will begin to restructure the chart of accounts to improve clarity and reduce the risk of inaccurate or misposting errors.  The new chart of accounts will provide clearer, more informative titles and reduces redundancy.

Additional measures may be necessary, and the measures we expect to take to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that such material weakness or other material weaknesses would not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except as otherwise stated above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On May 27, 2016, PhotoMedex, Inc., Radiancy, Inc., and PhotoMedex Technology, Inc. (collectively,  PhotoMedex )  filed a civil action for damages and declaratory relief against DS Healthcare in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The lawsuit is styled PhotoMedex, Inc. v. DS Healthcare Group, Inc., Case No. 1:16-cv-03981.  The lawsuit arises from two merger agreements: (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization among DS Healthcare Group, Inc., PHMD P Acquisition Corp., PhotoMedex, Inc. and Radiancy, Inc. dated February 19, 2016; and (ii) an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization by and among DS Healthcare Group, Inc., PHMD Professional Acquisition Corp., PhotoMedex Technology, Inc. and PhotoMedex, Inc. dated February 19, 2016.  PhotoMedex alleges that DS Healthcare breached both agreements by failing to meet its pre-closing obligations and not completing the transactions contemplated by the agreements.  PhotoMedex seeks a declaratory judgment that their terminations of the two agreements were proper, and requests an award of damages specified by the agreements, including a  break-up fee  of USD $3 million.   DS Healthcare disputes the claims asserted by PhotoMedex, including that PhotoMedex is entitled to the  break-up fee  under the agreements.  DS Healthcare has also asserted a counterclaims for damages against PhotoMedex for their breaches of the two agreements.  An initial case management conference is scheduled for October 13, 2016.

The lawsuit is styled Microcap Headlines Inc. v. DS Healthcare Group, Inc. et al., Case No. 2015-030046-CA-01.  Plaintiff Microcap asserts claims for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, fraud (solely against defendant Silva), violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act, and quantum meruit, all of which arise from an October 15, 2014 contract between Microcap and DS Healthcare pursuant to which Microcap promised to provide certain investor awareness services in exchange for compensation in the form of cash and warrants to purchase DS Healthcare stock.  Microcap seeks damages in an unspecified amount.  DS Healthcare disputes the claims asserted by Microcap in the lawsuit.  Court-ordered mediation is scheduled for November 22, 2016, and the case is scheduled for trial to commence sometime during the three-week trial period beginning on January 17, 2017.
