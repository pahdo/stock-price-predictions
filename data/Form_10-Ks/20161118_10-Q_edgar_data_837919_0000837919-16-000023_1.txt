(1) GENERAL INFORMATION AND
SUMMARY  

  The Everest
Fund, L.P., formerly Everest Futures Fund, L.P. (an Iowa Limited Partnership), (the  Partnership ) is a limited partnership
organized in June 1988, under the Iowa Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the  Act ) for the purpose of engaging in
the speculative trading of commodity futures and options thereon and forward contracts (collectively referred to as  Commodity
Interests ). The sole General Partner of the Partnership is Everest Asset Management, Inc. (the  General Partner ).  

  On July
1, 1995, the Partnership recommenced its offering under a Regulation D, Rule 506 private placement. The private placement offering
is continuing at a gross subscription price per unit equal to net asset value (NAV) per unit, plus an organization and offering
cost reimbursement fee payable to the General Partner, and an ongoing compensation fee equal to 3% of the net asset value of Class
A Units sold. The Class A Units (retail shares) continue to be charged an initial 1% Offering and Organization fee as a reduction
to capital.  

  Currently,
R.J. O Brien and Associates, LLC ( RJO ), 222 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, serves
as the Fund s clearing broker to execute and clear Fund s futures and equities transactions and provide other brokerage-related
services. RJO Professional FX is a division of RJO. RJO Professional FX may execute foreign exchange or other over the counter
transaction with the Fund as principal. RJO is a subsidiary of R.J. O Brien Holdings Corporation. RJO is registered with
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) as a Futures Commission Merchant ( FCM ) and is
a member of the National Futures Association ( NFA ) in several capacities, including as a Forex Dealer Member ( FDM )
and is a member of certain principal U.S. contracts markets. RJO is a full clearing member of the CME Group, the Intercontinental
Exchange, NYSE Liffe U.C., and the CBOE Futures Exchange ( CFE ).  

  (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

  Revenue Recognition  

  Commodity
futures contracts, forward contracts, physical commodities, and related options are recorded on the trade-date basis and realized
gains or losses are recognized when contracts are liquidated. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis
and marked to market daily. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market
price) are reported in the statement of financial condition as a net unrealized gain or loss, as there exists a right of offset
of unrealized gains or losses in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39 -  Offsetting
of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.  Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported
in the statement of operations. Fair value of exchange-traded contracts is based upon exchange settlement prices.  

Fair
value of non-exchange-traded contracts is based on third party quoted dealer values on the Interbank market.  

  Use of
Estimates  

  The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents represent short-term highly liquid investments with
maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition. The Partnership maintains deposits with high quality financial institutions
in amounts that are in excess of federally insured limits; however, the Partnership does not believe it is exposed to any significant
credit risk.  

  Redemptions
Payable  

  Pursuant
to the provisions of FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, redemptions approved by the General Partner prior to
month end with a fixed effective date and fixed amount are recorded as redemptions payable as of month end.  

  Fair
Value of Financial Instruments  

  The financial
instruments held by the Company are reported in the statements of financial condition at fair value, or at carrying amounts that
approximate fair value, due to their highly liquid nature and short-term maturity.  

  Foreign
Currency Translation The Partnership s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, however, it transacts business in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange
rates as of the date of the statement of financial conditions. Gains and losses on investment activity are translated at the prevailing
exchange rate on the date of each respective transaction while period end balances are translated at the period end currency rates.
Realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses are included in trading income or loss in the statements of operations.  

  Income
Taxes  

  No provision
for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as each partner is responsible for reporting income (loss)
based upon the pro rata share of the profits or losses of the Partnership.  

  The Partnership
files U.S. federal and state tax returns.   

  (3) FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

  Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has defined a hierarchy for fair
value measurements. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
are described below:  

  Level
1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to
access at the measurement date.  

Level
2. Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;
and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. A significant adjustment to a Level 2
input could result in the Level 2 measurement becoming a Level 3 measurement.  

  Level
3. Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for
the asset or liability. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances
and may require significant management judgment or estimation.  

  The table
below demonstrates the Partnership s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015:  

(4) LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT  

  The Limited
Partners and General Partner share in the profits and losses of the Partnership in proportion to the number of units or unit equivalents
held by each. However, no Limited Partner is liable for obligations of the Partnership in excess of their capital contribution
and profits, if any, and such other amounts as they may be liable for pursuant to the Act. Distributions of profits are made solely
at the discretion of the General Partner.  

  Responsibility
for managing the Partnership is vested solely in the General Partner. The General Partner has delegated complete trading authority
to an unrelated party (see  Note 5 ).  

  Although
the Agreement does not permit redemptions for the first six months following a Limited Partner s admission to the Partnership,
the Agreement does permit the Partnership to declare additional regular redemption dates.  

  The Partnership
will be dissolved on December 31, 2020, or upon the occurrence of certain events, as specified in the Limited Partnership agreement.  

    (5) AGREEMENTS AND RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

  EMC Capital
Management, Inc. (EMC), 2201 Waukegan Road, Suite West 240, Bannockburn, IL 60015; telephone: 847-267-8700, serves as the Partnership s
Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA).  

  EMC receives
a monthly management fee equal to 0.167% (2% annually) of the Partnership s month-end net asset value, (as defined),and
a quarterly incentive fee of 20% of the Partnership s new net trading profits. The incentive fee is retained by EMC even
though trading losses may occur in subsequent quarters; however, no further incentive fees are payable until any such trading
losses (other than losses attributable to redeemed units and losses attributable to assets reallocated to another advisor) are
recouped by the Partnership.  

  Effective
November 2003, the General Partner charges the Partnership a monthly management fee equal to 0.50% of the Partnership s
Class A beginning-of-month net asset value.  

  From the
monthly management fee the General Partner deducts the round turn trading costs and related exchange fees (between $5.80 to $10.70
per round turn trade on domestic exchanges, and higher for foreign exchanges) and pays the selling agents and certain other parties,
if any, up to 50% of the fee retained by the General Partner. The General Partner may replace or add trading advisors at any time.  

The clearing
agreements with the clearing brokers provide that the clearing brokers charge the Partnership brokerage commissions at the rate
of between $5.80 to $10.70 per round-turn trade, plus applicable exchange, give up fees and National Futures Association fees
for futures contracts and options on futures contracts executed on domestic exchanges and over the counter markets. For trades
on certain foreign exchanges, the rates may be higher.   

  The Partnership
also reimburses the clearing brokers for all delivery, insurance, storage or other charges incidental to trading and paid to third
parties.  

  The Partnership
earns interest on 78% of the Partnership s average monthly cash balance on deposit with its clearing brokers at a rate equal
to the average 91-day Treasury Bill rate during that month.  

  A substantial
portion of the Partnership s assets are held in a cash account a Everest s futures broker R.J. O Brien, the
FCM. As is standard in the industry Everest receives 90% of the 3 month T-bill rate on its cash that is unused for trading. The
Partnership s assets at RJO cash account are subject to potential loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations and default.  

(6) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  

  In the
normal course of business, the Partnership engages in trading derivatives by purchasing and selling futures contracts and options
on future contracts for its own account. All such trading is effectuated as speculative as opposed to hedging. Effective January
1, 2009, the Partnership adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives   Hedging, which requires
enhanced disclosures about the objectives and strategies for using derivatives and quantitative disclosures about the fair value
amounts, and gains and losses on derivatives.  

  See below for such disclosures.   

  Fair Value of Derivative Instruments  

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the monthly average of futures contracts bought and sold was approximately $-13,740.  

(7)
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES  

  The
Partnership engages in the speculative trading of U.S. and foreign futures contracts, options on U.S. and foreign futures contracts,
and forward contracts ( collectively derivatives ). These derivatives include both financial and non-financial contracts
held as part of a diversified trading strategy. The Partnership is exposed to both market risk, the risk arising from changes
in the market value of the contracts; and credit risk, the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms
of a contract.  

  The
purchase and sale of futures and options on futures contracts requires margin deposits with a Futures Commission Merchant ( FCM ).
Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all
customer transactions and assets from the FCM s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property such
as U.S. Treasury Bills, deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the FCM s
segregation requirements. In the event of an FCM s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated
funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than the total of cash and other property deposited.  

For
derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Partnership is exposed to a market
risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. As both
a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable
changes in the price of the contract underlying the option.  

  In
the case of forward contracts, over-the-counter options contracts or swap contracts, which are traded on the interbank or other
institutional market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather
than a clearinghouse backed by a group of financial institutions; thus, there likely will be greater counterparty credit risk.
The Partnership trades only with those counterparties that it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Partnership are
valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty
will be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS   

  The
following financial highlights show the Partnership s financial performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and September 30, 2015.  

Interim
Financial Statements  

  The
statements of financial condition, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2016, the statements
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the statements of cash flows and changes in partners 
capital (net asset value) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the accompanying notes to the financial statements
are unaudited.  

  Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles may be omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, such financial statements
and accompanying disclosures reflect all adjustments, which were of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation
of financial position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash
flows and changes in partners  capital (net asset value) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results
of operations for the full nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year or any other period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and the notes thereto included in our form 10-k as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Item
                                         2.       Management s
                                         Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   

Each
month ended September 30, 2016 compared to each month ended September 30, 2015.  

  Class
A Units were positive 8.23% in January 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,445.12 as of January 31, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were positive 3.44% in January 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,517.72 as of January 31, 2015.  

  Large
gains came from trends in interest rates (both directions, at different times of the month), energies and stock indices. Much
smaller losses came from grains and softs.  

The
great start for the New Year for the Fund more than erased the loss from last year s trading. It also came during a month
of considerable stress on the equity markets, with the S P 500 losing 3.24% despite the stock market recovery at the end of
the month.  

Class
A Units were positive 4.89% in February 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,564.60 as of February 29, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were negative 2.33% in February 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,459.13 as of February 28, 2015.  

  The
gains came mostly from interest rate positions, with smaller gains in softs, grains and global stock indices. Losses were posted
in currencies.  

After
fluctuating up and down for most of the month, our energy and metals positions were essentially flat for the month for the month
of February.  

  Class
A Units were negative 7.98% in March 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,359.86 as of March 31, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were negative 0.11% in March 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,456.35 as of March 31, 2015.  

  The
Fund was negatively correlated with the S P 500 which was +6.6% in March. The Fund was +4.46% YTD through the end of March
with the S P 500 +0.77% for the same period.  

The
losses came across the board from interest rates, currencies, softs, global stock indices, energies, grains, metals and meats.
Trends that were established and very profitable for the Fund in January and February abruptly reversed in March for the largest
one month decline since EMC took over the trading for the Fund in December of 2012.  

Class
A Units were negative 7.81% in April 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,175.61 as of April 30, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were negative 0.68% in April 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,439.66 as of April 30, 2015.  

  The
Everest Fund had a loss of -7.81% in April. Gains in currencies, meats and grains were not enough to offset losses in stock indices,
softs, interest rates, energies and metals.  

April
was another volatile month of fluctuating trendless price action. These kinds of market conditions wreak havoc for technical trend
following systems like EMC.  

  Class
A Units were negative 3.21% in May 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,105.82 as of May 31, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were negative 0.02% in May 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,439.23 as of May 31, 2015.  

The
Everest Fund had a loss of -3.21% in May. Another month of abrupt price swings saw losses in metals, currencies, softs, stock
indices and short financials. Smaller gains were posted in grains and to a lesser extent long financials and energies.  

  May
was another month of unfavorable conditions for trend followers like EMC. We look forward to the possibility of a return to trending,
and therefore tradeable, markets.  

  Class
A Units were positive 2.04% in June 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,148.71 as of June 30, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were negative 5.36% in June 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,308.49 as of June 30, 2015.  

  The
Everest Fund s gains came mostly in interest rates with smaller gains from softs and energies. Smaller overall losses came
in stock indices and grains.  

  Brexit
was the main driver of markets for the month of June. The Fund suffered losses in anticipation of the U.K. vote, and then made
up the losses plus 2% after the Brexit vote to leave the EU. We were impressed by the risk management at EMC, especially after
the vote took place.  

Class
A Units were positive 1.57% in July 31, 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,182.45 as of July 31, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were positive 3.98% in July 31, 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,400.32 as of July 31, 2015.  

  The
Fund had profits in metals, energies, interest rates and softs. Smaller overall losses came in stock indices, grains and currencies.  

  The
gain was about one half the gain of the S P 500 for the month but it does illustrate the non-correlated aspect of the Fund.
Although many of our investors look to the Fund for negative correlation to equity markets, a  hedge  against stock
market declines, the fund is actually non correlated over time and has the potential to post profits during up periods for equity
markets as we see this month and last month.  

  Administrative
note: Change of Auditors  

  On
July 7, 2016 The Everest Fund, L.P. has dismissed its independent registered accounting firm, Donahue Associates, LLC. On August
9, 2016 they were replaced with Horwich Coleman Levin, LLC (HCL), 125 South Wacker Drive, Suite 1500, Chicago, IL 60606. Donahue
Associates, LLC was the Company s auditor for years 2009 through June 2016. HCL is a larger firm with the higher status
of PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board), which we need in order to continue our yearly and quarterly filings with
the SEC. We will not incur any additional expenses in going with new firm. The decision to change accountants was recommended
and approved by the board of directors.  

During
two most recent years and subsequent interim period before Donahue Associates, LLC were dismissed there were no disagreements
on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or procedures or compliance
with the applicable rules of the Commission. There were no reportable events under 304 (a) (1) (v) of Regulation SK. Donahue Associates,
LLC reports on the Everest Fund, L.P. s financial statements for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, did not contain any adverse
opinion, disclaimer or opinion or qualification.  

  Class
A Units were negative 6.15% in August 31, 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,048.30 as of August 31, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were negative 3.13% in August 31, 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,325.20 as of August 31, 2015.  

  Losses
were sustained from choppy markets in metals, energies, currencies, softs and interest rates. The positive performance in global
stock indices and grains was not enough to offset the up and down volatility in the other markets.

  Please
note that we have relocated to new offices, in the same building, from suite 143 to suites 230-232 as of September 1, 2016. Our
telephones, fax and e-mails remain the same.  

  Our
new address is as follows: Everest Asset Management, Inc. 1100 North 4th Street, Suite 232, Fairfield, IA 52556  

Class
A Units were negative 1.85% in September 30, 2016 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,010.44 as of September 30, 2016.  

  Class
A Units were positive 2.99% in September 30, 2015 resulting in a Net Asset Value per unit of $2,394.78 as of September 30, 2015.  

  In
another month of non-trending markets, the Fund had gains in meats and softs but larger overall losses in energies, grains, interest
rates, currencies and metals.  

  It
remains to be seen how the anticipation for the US Elections next month will affect price trends. We have confidence that EMC
will bring professionalism and discipline to the next two months.
