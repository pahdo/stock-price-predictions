INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
  Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our," "our company," "Realogy," "Realogy Holdings" and the "Company" refer to Realogy Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Realogy Intermediate Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Realogy Intermediate"), and Realogy Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Realogy Group").  Neither Realogy Holdings, the indirect parent of Realogy Group, nor Realogy Intermediate, the direct parent company of Realogy Group, conducts any operations other than with respect to its respective direct or indirect ownership of Realogy Group.  As a result, the consolidated financial positions, results of operations and cash flows of Realogy Holdings, Realogy Intermediate and Realogy Group are the same. 
  Realogy Holdings is not a party to the Senior Secured Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility and certain references in this report to our consolidated indebtedness exclude Realogy Holdings with respect to indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility.  In addition, while Realogy Holdings is a guarantor of Realogy Group's obligations under its unsecured notes, Realogy Holdings is not subject to the restrictive covenants in the indentures governing such indebtedness. 
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  Forward-looking statements included in this report and our other public filings or other public statements that we make from time to time are based on various facts and derived utilizing numerous important assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our future financial performance, business strategy, projected plans and objectives, as well as projections of macroeconomic and industry trends, which are inherently unreliable due to the multiple factors that impact economic trends, and any such variations may be material.  Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "projects," "estimates," "plans," and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "should," "would," "may" and "could" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts.  You should understand that the following important factors could affect our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: 
             
    risks related to general business, economic, employment and political conditions and the U.S. residential real estate markets, either regionally or nationally, including but not limited to:

    continued or lengthier delays in homesale transaction closings that impact us or other industry participants resulting from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule relating to integrated mortgage disclosure forms, which became effective for new loan applications beginning October 3, 2015; 
                
    a decrease in housing affordability;

    our failure or alleged failure to comply with laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations and any changes in laws and regulations or stricter interpretations of regulatory requirements, including but not limited to (1) state or federal employment laws or regulations that would require reclassification of independent contractor sales associates to employee status; and (2) RESPA or state consumer protection or similar laws;

    our inability to securitize certain assets of our relocation business, which would require us to find an alternative source of liquidity that may not be available, or if available, may not be on favorable terms; 
                
    risks that could materially adversely impact our equity investment in PHH Home Loans LLC, our joint venture with PHH Corporation ("PHH") including increases in mortgage rates, the impact of joint venture operational or liquidity risks, regulatory changes, litigation, investigations and inquiries and termination of the venture;

You should consider these factors in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made by us and our businesses generally.   
  Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events unless we are required to do so by law.  For any forward-looking statement contained in this Report, our public filings or other public statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Realogy Holdings Corp.: 
  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Realogy Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
    
  We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 24, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements which included a paragraph that described the change in the manner of accounting for the presentation of debt issuance costs and the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes in 2015 and retrospectively for prior years.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

REALOGY HOLDINGS CORP. AND REALOGY GROUP LLC 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are in millions) 
  (Unaudited) 
   
           1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
     Realogy Holdings Corp. ("Realogy Holdings", "Realogy" or the "Company") is a holding company for its consolidated subsidiaries including Realogy Intermediate Holdings LLC ("Realogy Intermediate") and Realogy Group LLC ("Realogy Group") and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Realogy through its subsidiaries is a global provider of residential real estate services.  Neither Realogy Holdings, the indirect parent of Realogy Group, nor Realogy Intermediate, the direct parent company of Realogy Group, conducts any operations other than with respect to its respective direct or indirect ownership of Realogy Group.  As a result, the consolidated financial positions, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of Realogy Holdings, Realogy Intermediate and Realogy Group are the same. 
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of Realogy Holdings and Realogy Group.  Realogy Holdings' only asset is its investment in the common stock of Realogy Intermediate, and Realogy Intermediate's only asset is its investment in Realogy Group.  Realogy Holdings' only obligations are its guarantees of certain borrowings and certain franchise obligations of Realogy Group.  All expenses incurred by Realogy Holdings and Realogy Intermediate are for the benefit of Realogy Group and have been reflected in Realogy Group's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Interim results may not be indicative of full year performance because of seasonal and short-term variations.  The Company has eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between entities consolidated in these financial statements.  In presenting the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and the related disclosures.  Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information.  Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.   
   In management's opinion, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly Realogy Holdings and Realogy Group's financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and the results of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and cash flows   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  As the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using the same accounting principles and policies used to prepare the annual consolidated financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  The following tables present the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. 
                   Level Input: 
      
    Input Definitions: 

Level I 
      
    Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the  
  measurement date. 

Level II 
      
    Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level I that are observable for the asset or liability through  
  corroboration with market data at the measurement date. 

Level III 
      
    Unobservable inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in  
  pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 

The availability of observable inputs can vary from asset to asset and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of asset, whether the asset is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.  To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.  Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level III.  In certain cases, the  

10 

     Table of Contents  

inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
  The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to quoted market values.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques, as appropriate.  The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined based upon a discounted cash flow approach.  
  The Company measures financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis and recognizes transfers within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred.  There have been no transfers between Level I, II or III assets or liabilities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at   September 30, 2016   for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The fair value of the Company s contingent consideration for acquisitions is measured using a probability weighted-average discount rate to estimate future cash flows based upon the likelihood of achieving future operating results for individual acquisitions.  These assumptions are deemed to be unobservable inputs and as such the Company s contingent consideration is classified within Level III of the valuation hierarchy.  The Company reassesses the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on a quarterly basis. 
  The following table presents changes in Level III financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

_______________ 
           (a) 
    The fair value of the Company's indebtedness is categorized as Level I. 
     Investment in PHH Home Loans 
  The Company owns   49.9%   of PHH Home Loans, a mortgage origination venture formed in 2005 created for the purpose of originating and selling mortgage loans primarily sourced through the Company s real estate brokerage and relocation businesses.  PHH Corporation ("PHH") owns the remaining percentage.  
  In connection with the joint venture, the Company recorded equity earnings related to its investment in PHH Home Loans of   $4 million   and   $3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and   $7 million   and   $11 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The Company received   $3 million   in cash dividends from PHH Home Loans during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $5 million   in cash dividends during the same period in   2015  .  The Company's investment in PHH Home Loans is   $63 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $58 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company's provision for income taxes in interim periods is computed by applying its estimated annual effective tax rate against the income before income taxes for the period.  In addition, non-recurring or discrete items are recorded during the period in which they occur.  The provision for income taxes was an expense of   $74 million   for both of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   and   $114 million   and   $116 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Derivative Instruments  
  The Company records derivatives and hedging activities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values.  The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts largely to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.  The Company primarily manages its foreign currency exposure to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and British Pound.  The Company has not elected to utilize hedge accounting for these forward contracts; therefore, any change in fair value is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  However, the fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts generally offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk that they are intended to economically hedge.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a fair value of less than   $1 million   and a notional value of   $35 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a fair value of less than   $1 million   and a notional value of   $33 million  .

The Company also enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates associated with its variable rate borrowings.  The Company has interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of   $1,475 million   to offset the variability in cash flows resulting from the term loan facilities as follows:   

The swaps help to protect our outstanding variable rate borrowings from future interest rate volatility.  The Company has not elected to utilize hedge accounting for these interest rate swaps; therefore, any change in fair value is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The fair value of derivative instruments was as follows:

Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash primarily relates to amounts specifically designated as collateral for the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the Company s securitization facilities.  Such amounts approximated   $10 million   and   $8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included within other current assets on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Supplemental Cash Flow Information  
  Significant non-cash transactions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   included capital lease additions of   $10 million   and   $13 million  , respectively, which resulted in non-cash additions to property and equipment, net and other non-current liabilities. 
  Stock Repurchases 
  The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under authorizations made from its Board of Directors.   Shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the consolidated financial statements.  The par value of the shares repurchased and retired is deducted from common stock and the excess of the purchase price over par value is first charged against any available additional paid-in capital with the balance charged to retained earnings.  Direct costs incurred to repurchase the shares are included in the total cost of the shares. 
  In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $275 million   of the Company s common stock.  From the date of authorization through   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased and retired   4.5 million   shares of common stock for   $134 million   at a weighted average market price of   $29.49   per share. 
  Dividend Policy 
  In August 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy on its common stock.  The Board declared a cash dividend of   $0.09   per share of the Company s common stock, paid on August 31, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 17, 2016. 

13 

     Table of Contents  

The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions, including restrictive covenants contained in the Company s credit agreements, and the indentures governing the Company s outstanding debt securities, capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. 
  Pursuant to the Company s policy, the dividends payable in cash are treated as a reduction of additional paid-in capital since the Company is currently in a retained deficit position. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , amending guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting.  The Company elected to early adopt this ASU in the third quarter of 2016 using a modified retrospective approach, effective as if adopted the first day of the fiscal year, January 1, 2016.  Adoption of the new guidance resulted in the following: 
             
    The new ASU requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled and will be applied on a prospective basis.  Any excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable are to be recorded on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period in which the new guidance is adopted.  The Company recorded a cumulative increase of   $5 million   to its January 1, 2016 accumulated deficit balance with a corresponding decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to the prior years' unrecognized excess tax benefits. 
                
    Furthermore, the guidance requires that income taxes paid by the Company related to the net share settlement for stock-based compensation be presented as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows and requires retrospective application.  The Company applied this cash flow presentation change which resulted in the reclassification of   $6 million   and   $5 million   of taxes paid related to net share settlements of stock-based compensation awards from operating activities to financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
                
    In addition, the Company elected to account for forfeitures on share-based payment awards in compensation cost as they occur as opposed to estimating forfeitures.  The cumulative impact for the forfeiture change was immaterial and was recorded as a decrease to the January 1, 2016 accumulated deficit balance.  The current year impact for the change was immaterial and was recognized in the third quarter of 2016. 
     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates.  ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued a new standard on classification of cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows intending to reduce diversity in practice on how certain transactions are classified.  The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will require a retrospective application at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued its new standard on leases which requires virtually all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.  Lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease).  The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments.  The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs.  For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases.  Operating leases will result in straight-line expense, similar to current operating leases, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern, similar to current capital leases.  Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines.  The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The new leasing standard requires modified retrospective transition, which requires application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In May 2014, the FASB issued a standard on revenue recognition that will impact most companies to some extent.  The objective of the revenue standard is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets.  The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition.  The new standard permits for two alternative implementation methods, the use of either (1) full retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented or (2) modified retrospective application in which the cumulative effect of initially applying the revenue standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  The Company plans to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 but has not yet determined the method by which the standard will be adopted.  The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the financial results of the Company as the majority of our revenue is recognized at the completion of a homesale transaction which will not be impacted by this new revenue recognition guidance.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on other revenue streams.

    ACQUISITIONS  
     2016 Acquisitions 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   nine   real estate brokerage and property management operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, NRT, for aggregate cash consideration of   $74 million   and established   $9 million   of contingent consideration.  These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of   $52 million  , customer relationships of   $20 million  , pendings and listings of   $6 million  , other intangible assets of   $3 million  , other assets of   $4 million   and other liabilities of   $2 million  . 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired   one   title and settlement operation through its wholly owned subsidiary, TRG, for cash consideration of   $24 million   and established   $10 million   of contingent consideration.  This acquisition resulted in goodwill of   $20 million  , title plant of   $7 million  , pendings of   $5 million  , trademarks of   $3 million  , other intangible assets of   $2 million  , other assets of   $6 million   and other liabilities of   $9 million  . 
  None of the 2016 acquisitions were significant to the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows individually or in the aggregate.

respectively, as well as   $155 million   of revolver borrowings under the revolving credit facility which expires in October 2020. 
  Senior Secured Credit Facility 
  In July 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to the senior secured credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement").  The third amendment replaced the existing   $1,858 million   Term Loan B due March 2020 with a new   $1,100 million   Term Loan B due July 20, 2022.  In addition, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Term Loan A Agreement under which the Company borrowed a new tranche of term loans under its Term Loan A Facility ("Term Loan A-1") in the amount of   $355 million   with a maturity date in July 2021 (see "Term Loan A Facility" section below for more information on the issuance of the Term Loan A-1).  The majority of the financing costs incurred for these transactions were deferred over the life of the agreement in accordance with debt modification accounting guidance.  
  In October 2015, Realogy Group entered into a second amendment to the senior secured credit agreement.  The second amendment provided for a   five  -year,   $815 million   revolving credit facility and included a   $125 million   letter of credit sub-facility.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company moved outstanding letters of credit to the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility and terminated the synthetic letter of credit facility.  See the "Other Debt Facilities" section below for more information.  The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for:   
           (a)  
    a Term Loan B issued in the aggregate principal amount of   $1,100 million   with a maturity date of July 2022.  The Term Loan B has quarterly amortization payments totaling   1%   per annum of the initial aggregate principal amount.  The interest rate with respect to term loans under the Term Loan B is based on, at Realogy Group's option, adjusted   LIBOR   plus   3.00%   (with a   LIBOR   floor of   0.75%  ) or   ABR   plus   2.00%   (with an   ABR   floor of   1.75%  ); and  
              (b) 
    an   $815 million   Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity date of October 23, 2020, which includes (i) a   $125 million   letter of credit subfacility and (ii) a swingline loan subfacility.  The interest rate with respect to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on, at Realogy Group's option, adjusted   LIBOR   or   ABR   plus an additional margin subject to the following adjustments based on the Company s then current senior secured leverage ratio: 

The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement permits the Company to obtain up to   $500 million   of additional credit facilities from lenders reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent and us, without the consent of the existing lenders under the new senior secured credit facility, plus an unlimited amount if Realogy Group's senior secured leverage ratio is less than   3.50   to   1.00   on a pro forma basis.  Subject to certain restrictions, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also permits us to issue senior secured or unsecured notes in lieu of any incremental facility. 
  The obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured to the extent legally permissible by substantially all of the assets of Realogy Group, Realogy Intermediate and all of their domestic subsidiaries, other than certain excluded subsidiaries. 
  Realogy Group s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains financial, affirmative and negative covenants and requires Realogy Group to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio, not to exceed   4.75   to   1.00  , and pursuant to the second amendment discussed above, the leverage ratio is tested quarterly, commencing with the period ended September 30, 2015, regardless of the amount of borrowings outstanding and letters of credit issued under the revolver at the testing date.  In this report, the Company refers to the term "Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA" to mean EBITDA as so defined for purposes of determining compliance with the senior secured leverage covenant.  The senior secured leverage ratio measured at any applicable quarter end is Realogy Group's total senior secured net debt divided by the trailing twelve month Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA.  Total senior secured net debt does not include unsecured indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes as well as the securitization obligations.  At   September 30, 2016  , Realogy Group s senior secured leverage ratio was   2.18   to   1.00  .

Term Loan A Facility 
  In October 2015, Realogy Group entered into the Term Loan A senior secured credit agreement.  The Term Loan A Agreement provides for a   five  -year,   $435 million   loan issued at par with a maturity date of October 23, 2020 (the  Term Loan A ) and has terms substantially similar to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  The Term Loan A provides for quarterly amortization payments, which commenced March 31, 2016, totaling the amount per annum equal to the following percentages of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A:    5%  ,   5%  ,   7.5%  ,   10.0%   and   12.5%   for amortizations payable in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, with the balance payable upon the final maturity date.  The interest rates with respect to term loans under the Term Loan A are based on, at our option, adjusted LIBOR or ABR plus an additional margin subject to the following adjustments based on the Company s then current senior secured leverage ratio: 

In July 2016, Realogy Group entered into a first amendment to the Term Loan A senior secured credit agreement.  Under the amendment, the Company issued the Term Loan A-1 in the amount of   $355 million   with a maturity date in July 2021 under its existing Term Loan A Facility and on terms substantially similar to its existing Term Loan A.  The Term Loan A-1 provides for quarterly amortization payments totaling   2.5%  ,   2.5%  ,   5%  ,   7.5%   and   10.0%   of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A-1, which commenced September 30, 2016 continuing through June 30, 2021.  The interest rates with respect to term loans under the Term Loan A-1 are based on, at our option, adjusted LIBOR or ABR plus an additional margin subject to the following adjustments based on the Company s then current senior secured leverage ratio: 

Consistent with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Term Loan A Facility permits the Company to obtain up to   $500 million   of additional credit facilities from lenders reasonably satisfactory to the administrative agent and the company, without the consent of the existing lenders under the Term Loan A, plus an unlimited amount if the Company's senior secured leverage ratio is less than   3.50   to   1.00   on a pro forma basis.  Subject to certain restrictions, the Term Loan A Facility also permits us to issue senior secured or unsecured notes in lieu of any incremental facility. 
  Unsecured Notes 
  The   4.50%   Senior Notes,   5.25%   Senior Notes and   4.875%   Senior Notes (each as defined below and collectively the "Unsecured Notes") are unsecured senior obligations of Realogy Group that mature on April 15, 2019, December 1, 2021 and June 1, 2023, respectively.  Interest on the Unsecured Notes is payable each year semiannually on April 15 and October 15 for the   4.50%   Senior Notes and June 1 and December 1 for both the   5.25%   Senior Notes and   4.875%   Senior Notes. 
  In March 2016, the Company issued   5.25%   Senior Notes due 2021 of   $250 million   (the "Additional   5.25%   Senior Notes") under the same indenture as the   $300 million   of Realogy Group s   5.25%   Senior Notes due 2021 issued on November 21, 2014 (the "Existing   5.25%   Senior Notes") (collectively the "  5.25%   Senior Notes").  The Additional   5.25%   Senior Notes mature on December 1, 2021 and interest on the notes is due on June 1 and December 1 of each year with the first interest payment date of June 1, 2016.  The Additional   5.25%   Senior Notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and constitute part of the same series as the Existing   5.25%   Senior Notes. 
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company used   $400 million   of revolver borrowings and a portion of cash on hand to retire the   $500 million   of   3.375%   Senior Notes at maturity.  The Company also issued   $500 million   of   4.875%   Senior Notes (the "  4.875%   Senior Notes") due 2023 and used the proceeds to temporarily reduce revolver borrowings.  The   4.875%

     Table of Contents  

Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023 and interest on the   4.875%   Notes is due on June 1 and December 1 of each year with the first interest payment date of December 1, 2016.   
  The Unsecured Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each domestic subsidiary of Realogy Group that is a guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and Realogy Group's outstanding debt securities and are guaranteed by Realogy Holdings on an unsecured senior subordinated basis. 
  Other Debt Facilities 
  The Company has an Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility to provide for the issuance of letters of credit required for general corporate purposes by the Company.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company increased the capacity under the facility by   $47 million   from   $88 million   to   $135 million  .  The facility's expiration dates are as follows: 

The fixed pricing to the Company is based on a spread above the credit default swap rate for senior unsecured debt obligations of the Company over the applicable letter of credit period.  Realogy Group's obligations under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each domestic subsidiary of Realogy Group that is a guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and Realogy Group's outstanding debt securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $128 million   of the Facility is being utilized. 
  Securitization Obligations  
  Realogy Group has secured obligations through Apple Ridge Funding LLC under a securitization program.  In June 2016, Realogy Group extended the program until June 2017.  The program has a capacity of   $325 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , Realogy Group has   $240 million   of outstanding borrowings under the facility.  
  Realogy Group, through a special purpose entity known as Cartus Financing Limited, has agreements providing for a    10 million   revolving loan facility and a    5 million   working capital facility, both of which expire on October 31, 2016.  In October 2016, Realogy Group extended the facility to August 2017.  There are   $15 million   of outstanding borrowings on the facilities at   September 30, 2016  .  These Cartus Financing Limited facilities are secured by the relocation assets of a U.K. government contract in this special purpose entity and are therefore classified as permitted securitization financings as defined in Realogy Group s Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes. 
  The Apple Ridge entities and the Cartus Financing Limited entity are consolidated special purpose entities that are utilized to securitize relocation receivables and related assets.  These assets are generated from advancing funds on behalf of clients of Realogy Group s relocation business in order to facilitate the relocation of their employees.  Assets of these special purpose entities are not available to pay Realogy Group s general obligations.  Under the Apple Ridge program, provided no termination or amortization event has occurred, any new receivables generated under the designated relocation management agreements are sold into the securitization program and as new eligible relocation management agreements are entered into, the new agreements are designated to the program.  The Apple Ridge program has restrictive covenants and trigger events, including performance triggers linked to the age and quality of the underlying assets, foreign obligor limits, multicurrency limits, financial reporting requirements, restrictions on mergers and change of control, any uncured breach of Realogy Group s senior secured leverage ratio under Realogy Group s Senior Secured Credit Facility, and cross-defaults to Realogy Group s material indebtedness.  The occurrence of a trigger event under the Apple Ridge securitization facility could restrict our ability to access new or existing funding under this facility or result in termination of the facility, either of which would adversely affect the operation of our relocation business. 
  Certain of the funds that Realogy Group receives from relocation receivables and related assets must be utilized to repay securitization obligations.  These obligations were collateralized by   $282 million   and   $281 million   of underlying relocation receivables and other related relocation assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Substantially all relocation related assets are realized in less than twelve months from the transaction date.  Accordingly, all of Realogy Group s securitization obligations are classified as current in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Interest incurred in connection with borrowings under these facilities amounted to   $2 million   and   $5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively and   $1 million   and   $4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This interest is recorded within net revenues in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as related borrowings are utilized to fund Realogy Group's relocation business where interest is generally earned on such assets.  These securitization obligations represent floating rate debt for which the average weighted interest rate was   2.5%   and   2.0%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    RESTRUCTURING COSTS  
     The restructuring charge for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $9 million   and   $30 million  , respectively.  The components of the restructuring charges for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Personnel-related costs consist of severance costs provided to employees who have been terminated and duplicate payroll costs during transition. 
              (2) 
    Facility-related costs consist of costs associated with planned facility closures such as contract termination costs, lease payments that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company and other facility and employee relocation related costs. 
              (3) 
    Other restructuring costs consist of costs related to professional fees, consulting fees and other costs associated with restructuring activities which are primarily included in the Corporate and Other business segment. 
     Business Optimization Initiative 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company began a business optimization initiative that focuses on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the cost structure of each of the Company's business units.  The action is designed to improve client service levels across each of the business units while enhancing the Company's profitability and incremental margins.  The plan focuses on several key areas of opportunity which include process improvement efficiencies, office footprint optimization, leveraging technology and media spend, centralized procurement, outsourcing administrative services and organizational design.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company expanded the scope of restructuring activities in order to realign the Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services back office administration and support functions across the country.  As a result of this realignment, the expected costs of activities undertaken in connection with the restructuring plan are expected to be largely incurred by mid-2017. 
  The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring reserve balances for the Business Optimization Initiative:

    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
     The Company has stock-based compensation plans (the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan) under which incentive equity awards such as non-qualified stock options, rights to purchase shares of common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance restricted stock units and performance share units ("PSUs") may be issued to employees, consultants and directors of Realogy.  The Company's stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 4, 2016 (the "Amended and Restated 2012 LTIP").  The Amended and Restated 2012 LTIP increases the number of shares authorized for issuance under that plan by   9.8 million   shares.  The total number of shares authorized for issuance under the plans is   19.4 million   shares.   
  Awards granted under the Amended and Restated 2012 LTIP utilizing the additional   9.8 million   share reserve, except options and stock appreciation rights, must be counted against the foregoing share limit on a   2.22   share to one basis for each share actually granted in connection with such award.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total number of shares available for future grants under the Amended and Restated 2012 LTIP was   7.9 million   shares.  The Company does not expect to issue any additional awards under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. 
  Consistent with the 2015 long-term incentive equity awards, the 2016 awards include a mix of PSUs, RSUs (performance restricted stock units for the CEO and direct reports) and options.  The 2016 PSUs are incentives that reward grantees based upon the Company's financial performance over a   three  -year performance period ending December 31, 2018.  There are   two   PSU awards:    one   is based upon the total stockholder return of Realogy's common stock relative to the total stockholder return of the SPDR S P Homebuilders Index ("XHB") (the "RTSR award"), and the other is based upon the achievement of cumulative free cash flow goals.  The number of shares that may be issued under the PSU is variable and based upon the extent to which the performance goals are achieved over the performance period (with a range of payout from   0%   to   175%   of target for the RTSR award and   0%   to   200%   of target for the achievement of cumulative free cash flow award).  The shares earned will be distributed in early 2019.  The RSUs vest over   three   years, with   33.33%   vesting on each anniversary of the grant date.  Time-vesting of the 2016 performance RSUs for the CEO and direct reports is subject to achievement of a minimum EBITDA performance goal for 2016.  The stock options have a maximum term of   ten   years and vest over   four   years, with   25%   vesting on each anniversary date of the grant date.  The options have an exercise price equal to the closing sale price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.   
  The options, RSUs and the PSUs based upon RTSR included in the 2016 long-term incentive plan were granted in February 2016.  The performance RSUs and the PSUs based upon achievement of cumulative free cash flow aggregating   0.4 million   shares subject to those awards at target were also awarded in February 2016, but the grant was subject to approval of the Amended and Restated 2012 LTIP.  The stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2012 LTIP at the May 4, 2016

Annual Meeting and we have accordingly treated May 4, 2016 as the grant date for these awards and are expensing those awards from that date over the balance of the vesting or performance period. 
  In August 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy on its common stock.  The Board declared a cash dividend of   $0.09   per share of the Company s common stock per quarter.  When payment of cash dividends occurs, the Company issues dividend equivalent units ("DEUs") to eligible holders of outstanding RSUs and PSUs.  The number of DEUs granted for each RSU or PSU is calculated by dividing the amount of the cash dividend on the number of shares covered by the RSU or PSU at the time of the related dividend record date by the closing price of the Company's stock on the related dividend payment date.  The DEUs are subject to the same vesting requirements, settlement provisions, and other terms and conditions as the original award to which they relate.  The issuance of DEUs have an immaterial impact on the Company's stock-based compensation activity. 
  The fair value of RSUs and PSUs without a market condition is equal to the closing sale price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The fair value of the RTSR PSU award was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Simulation method utilizing the following assumptions.  Expected volatility was based on historical volatilities of the Company and select comparable companies.

The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  Expected volatility was based on historical volatilities of the Company and select comparable companies.  The expected term of the options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant, which corresponds to the expected term of the options.

     Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , based on current performance achievement expectations, there was   $47 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to incentive equity awards under the plans which will be recorded in future periods as compensation expense over a remaining weighted average period of approximately   1.2 years  .  The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to the incentive equity awards of   $14 million   and   $39 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $14 million   and   $40 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
  In the third quarter of 2016, the Company early adopted ASU "  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting"   permitting the Company to elect to account for forfeitures on share-based payment awards in compensation cost as they occur as opposed to estimating forfeitures.  See Note 1 "  Basis of Presentation  " for further information on the adoption of this new standard.

    TRANSACTIONS WITH FORMER PARENT AND SUBSIDIARIES 
     Transfer of Cendant Corporate Liabilities and Issuance of Guarantees to Cendant and Affiliates  
  Realogy Group (then Realogy Corporation) separated from Cendant on July 31, 2006 (the "Separation"), pursuant to a plan by Cendant (now known as Avis Budget Group, Inc.) to separate into   four   independent companies   one   for each of Cendant's business units real estate services (Realogy), travel distribution services ("Travelport"), hospitality services, including timeshare resorts ("Wyndham Worldwide"), and vehicle rental ("Avis Budget Group").  Realogy Group has certain guarantee commitments with Cendant (pursuant to the assumption of certain liabilities and the obligation to indemnify Cendant, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport for such liabilities).  These guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities, contingent tax liabilities, and other corporate liabilities, of which Realogy Group assumed and is generally responsible for   62.5%  .  Upon separation from Cendant, the liabilities assumed by Realogy Group were comprised of certain Cendant corporate liabilities which were recorded on the historical books of Cendant as well as additional liabilities which were established for guarantees issued at the date of Separation related to certain unresolved contingent matters that could arise during the guarantee period.  Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies

     Table of Contents  

responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, Realogy Group would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties  obligation.  To the extent such recorded liabilities are in excess or are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts, such excess or deficiency will be reflected in the results of operations in future periods.  
  The due to former parent balance was   $31 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The due to former parent balance was comprised of the Company s portion of the following: (i) Cendant s remaining state and foreign contingent tax liabilities, (ii) accrued interest on contingent tax liabilities, (iii) potential liabilities related to Cendant s terminated or divested businesses, and (iv) potential liabilities related to the residual portion of accruals for Cendant operations.  
   
  9.     EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Earnings per share attributable to Realogy Holdings 
  Basic earnings per share is computed based on net income attributable to Realogy Holdings stockholders divided by the basic weighted-average shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive earnings per share is computed consistently with the basic computation while giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares and common share equivalents that were outstanding during the period.  Realogy Holdings uses the treasury stock method to reflect the potential dilutive effect of unvested stock awards and unexercised options.  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

_______________    
           (a) 
    The   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   respectively exclude   5.2 million   and   5.1 million   shares of common stock issuable for incentive equity awards, which include performance share units based on the achievement of target amounts that are anti-dilutive to the diluted earnings per share computation.  The   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   respectively exclude   3.6 million   and   3.7 million   shares of common stock issuable for incentive equity awards, which include performance share units based on the achievement of target amounts that are anti-dilutive to the diluted earnings per share computation. 
     In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $275 million   of the Company s common stock.  From the date of authorization through   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased and retired   4.5 million   shares of common stock for   $134 million   at a weighted average market price of   $29.49   per share.  The purchase of shares under this plan reduces the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the basic earnings per share calculation.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
     Litigation  
  The Company is involved in claims, legal proceedings, alternative dispute resolution and governmental inquiries related to alleged contract disputes, business practices, intellectual property and other commercial, employment, regulatory and tax matters.  Examples of such matters include but are not limited to allegations: 
             
    that the Company is vicariously liable for the acts of franchisees under theories of actual or apparent agency;  
                
    by former franchisees that franchise agreements were breached including improper terminations;  
                
    that residential real estate sales associates engaged by NRT under certain state or federal laws are potentially employees instead of independent contractors, and they or regulators therefore may bring claims against NRT for

     Table of Contents  

breach of contract, wage and hour classification claims, wrongful discharge, unemployment and workers' compensation and could obtain benefits, back wages, overtime, indemnification, penalties related to classification practices and expense reimbursement available to employees;  
             
    concerning claims for alleged RESPA or state real estate law violations including but not limited to claims challenging the validity of sales associates indemnification, and administrative fees;  
                
    concerning claims generally against the company owned brokerage operations for negligence, misrepresentation or breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the performance of real estate brokerage or other professional services as well as other brokerage claims associated with listing information and property history; 
                
    concerning claims generally against the title company contending that, as the escrow company, the company knew or should have known that a transaction was fraudulent or concerning other title defects or settlement errors; and 
                
    concerning information security and cyber crime.  
     Real Estate Business Litigation  
  Strader, et al. and Hall v. PHH Corporation, et al.   (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California).  This is a purported class action brought by four California residents against 15 defendants, including Realogy and certain of its subsidiaries, PHH Corporation and PHH Home Loans, LLC (a joint venture between Realogy and PHH), alleging violations of Section 8(a) of RESPA.  Plaintiffs seek to represent two subclasses comprised of all persons in the United States who, since January 31, 2005, (1) obtained a RESPA-covered mortgage loan from either (a) PHH Home Loans, LLC or one of its subsidiaries, or (b) one of the mortgage services managed by PHH Corporation for other lenders, and (2) paid a fee for title insurance or settlement services to TRG or one of its subsidiaries.  Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that PHH Home Loans, LLC operates in violation of RESPA and that the other defendants violate RESPA by referring business to one another under agreements or arrangements.  Plaintiffs seek treble damages and an award of attorneys  fees, costs and disbursements.  On February 5, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case claiming that not only do the claims lack merit, but they are time-barred under RESPA's one-year statute of limitations.  On April 5, 2016, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss with leave for the plaintiffs to amend their complaint.  Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on April 21, 2016, and a third amended complaint on May 12, 2016.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint.  The Court denied the motion on October 6, 2016, without prejudice to defendants  ability to move for summary judgment after discovery.  The parties are proceeding with discovery. 
  The case raises significant claims and rests in part on certain interpretations of RESPA by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which are the subject of pending industry litigation in various jurisdictions.  As with all class action litigation, the case is inherently complex and subject to many uncertainties.  We believe that we and the joint venture have complied with RESPA, the regulations promulgated thereunder and existing regulatory guidance.  There can be no assurance, however, that if the action continues and a large class is subsequently certified, the plaintiffs will not seek a substantial damage award, penalties and other remedies.  Given the early stage of this case and the novel claims and issues presented, we cannot estimate a range of reasonably potential losses for this litigation.  The Company will vigorously defend this action. 
  The Company is involved in certain other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business.  Such litigation, regulatory actions and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, franchising arrangements, actions against our title company alleging it knew or should have known that others were committing mortgage fraud, standard brokerage disputes like the failure to disclose hidden defects in the property such as mold, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including franchisees and independent sales associates, antitrust and anti-competition claims, general fraud claims, employment law claims, including claims challenging the classification of our sales associates as independent contractors, wage and hour classification claims, and claims alleging violations of RESPA or state consumer fraud statutes.  While the results of such claims and legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe based on information currently available to us that the final outcome of current proceedings against the Company will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Cendant Corporate Litigation  
  Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of July 27, 2006 among Cendant, Realogy Group, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport, each of Realogy Group, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport have assumed certain contingent and other corporate liabilities (and related costs and expenses), which are primarily related to each of their respective businesses.  In addition, Realogy Group has assumed   62.5%   and Wyndham Worldwide has assumed   37.5%   of  

27 

     Table of Contents  

certain contingent and other corporate liabilities (and related costs and expenses) of Cendant or its subsidiaries, which are not primarily related to any of the respective businesses of Realogy Group, Wyndham Worldwide, Travelport and/or Cendant s vehicle rental operations, in each case incurred or allegedly incurred on or prior to the date of the separation of Travelport from Cendant.  
  * * * 
  The Company believes that it has adequately accrued for legal matters as appropriate.  The Company records litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable.  
  Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur.  In addition, class action lawsuits can be costly to defend and, depending on the class size and claims, could be costly to settle.  As such, the Company could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims with liability that are materially in excess of amounts accrued and these settlements could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.  
  Tax Matters  
  The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and recording related assets and liabilities.  In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities whereby the outcome of the audits is uncertain.  The Company believes there is appropriate support for positions taken on its tax returns.  The liabilities that have been recorded represent the best estimates of the probable loss on certain positions and are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.  However, the outcomes of tax audits are inherently uncertain. 
  Under the Tax Sharing Agreement with Cendant, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport, the Company is generally responsible for   62.5%   of payments made to settle claims with respect to tax periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2006 that relate to income taxes imposed on Cendant and certain of its subsidiaries, the operations (or former operations) of which were determined by Cendant not to relate specifically to the respective businesses of Realogy, Wyndham Worldwide, Avis Budget or Travelport.   
  With respect to any remaining legacy Cendant tax liabilities, the Company and its former parent believe there is appropriate support for the positions taken on Cendant s tax returns.  However, tax audits and any related litigation, including disputes or litigation on the allocation of tax liabilities between parties under the Tax Sharing Agreement, could result in outcomes for the Company that are different from those reflected in the Company s historical financial statements.  
  Contingent Liability Letter of Credit  
  In April 2007, the Company established a standby irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of Avis Budget Group in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement.  The synthetic letter of credit was utilized to support the Company s payment obligations with respect to its share of Cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities.  The stated amount of the standby irrevocable letter of credit is subject to periodic adjustment to reflect the then current estimate of Cendant contingent and other liabilities.  The letter of credit was   $53 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The standby irrevocable letter of credit will be terminated if (i) the Company s senior unsecured credit rating is raised to BB by Standard and Poor s or Ba2 by Moody s or (ii) the aggregate value of the former parent contingent liabilities falls below   $30 million  . 
  Escrow and Trust Deposits  
  As a service to its customers, the Company administers escrow and trust deposits which represent undisbursed amounts received for the settlement of real estate transactions.  Deposits at FDIC-insured institutions are insured up to   $250 thousand  .  These escrow and trust deposits totaled   $449 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $308 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  These escrow and trust deposits are not assets of the Company and, therefore, are excluded from the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  However, the Company remains contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein and with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in the 2015 Form 10-K.  Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts in tables are in millions.  Neither Realogy Holdings, the indirect parent of Realogy Group, nor Realogy Intermediate, the direct parent company of Realogy Group, conducts any operations other than with respect to its respective direct or indirect ownership of Realogy Group.  As a result, the condensed consolidated financial positions, results of operations and cash flows of Realogy Holdings, Realogy Intermediate and Realogy Group are the same.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements.  See "Forward-Looking Statements" in this report and "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.  Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
   
  OVERVIEW 
  We are a global provider of real estate and relocation services and report our operations in the following four segments: 
             
    Real Estate Franchise Services   (known as Realogy Franchise Group or RFG) franchises the Century 21       , Coldwell Banker       , Coldwell Banker Commercial       , ERA       , Sotheby's International Realty        and Better Homes and Gardens        Real Estate brand names.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our franchise systems had approximately   13,650   franchised and company owned offices and approximately   268,000   independent sales associates operating under our franchise and proprietary brands in the U.S. and   110   other countries and territories around the world, which included approximately   800   of our company owned and operated brokerage offices with approximately   48,000   independent sales associates.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ZapLabs is a developer of a proprietary technology platform for real estate brokerages, independent sales associates and customers.  Through the first nine months of 2016, we have rolled out ZapLabs' comprehensive, integrated ZAP   SM    technology platform to approximately   1,200   of our approximately   2,600   franchisees and, consistent with our previously disclosed plan, anticipate rolling this product out to a broader franchisee base over the next two years.  We believe the ZAP technology platform will increase the value proposition to our franchisees, their independent sales associates and their customers.  
                
    Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services   (known as NRT) operates a full-service real estate brokerage business principally under the Coldwell Banker       , Corcoran       , Sotheby s International Realty       , Citi Habitats   SM    and ZipRealty        brand names in more than   50   of the   100   largest metropolitan areas in the U.S.  This segment also includes the Company's share of earnings for our PHH Home Loans venture. 
                
    Relocation Services   (known as Cartus       ) primarily offers clients employee relocation services such as homesale assistance, providing home equity advances to transferees (generally guaranteed by the client), home finding and other destination services, expense processing, relocation policy counseling and consulting services, arranging household goods moving services, coordinating visa and immigration support, intercultural and language training and group move management services.  In addition, we provide home buying and selling assistance to members of affinity clients. 
                
    Title and Settlement Services   (known as Title Resource Group or TRG) provides full-service title and settlement services to real estate companies, affinity groups, corporations and financial institutions with many of these services provided in connection with the Company's real estate brokerage and relocation services business. 
     RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
  Business Optimization Initiative 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company began a business optimization initiative that focuses on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the cost structure of each of the Company's business units.  The action is designed to improve client service levels across each of the business units while enhancing the Company's profitability and incremental margins.  The plan focuses on several key areas of opportunity which include process improvement efficiencies, office footprint optimization, leveraging technology and media spend, centralized procurement, outsourcing administrative services and organizational design.  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company expanded the scope of restructuring activities in order to realign the Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services back office administration and support functions across the country.  As a result of this realignment, the expected costs of activities undertaken in connection with the restructuring plan are expected to be largely completed by mid-2017.  Total expected restructuring costs of approximately   $69 million   are currently anticipated to be incurred.

     Table of Contents  

Cost savings related to the restructuring initiatives are estimated to be approximately   $60 million   on an annual run rate basis with approximately   $30 million   of those cost savings expected to be realized in 2016.  The   $60 million   of estimated cost savings is expected to be realized on an annual run rate basis by each reportable segment as follows:    $5 million   at RFG,   $44 million   at NRT,   $8 million   at Cartus,   $1 million   at TRG and   $2 million   at Corporate. 
  The following table reflects the total amount of restructuring costs expected to be incurred for the business optimization initiative by reportable segment: 

Share Repurchase Plan 
  In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $275 million   of the Company s common stock.  From the date of authorization through   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased and retired   4.5 million   shares of common stock for   $134 million   at a weighted average market price of   $29.49   per share. 
  Cash Dividends 
  On August 3, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy on its common stock.  The Company paid a $0.09 per share dividend on August 31, 2016 and the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share of the Company s common stock to be paid on December 1, 2016, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 17, 2016. 
  Debt Transactions 
  In July 2016, the Company refinanced its existing $1,858 million Term Loan B due July 2020.  The new Term Loan B was issued at par in the amount of $1,100 million with a maturity date in July 2022.  Concurrently, the Company borrowed a new tranche of term loans under its Term Loan A Facility ("Term Loan A-1") in the amount of $355 million with a maturity date in July 2021 and terms substantially similar to its existing Term Loan A.  The Company used the net proceeds from the Term Loan B and Term Loan A-1, along with revolver borrowings of $225 million and cash on hand, to repay the existing Term Loan B, reducing Term Loan B borrowings from $1,858 million to $1,100 million. 
  CURRENT INDUSTRY TRENDS 
  During the first nine months of 2016, according to the National Association of Realtors ("NAR"), homesale transaction volume increased   7%   due to an increase in the number of homesale transactions, as well as homesale price growth.  RFG and NRT homesale transaction volume on a combined basis increased   3%   in the first nine months of 2016.  At NRT specifically, we have seen the slowing of activity at the high end of the market, the cumulative impact of market share attrition, and inventory issues in the mid and lower priced homes in the major markets in which NRT operates.  In the first nine months of 2016, NRT experienced a decline in homesale prices of   1%   and a flat level of homesale transactions.  At NRT, sales volume at the $2.5 million and higher homesale price points decreased from 19% of total volume in the first nine months of 2015 to 17% in 2016. 
  Recruitment and retention of independent sales associates and independent sales associate teams are critical to the business and financial results of a brokerage, including our company owned brokerages and those operated by our affiliated franchisees.  Most of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of their independent sales associates, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated leads.  Competition for independent sales associates in our industry is high, has intensified particularly with respect to more productive independent sales associates and has resulted in a decline of our market share at NRT, as well as at RFG to a lesser extent.  Competition for independent sales associates is generally subject to numerous factors, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales associates), other expenses charged to independent sales associates, leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales associate from the brokerage, independent sales associates

perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage, the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales associates with whom they collaborate daily and technology, continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage.  We believe that the influence of independent sales associates and independent sales associate teams has increased during the housing recovery and, together with the increasing competition from other brokerages, has negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of independent sales associates and put pressure on commission rate splits.  See "Key Drivers" for the Company's incremental actions that are being undertaken to address the competition for independent sales associates.  
  According to NAR, the inventory of existing homes for sale in the U.S. was   2.0 million   homes at the end of   September 2016  .  The   September 2016   inventory represents a national average supply of   4.5   months at the current homesales pace which is significantly below the 6.3 month 25-year average. 
  As reported by NAR, the housing affordability index has continued to be at historically favorable levels.  An index above 100 signifies that a family earning the median income has sufficient income to purchase a median-priced home, assuming a 20 percent down payment and ability to qualify for a mortgage.  The composite housing affordability index was   168   for   September 2016   and   166   for   2015  .  The housing affordability index remains significantly higher than the average of   126   for the period from 1970 through 2015. 
  Mortgage rates continue to be at low levels by historical standards, which we believe has helped stimulate demand in the residential real estate market.  According to Freddie Mac, mortgage rates on commitments for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate first mortgage averaged   3.9%   for 2015 and the rate at   September 30, 2016   was   3.5%  .  To the extent that mortgage rates increase, consumers continue to have financing alternatives such as adjustable rate mortgages or shorter term mortgages which can be utilized to obtain a lower mortgage rate than a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. 
  Partially offsetting the positive impact of low mortgage rates are low housing inventory levels and the ongoing rise in home prices, conservative mortgage underwriting standards and certain homeowners having limited or negative equity in homes.  Mortgage credit conditions tightened significantly during the recent housing downturn, with banks limiting credit availability to more creditworthy borrowers and requiring larger down payments, stricter appraisal standards, and more extensive mortgage documentation.  Although mortgage credit conditions appear to be easing, mortgages remain less available to some borrowers and it frequently takes longer to close a homesale transaction due to current mortgage and underwriting requirements. 
  Beginning on October 3, 2015, CFPB's new three-day advance closing disclosure rule, known as TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure ("TRID"), became effective for new loan applications and is a significant change for the industry.  The new regulations have caused closing delays throughout the industry, including at Realogy for both its company-owned and franchised operations.  The National Association of Realtors Economists  Outlook report published on October 12, 2016 reported that the additional time from contract-to-close for U.S. homesales reached the peak at 5.7 days in December 2015 and has eased to 3.4 days in September 2016.  
  RESPA has become a greater challenge in recent years for most industry participants offering settlement services, including mortgage companies, title companies and brokerages, because of changes in the regulatory environment.  With the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010, primary responsibility for enforcement of RESPA has shifted to the CFPB.  The CFPB has taken a much stricter approach toward interpretation of RESPA and related regulations than the prior regulatory authority (the Department of Housing and Urban Development) and has significantly increased the use of enforcement proceedings.  In the face of this changing regulatory landscape, various industry participants, while disagreeing with the CFPB s narrow interpretation of RESPA, have nevertheless decided to modify or terminate long-standing business arrangements to avoid the risk of protracted and costly litigation defending such arrangements.  While we have made, and may make, other changes to our RESPA-related business practices, we do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our operations. 
  Existing Homesales 
  According to NAR, existing homesale transactions for 2015 increased to   5.3 million   homes, or up   6%   compared to 2014, while homesale transactions increased   5%   on a combined basis for RFG and NRT.   
  For the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in 2015, NAR existing homesale transactions increased   6%  ,   4%   and   1%  , respectively.  For the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , RFG and NRT homesale transactions on a combined basis increased   4%  ,   3%   and   remained flat  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  Our homesale transactions were impacted by a slowing

of activity in the high-end markets served by NRT, the cumulative impact of market share attrition and inventory issues in the mid and lower priced homes in many of the markets served by NRT.  The annual and quarterly year-over-year trends in homesale transactions are as follows:

    In April 2015, NRT acquired Coldwell Banker United, a large franchisee of RFG, and as a result the drivers of Coldwell Banker United shifted from RFG to NRT.  In addition, NRT homesale sides include transactions from the acquisition of ZipRealty in August 2014.  The year-over-year change in homesale sides, excluding the impact of these acquisitions, would have been as follows: 

Since the acquisition of Coldwell Banker United occurred during the beginning of the second quarter of 2015, it did not impact the comparability of homesale transactions during the second and third quarters of 2016 compared to the second and third quarters of 2015. 
  As of their most recent releases, both NAR and Fannie Mae are forecasting an increase of   2%   in existing homesale transactions for   2017   compared to   2016  . 
  Existing Homesale Price 
  In 2015, NAR existing homesale average price increased   4%   compared to the same period in 2014, while average homesale price increased   3%   on a combined basis for RFG and NRT.   
  For the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in 2015, NAR existing homesale average price increased   4%  ,   3%   and   4%  , respectively.  For the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , RFG and NRT average homesale price on a combined basis increased   2%  ,   1%   and   2%  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  The combined average homesale price increase was due to a modest shift in homesale transaction activity from higher-price homes to lower and mid-priced homes across RFG and NRT.  Homes at the low to mid-price points are also experiencing continued constrained inventory levels.  The annual and quarterly year-over-year trends in the price of homes are as follows:

  We believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry are primarily driven by the affordability of housing, the economic health of the U.S. economy, positive demographic trends such as population growth, the increase in household formation, mortgage rate levels and mortgage availability, certain tax benefits, job growth, the inherent attributes of homeownership versus renting and the influence of local housing dynamics of supply versus demand.  At this time, these factors are generally trending favorably.  Factors that may negatively affect a sustained housing recovery include:  
             
    higher mortgage rates due to increases in long-term interest rates as well as reduced availability of mortgage financing; 
                
    insufficient inventory levels leading to lower unit sales;  
                
    changing attitudes towards home ownership, particularly among potential first-time homebuyers who may delay, or decide not to, purchase homes;  
                
    the impact of limited or negative equity of current homeowners, as well as the lack of available inventory may limit their proclivity to purchase an alternative home; 
                
    reduced affordability of homes; 
                
    high levels of unemployment and associated lack of consumer confidence;  
                
    unsustainable economic recovery in the U.S. or a weak recovery resulting in only modest economic growth; 
                
    a decline in home ownership levels in the U.S.;  
                
    geopolitical and economic instability; and 
                
    legislative or regulatory reform, including but not limited to reform that adversely impacts the financing of the U.S. housing market or amends the Internal Revenue Code in a manner that negatively impacts home ownership such as reform that reduces the amount that certain taxpayers would be allowed to deduct for home mortgage interest. 
     Many of the trends impacting our businesses that derive revenue from homesales also impact Cartus, which is a global provider of outsourced employee relocation services.  In addition to general residential housing trends, key drivers of Cartus are global corporate spending on relocation services, which has not returned to levels that existed prior to the most recent recession and changes in employment relocation trends.  Cartus is subject to a competitive pricing environment and lower average revenue per relocation as a result of a shift in the mix of services and number of services being delivered per move.  These factors have, and may continue to, put pressure on the growth and profitability of this segment.

While data provided by NAR and Fannie Mae are two indicators of the direction of the residential housing market, we believe that homesale statistics will continue to vary between us and NAR and Fannie Mae because: 
             
    they use survey data and estimates in their historical reports and forecasting models, which are subject to sampling error, whereas we use data based on actual reported results;  
                
    there are geographical differences and concentrations in the markets in which we operate versus the national market.  For example, many of our company owned brokerage offices are geographically located where average homesale prices are generally higher than the national average and therefore NAR survey data will not correlate with NRT's results;  
                
    comparability is also impaired due to NAR s utilization of seasonally adjusted annualized rates whereas we report actual period-over-period changes and their use of median price for their forecasts compared to our average price; 
                
    NAR historical data is subject to periodic review and revision and these revisions have been, and could be material in the future; and 
                
    NAR and Fannie Mae generally update their forecasts on a monthly basis and a subsequent forecast may change materially from a forecast that was previously issued.   
     While we believe that the industry data presented herein is derived from the most widely recognized sources for reporting U.S. residential housing market statistical data, we do not endorse or suggest reliance on this data alone.  We also note that forecasts are inherently uncertain or speculative in nature and actual results for any period could materially differ.  
   
  KEY DRIVERS OF OUR BUSINESSES  
  Within RFG and NRT, we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics:  (i) closed homesale sides, which represents either the "buy" side or the "sell" side of a homesale transaction, (ii) average homesale price, which represents the average selling price of closed homesale transactions, (iii) average homesale broker commission rate, which represents the average commission rate earned on either the "buy" side or "sell" side of a homesale transaction and (iv) net effective royalty rate which represents the average percentage of our franchisees  commission revenues payable to RFG, net of volume incentives achieved. 
  From 2007 through December 2013, the average homesale broker commission rate remained fairly stable; however, in 2014 and 2015 we experienced a modest decline in the average broker commission rate.  We expect that over the long term the average brokerage commission rates could modestly decline as a result of increases in average homesale prices and, to a lesser extent, competitors providing fewer services for a reduced fee.  This is particularly relevant in periods when there is constrained housing inventory.  A continuing housing recovery should result in an increase in our revenues, although such increases could be offset by modestly declining brokerage commission rates and competitive pressures. 
  In general, most of our third-party franchisees are entitled to volume incentives, which are calculated for each franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenues.  These incentives decrease during times of declining homesale transaction volumes and increase during market recoveries when there is a corresponding increase in homesale transaction volume.  As a result, the net effective royalty rate may be impacted by the cyclical residential housing market.  We expect that over the long term the net effective royalty rate will modestly decline as a result of increases in homesale transaction volume and, to a lesser extent, other market pressures.  In addition, several of our larger franchisees have a flat royalty rate, which will modestly reduce the Company's net effective royalty rate if their homesale transaction volume increases.  
  Royalty fees are charged to all franchisees pursuant to the terms of the relevant franchise agreements and are included in each of the real estate brands' franchise disclosure documents.  Non-standard incentives may be used as consideration for new or renewing franchisees.  Most of our franchisees do not receive these non-standard incentives and in contrast to royalties and volume incentives, they are not homesale transaction based.  We have accordingly excluded the non-standard incentives from the calculation of the net effective royalty rate.  Had these non-standard incentives been included, the net effective royalty rate would be lower by approximately   21   and   18   basis points for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  We expect that the trend of increasing non-standard incentives by 3 to 4 basis points a year will continue in the future in order to attract and retain certain large franchisees. 
  NRT has a significant concentration of real estate brokerage offices and transactions in geographic regions where home prices are at the higher end of the U.S. real estate market, particularly the east and west coasts, while RFG has franchised offices that are more widely dispersed across the United States.  Accordingly, operating results and homesale statistics may differ between NRT and RFG based upon geographic presence and the corresponding homesale activity in each geographic

region.  In addition, the share of commissions earned by sales associates directly impacts the margin earned by NRT.  Such share of commissions earned by sales associates varies by region and commission schedules are generally progressive to incentivize sales associates to achieve higher levels of production.  The level of commissions earned by sales associates is generally subject to review and resets on the anniversary of the sales associates' engagement with the broker.  We expect that they will continue to be subject to upward pressure because of the increased bargaining power of independent sales associates as well as more aggressive recruitment activities taken by our competitors. 
  As described above under "Current Industry Trends," competition for independent sales associates in our industry has intensified and we expect this competition will continue particularly with respect to more productive independent sales associates which has impacted NRT's market share and results of operations, as well as RFG to a lesser extent.  Currently, there are several different compensation models being utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales associates.  The most common models are as follows:  (1) a graduated commission plan, sometimes referred to as the "traditional model" where the independent sales associate receives a percentage of the brokerage commission that increases as the independent sales associate increases his or her volume of homesale transactions and the brokerage frequently provides independent sales associates with a broad set of support offerings and promotion of properties, (2) a desk rental or 100% plan, where the independent sales associate is entitled to all or nearly all of the broker commission and pays the broker on both a monthly and transaction basis for office space, tools, technology and support while also being responsible for the promotion of properties and other items, (3) a capped model, which generally blends aspects of the first two models described herein, and (4) a fixed transaction fee model where the sales associate is entitled to all of the broker commission and pays a fixed fee per homesale transaction and often receives very limited support from the brokerage.  Most brokerages focus primarily on one compensation model though some may offer one or more of these models to their sales associates.  Increasingly, independent sales associates have affiliated with brokerages that offer fewer services to the independent sales associates, allowing the independent sales associate to retain a greater percentage of the commission.  However, there are long-term trade-offs in the level of support independent sales associates receive in areas such as marketing, technology and professional education. 
  While NRT has historically compensated its independent sales associates using a traditional model, utilizing elements of other models depending upon the geographic market, we are placing an even greater focus on the quality of our services and our use of financial incentives to strengthen our recruiting and retention of independent sales associates and teams.  These actions include a more aggressive strategy to recruit top performing sales associates and retain top performing sales associates with the overall goal of sustaining or growing market share in various markets, improving NRT's overall profitability.  In addition, there will be an enhanced focus on the value proposition offered to independent sales associate teams.  Results of these recruiting efforts are not expected to be realized for at least 12 to 18 months as the benefits from recruiting new independent sales associates relate mainly to new listings, not pending listings. While we expect near-term moderate pressure on costs and margin from these initiatives, the expected increase in revenue should more than offset the related costs.   
  Within Cartus, we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics:  (i) initiations, which represent the total number of new transferees and the total number of real estate closings for affinity members and (ii) referrals, which represent the number of referrals from which we earn revenue from real estate brokers.   
  In TRG, operating performance is evaluated using the following key metrics:  (i) purchase title and closing units, which represent the number of title and closing units we process as a result of home purchases, (ii) refinance title and closing units, which represent the number of title and closing units we process as a result of homeowners refinancing their home loans, and (iii) average fee per closing unit, which represents the average fee we earn on purchase title and refinancing title sides.  An increase or decrease in homesale transactions will impact the financial results of TRG; however, the financial results are not significantly impacted by a change in homesale price.  In addition, although the average mortgage rate continued to decline in 2015 and 2016 and refinancing transactions increased as a result, we believe that an increase in mortgage rates in the future will most likely have a negative impact on refinancing title and closing units. 
  A decline in the number of homesale transactions and decline in homesale prices could adversely affect our results of operations by:  (i) reducing the royalties we receive from our franchisees, (ii) reducing the commissions our company owned brokerage operations earn, (iii) reducing the demand for our title and settlement services, and (iv) reducing the referral fees we earn in our relocation services business.  Our results could also be negatively affected by a decline in commission rates charged by brokers or greater commission payments to sales associates.

_______________ 

(1) 
    Total expenses   for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   includes   $9 million   of restructuring charges.  Total expenses   for the three months ended     September 30, 2015   includes a net benefit of   $14 million   of former parent legacy items.  
     Net revenues   decrease  d   $24 million   or   1%     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , principally due to the decrease in revenues at NRT. 
  Total expenses   decrease  d   $18 million   or   1%   primarily due to: 
             
    a   $33 million   net   decrease   in interest expense to   $37 million   in the third quarter of 2016 from   $70 million   in the third quarter of 2015.  Before the mark-to-market adjustments for our interest rate swaps, interest expense   decrease  d   $12 million   to   $42 million   in 2016 from   $54 million   in 2015 as a result of a reduction in total outstanding indebtedness and a lower weighted average interest rate.  Mark-to-market adjustments for our interest rate swaps resulted in gains of   $5 million   in the third quarter of 2016 compared to losses of   $16 million   in the same period of 2015; and    
                
    a   $21 million     decrease   in commission and other sales associate-related costs due to a decrease in homesale transaction volume at NRT; 
     partially offset by, 
             
    a   $12 million     increase   in operating and general and administrative expenses primarily driven by:  
                
    a   $6 million     increase   in variable operating costs at TRG primarily related to volume increases as a result of acquisitions; 
                
    $6 million   of additional employee-related costs associated with acquisitions completed after the third quarter of 2015; and 
                
    a   $2 million     increase   in employee-related costs primarily due to   $9 million   of salary, benefits and other increases, partially offset by a   $7 million   decrease in employee-related costs due to lower incentive accruals; 
                
    the absence in 2016 of a net benefit of former parent legacy items due to the reduction of a tax liability of   $14 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  ; and 
                
    $9 million   in restructuring charges for the Company's business optimization initiative. 
     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities   improved     $1 million   due to an increase in earnings from PHH Home Loans. 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company began a business optimization initiative that focuses on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the cost structure of each of the Company's business units.  The action is designed to improve client service levels across each of the business units while enhancing the Company's profitability and incremental margins.  The plan focuses on several key areas of opportunity which include process improvement efficiencies, office footprint optimization, leveraging technology and media spend, centralized procurement, outsourcing administrative services and organizational design.  The Company incurred   $9 million   of restructuring charges during the third quarter of 2016 which consisted of personnel-related costs and facility-related costs.  See Note 6, "Restructuring Costs", in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  The Company's provision for income taxes in interim periods is computed by applying its estimated annual effective tax rate against the income or loss before income taxes for the period.  In addition, non-recurring or discrete items are recorded during the period in which they occur.  The provision for income taxes was   $74 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $74 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our federal and state blended statutory rate is estimated to be 40% for 2016.  Our effective tax rate   for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   41%   and   40%  , respectively.

           (a) 
    Excludes transactions between segments, which consists of intercompany royalties and marketing fees paid by NRT to RFG of   $82 million   and   $84 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
              (b) 
    EBITDA for the combined RFG and NRT segments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   excludes   $7 million   of restructuring charges. 
     Corporate and Other EBITDA   for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   declined   $14 million   to negative   $20 million   primarily due to the absence in 2016 of a net benefit of former parent legacy items as a result of a reduction in a tax liability of   $14 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Real Estate Franchise Services (RFG) 
  Revenues   increase  d   $1 million   to   $215 million   and EBITDA   increase  d   $1 million   to   $153 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . 
  The   increase   in revenue was primarily driven by a   $5 million     increase   in third-party domestic franchisee royalty revenue due to a   3%     increase   in the average homesale price and a   1%     increase   in the number of homesale transactions partially offset by a   $2 million     decrease   in royalties received from NRT and   $1 million     decrease   in other revenue.   
  The intercompany royalty revenue received from NRT of   $79 million   and   $81 million   during the   third quarter   of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, are eliminated in consolidation.  See "Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services" for a discussion of the drivers related to intercompany royalties paid to RFG. 
  EBITDA   increase  d principally due to the   $1 million   increase in revenues discussed above. 
   
  Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services (NRT) 
  Revenues   decrease  d   $36 million   to   $1,231 million   and EBITDA declined   $22 million   to   $74 million     for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . 
  The   decrease   of   $36 million   was comprised of a   $66 million     decrease   in revenue primarily due to lower commission income earned on homesale transactions by our existing brokerage operations, partially offset by a   $30 million   increase in revenue primarily due to commission income earned from acquisitions completed after the third quarter of 2015.  The revenue   decrease   was driven by a   4%     decrease   in the number of homesale transactions and a   2   basis point   decrease   in the average broker commission rate, offset by a   1%     increase   in the average price of homes.  Homesale transactions and average broker commission rate decreased due to a slowing of activity in the high-end markets served by NRT, the cumulative impact of market share attrition, and inventory issues in the mid and lower priced homes in many of the markets served by NRT. 
  EBITDA   decrease  d   $22 million   primarily due to: 
             
    the   $36 million     decrease   in revenues discussed above;  
                
    $6 million   in restructuring costs related to the Company's business optimization plan; 
                
    a   $6 million     increase   in employee-related costs related to acquisitions; and 
                
    a   $1 million     increase   in marketing expenses driven by higher advertising spending. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    a   $21 million     decrease   in commission expenses paid to independent real estate sales associates from   $855 million   in the   third quarter   of 2015 to   $834 million   in the   third quarter   of 2016, as a result of the   decrease   in revenues discussed above.  The decrease in commission expense is net of a   $17 million     increase   attributable to acquisitions; 
                 
    a   $1 million     increase   in equity earnings related to our investment in PHH Home Loans.

Underwriter revenues   increase  d   $7 million   due to the volume increases discussed above. 
  EBITDA   increase  d   $3 million   as a result of the   $17 million     increase   in revenues discussed above, partially offset by an   increase   of   $4 million   in employee-related costs, a   $6 million   increase in variable operating costs and   $2 million     increase   in marketing expenses.

(1) 
    Total expenses   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes   $30 million   restructuring charges and a net cost of   $1 million   of former parent legacy items.  Total expenses   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2015   includes a net benefit of   $15 million   of former parent legacy items.  
     Net revenues   increase  d   $59 million   or   1%     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , principally due to an increase in revenues at RFG and TRG. 
  Total expenses   increase  d   $77 million   or   2%   primarily due to: 
             
    a   $48 million     increase   in operating and general and administrative expenses driven by:  
                
    $30 million   of additional employee-related costs associated with acquisitions; 
                
    a   $24 million     increase   in variable operating costs at TRG primarily related to volume increases as a result of acquisitions; and 
                
    a   $4 million     increase   in employee-related costs primarily due to   $20 million   salary, benefits and other increases, partially offset by a   $16 million   decrease in employee-related costs due to lower incentive accruals, 
     partially offset by 
             
    the absence in 2016 of   $6 million   of certain transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Coldwell Banker United and the settlement of a legal matter in 2015.

$30 million   in restructuring charges related to the Company's business optimization initiative; 
                
    the absence in 2016 of a net benefit of former parent legacy items as a result of the reduction of a tax liability of   $15 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2015; and 
                
    a   $10 million     increase   in marketing expenses due to higher advertising costs at NRT and TRG primarily due to acquisitions; 
     partially offset by; 
             
    a   $19 million     decrease   in interest expense   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Before the mark-to-market adjustments for our interest rate swaps, interest expense decreased   $32 million   to   $129 million   in 2016 from   $161 million   in 2015 as a result of a reduction in total outstanding indebtedness and a lower weighted average interest rate.  Mark-to-market adjustments for our interest rate swaps resulted in losses of   $40 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to losses of   $27 million   in the same period of 2015.   
     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities declined   $3 million   primarily due to a   $4 million     decrease   in earnings from PHH Home Loans. 
  The Company incurred   $30 million   of restructuring charges associated with the business optimization initiative during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   which consisted of personnel-related costs, facility-related costs and other restructuring-related costs.  See Note 6, "Restructuring Costs", in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  The Company's provision for income taxes in interim periods is computed by applying its estimated annual effective tax rate against the income or loss before income taxes for the period.  In addition, non-recurring or discrete items are recorded during the period in which they occur.  The provision for income taxes was   $114 million     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $116 million     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Our federal and state blended statutory rate is estimated to be 40% for 2016.  Our effective tax rate   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   42%   and was impacted by a discrete item related to equity awards for which the market value at vesting was lower than at the date of grant.  Our effective tax rate   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   39%  .

Excluding restructuring charges during the first nine months of 2016 related to the Company's business optimization plan, the "Total Company" EBITDA margin would have remained flat at   14%  .  On a segment basis, RFG's margin   remained flat   at   66%  ; however, it increased   1   percentage point to   67%   excluding restructuring charges during the first nine months of 2016.

The Title and Settlement Services segment margin   increase  d   2   percentage points to   12%   from   10%   primarily due to the positive margin impact of volume increases due to acquisitions and the average fee per closing unit compared to the first nine months of 2015.

well as a   $7 million   increase in other revenue primarily related to marketing-related activities and the timing of brand conferences and franchisee events.  These   increase  s were partially offset by a   $4 million     decrease   in non-standard incentives amortization, a   $3 million     decrease   of brand marketing revenue and   $1 million     decrease   in royalties received from NRT. 
  The intercompany royalty revenue received from NRT of   $217 million   and   $218 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, are eliminated in consolidation.  See "Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services" for a discussion of the drivers related to intercompany royalties paid to RFG. 
  The   $10 million     increase   in EBITDA was principally due to the   $15 million     increase   in revenues discussed above, partially offset by   $4 million   in restructuring costs related to the Company's business optimization plan and a   $3 million     increase   in expenses related to the timing of brand conferences and franchisee events. 
   
  Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services (NRT) 
  Revenues   decrease  d   $12 million   to   $3,340 million   and EBITDA declined   $46 million   to   $131 million     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in   2015  . 
  The   decrease   of   $12 million   was comprised of a   $91 million     decrease   in revenue primarily due to lower commission income earned on homesale transactions by our existing brokerage operations, partially offset by a   $79 million     increase   in revenue primarily due to commission income earned from acquisitions completed after the third quarter of 2015.  The revenue   decrease   was driven by a   1%     decrease   in the average price of homes, partially offset by a   1   basis point   increase   in the average broker commission rate.  Revenues were negatively impacted by slowing of activity in the high-end markets served by NRT, the cumulative impact of market share attrition, and inventory issues in the mid and lower priced homes in many of the markets served by NRT. 
  EBITDA   decrease  d   $46 million   primarily due to: 
             
    the   $12 million     decrease   in revenues discussed above;  
                
    $15 million   in restructuring costs related to the Company's business optimization plan;

    a   $4 million     increase   in marketing expenses primarily related to acquisitions. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    a   $6 million     decrease   in commission expenses paid to independent real estate sales associates from   $2,262 million   in the first nine months of 2015 to   $2,256 million   in the first nine months of 2016, as a result of the   decrease   in revenues discussed above.

  Revenues   decrease  d   $9 million   as a result of a   $14 million     decrease   in non-affinity referral revenue due to lower broker-to-broker volume, the absence of a large group move which occurred in 2015 and lower relocation referral volume and a   $1 million     decrease   in other revenue, partially offset by a   $5 million     increase   in affinity referrals and a   $2 million     increase   in at-risk revenue due to higher volume. 
  EBITDA   decrease  d   $9 million   as a result of the   $9 million     decrease   in revenues discussed above,   $4 million   in restructuring costs related to the Company's business optimization plan and a   $3 million   increase in other operating expenses primarily related to higher at-risk volume.

  Total liabilities   decreased     $122 million   due to a   $232 million     decrease   in corporate debt as a result of refinancing transactions and debt redemptions completed during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and a   $17 million     decrease   in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to lower employee-related accruals, partially offset by higher accrued interest and commissions.  These decreases were partially offset by a   $98 million     increase   in deferred tax liabilities, an   $18 million     increase   in other non-current liabilities due to interest rate swaps and an   $8 million     increase   in securitization obligations due to seasonal increases at Cartus.  
  Total equity   increase  d   $46 million   primarily due to net income of   $156 million     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , partially offset by a   $112 million   decrease in additional paid in capital primarily related to the Company's repurchase of   $134 million   of common stock and   $13 million   of dividend payments, partially offset by stock-based compensation activity of   $33 million  . 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary liquidity needs have been to service our debt and finance our working capital and capital expenditures, which we have historically satisfied with cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facilities and securitization facilities.  Given the significant reduction in our indebtedness and annual interest expense that resulted from our October 2012 initial public offering and related transactions, as well as our indebtedness repayments and refinancings, we generated positive cash flows from operations in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  After giving effect to the debt refinancing transactions completed from 2013 through the first nine months of 2016, our outstanding indebtedness, excluding securitizations, has been reduced by approximately   $855 million   since the beginning of 2013.  In July 2016, the Company refinanced its existing $1,858 million Term Loan B due July 2020.  The new Term Loan B was issued at par in the amount of $1,100 million with a maturity date in July 2022.  Concurrently, the Company borrowed a new tranche of term loans under its Term Loan A Facility ("Term Loan A-1") in the amount of $355 million with a maturity date in July 2021 and terms substantially similar to its existing Term Loan A.  The Company used the net proceeds from the Term Loan B and Term Loan A-1, along with revolver borrowings and cash on hand, to pay off the existing Term Loan B of $1,858 million.  Based upon our current debt projections for 2016, we expect our cash interest run rate to be reduced to approximately   $170 million  .

We intend to use future cash flow primarily to acquire stock under our share repurchase program, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and reduce indebtedness.  In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $275 million  .  Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time through open market transactions, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions.  The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors.  From the date of authorization through   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased and retired   4.5 million   shares of common stock for   $134 million   at a weighted average price of   $29.49   per share.   
  We may also from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding notes, through tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
  On August 3, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy on its common stock and declared a cash dividend of   $0.09   per share of the Company s common stock which was paid on August 31, 2016, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 17, 2016.  The declaration and payment of any future dividend will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions, including restrictive covenants contained in the Company s credit agreement, and the indenture governing the Company s outstanding debt securities, capital requirements and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. 
  We are currently experiencing a recovery in the residential real estate market, however, if the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve or worsens, our business, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected, including our ability to access capital and grow our business. 
  Historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year.  A significant portion of the expenses we incur in our real estate brokerage operations are related to marketing activities and commissions and therefore, are variable.  However, many of our other expenses, such as interest payments, facilities costs and certain personnel-related costs, are fixed and cannot be reduced during a seasonal slowdown.  Consequently, our debt balances are generally at their highest levels at or around the end of the first quarter of every year. 
  Our liquidity position has significantly improved but continues to be impacted by our remaining interest expense and would be adversely impacted by:  (i) a halt in the recovery of the residential real estate market, (ii) a significant increase in LIBOR or ABR, or (iii) our inability to access our relocation securitization programs. 
  We will continue to evaluate potential refinancing and financing transactions.  There can be no assurance as to which, if any, of these alternatives we may pursue as the choice of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions, our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our existing financing agreements and the consents we may need to obtain under the relevant documents.  There can be no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
  Cash Flows 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $224 million   of cash and cash equivalents, a   decrease   of   $191 million   compared to the balance of   $415 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The following table summarizes our cash flows   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $11 million   more cash was provided by operating activities compared to the same period in   2015  .  The change was principally due to   $67 million   more cash provided by a net decrease in relocation and trade receivables,   $8 million   of additional cash provided by operating results and   $4 million   more cash

provided due to a decrease in other assets.  These increases were partially offset by   $57 million   more cash used for accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and   $9 million   more cash used for other operating activities.  
  For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we used   $8 million   less cash for investing activities compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to   $16 million   less cash used for acquisition related payments, partially offset by   $4 million   more cash used for other investing activities. 
  For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $438 million   of cash was used for financing activities compared to   $27 million   of cash provided during the same period in   2015  .    For the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   $438 million   of cash was used for: 
             
    the repayment of   $758 million   to reduce the Term Loan B facility; 
                 
    the net repayment of   $45 million   of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility; 
                
    $134 million   for the purchase of our common stock; 
                
    $31 million   of amortization payments on the term loan facilities; 
                
    $23 million   for payments of contingent consideration; and 
                
    $28 million   of other financing payments partially related to capital leases and interest rate swaps;  
                
    $15 million   of debt issuance costs; 
                
    $13 million   of dividend payments; and 
                
    $6 million   of tax payments related to net share settlement for stock-based compensation; 
     partially offset by, 
              
    $355 million   of proceeds from issuance of the Term Loan A-1 facility; and 
                
    a   $9 million   net increase in securitization borrowings. 
     For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   $27 million   of cash was provided by financing activities as a result of   $67 million   of net securitization borrowings, partially offset by   $14 million   of amortization payments on the term loan facility,   $18 million   of other financing related payments,   $5 million   of tax payments related to stock-based compensation and   $5 million   for contingent consideration payments.

    The debt issuance costs related to our Revolving Credit Facility and securitization obligations are classified as a deferred financing asset within other assets. 

(1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $815 million   of borrowing capacity under its Revolving Credit Facility leaving   $660 million   of available capacity.  The revolving credit facility expires in October 2020, but is classified on the balance sheet as current due to the revolving nature of the facility.  On   November 2, 2016  , the Company had   $115 million   outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving   $700 million   of available capacity. 
              (2) 
    Interest rates with respect to revolving loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   are based on, at the Company's option, (a) adjusted   LIBOR   plus an additional margin or (b)   ABR   plus an additional margin, in each case subject to adjustment based on the then current senior secured leverage ratio.  Based on the previous quarter senior secured leverage ratio, the   LIBOR   margin was   2.00%   and the   ABR   margin was   1.00%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (3) 
    The Term Loan B provides for quarterly amortization payments totaling   1%   per annum of the original principal amount.  The interest rate with respect to term loans under the Term Loan B is based on, at the Company s option, (a) adjusted   LIBOR   plus   3.00%   (with a   LIBOR   floor of   0.75%  ) or (b) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. s prime rate ("  ABR  ") plus   2.00%   (with an   ABR   floor of   1.75%  ).  
              (4) 
    The Term Loan A provides for quarterly amortization payments, which commenced March 31, 2016, totaling per annum   5%  ,   5%  ,   7.5%  ,   10.0%   and   12.5%   of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.  The interest rates with respect to term loans under the Term Loan A are based on, at the Company's option, (a) adjusted   LIBOR   plus an additional margin or (b)   ABR   plus an additional margin, in each case subject to adjustment based on the then current senior secured leverage ratio.  Based on the previous quarter senior secured leverage ratio, the   LIBOR   margin was   2.00%   and the   ABR   margin was   1.00%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (5) 
    The Term Loan A-1 provides for quarterly amortization payments, which commenced on September 30, 2016, totaling per annum   2.5%  ,   2.5%  ,   5%  ,   7.5%   and   10.0%   of the original principal amount of the Term Loan A-1, with the last amortization payment made on June 30, 2021.  The interest rates with respect to term loans under the Term Loan A-1 are based on, at the Company's option, (a) adjusted   LIBOR   plus an additional margin or (b)   ABR   plus an additional margin, in each case subject to adjustment based on the then current senior secured leverage ratio.  Based on the previous quarter senior secured leverage ratio, the   LIBOR   margin was   2.00%   and the   ABR   margin was   1.00%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (6) 
    Available capacity is subject to maintaining sufficient relocation related assets to collateralize these securitization obligations. 
              (7) 
    In June 2016, Realogy Group extended the existing Apple Ridge Funding LLC securitization program utilized by Cartus until June 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $325 million   of borrowing capacity under the Apple Ridge Funding LLC securitization program leaving   $85 million   of available capacity. 
              (8) 
    Consists of a    10 million   revolving loan facility and a    5 million   working capital facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $19 million   of borrowing capacity under the Cartus Financing Limited securitization program leaving   $4 million   of available capacity.  In October 2016, Realogy Group extended the existing Cartus Financing Limited securitization program to August 2017. 
              (9) 
    Not included in this table, the Company had   $128 million   of outstanding letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility with a weighted average rate of   3.10%  .  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company moved outstanding letters of credit to the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility and terminated the synthetic letter of credit facility.  As a result, the Company increased the capacity under the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility by   $47 million   to   $135 million  . 
     See Note 5, "Short and Long-Term Debt", in the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's indebtedness. 
   
  Covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility and Indentures 
  The Senior Secured Credit Facility, Term Loan A Facility, the Unsecured Letter of Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Unsecured Notes contain various covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) Realogy Group s ability to, among other things: 
             
    incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; 
                
    pay dividends or make distributions to Realogy Group s stockholders, including Realogy Holdings; 
                
    repurchase or redeem capital stock; 
                
    make loans, investments or acquisitions; 
                
    incur restrictions on the ability of certain of Realogy Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to Realogy Group; 
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates; 
                
    create liens; 

49 

     Table of Contents  

merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of Realogy Group's and its material subsidiaries' assets; 
                
    transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and 
                
    prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated indebtedness. 
     As a result of the covenants to which we remain subject, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.  In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility require us to maintain a senior secured leverage ratio. 
  The senior secured leverage ratio, not to exceed   4.75   to   1.00  , is tested quarterly.  In this report, the Company refers to the term "Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA" to mean EBITDA as so defined for purposes of determining compliance with the senior secured leverage covenant.  The senior secured leverage ratio measured at any applicable quarter end is Realogy Group's total senior secured net debt divided by the trailing twelve month Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA.  Total senior secured net debt does not include unsecured indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes, as well as the securitization obligations. 
  See Note 5, "Short and Long-Term Debt Senior Secured Credit Facility" and "Short and Long-Term Debt Term Loan A Facility" in the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of "non-GAAP financial measures," such as EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA and the ratios related thereto.  These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP.  
  EBITDA is defined by us as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net (other than relocation services interest for securitization assets and securitization obligations) and income taxes and is our primary non-GAAP measure.    
  Operating EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA before restructuring, early extinguishment of debt and legacy items and is used as a supplementary financial measure.  Operating EBITDA calculated for a twelve-month period is presented because the Company believes these items do not directly affect the operating results of the Company and accordingly should be excluded in comparing operating results.  Operating EBITDA does not include pro-forma adjustments for business optimization initiatives and acquisitions or non-cash adjustments such as stock-based compensation expense, used to calculate Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Term Loan A Facility senior secured leverage ratio.      
  Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA calculated for a twelve-month period is presented to demonstrate our compliance with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Term Loan A Facility.  Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA calculated for a twelve-month period corresponds to the definition of "EBITDA," calculated on a "pro forma basis," used in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Term Loan A Facility to calculate the senior secured leverage ratio.  Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA includes adjustments to EBITDA for restructuring costs, former parent legacy cost (benefit) items, net, loss on the early extinguishment of debt, non-cash charges and incremental securitization interest costs, as well as pro forma cost savings for restructuring initiatives, the pro forma effect of business optimization initiatives and the pro forma effect of acquisitions and new franchisees, in each case calculated as of the beginning of the twelve-month period. 
  We present EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA because we believe EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provide greater transparency into our results of operations.  Our management, including our chief operating decision maker, uses EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of our business.  EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP.     
  We believe EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net interest expense), taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the amortization of intangibles, which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance.  We further believe that EBITDA is frequently used by securities

     Table of Contents  

analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an EBITDA measure when reporting their results.     
  EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider EBITDA, Operating EBITDA or Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are:     
             
    these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash required for, our working capital needs;  
                
    these measures do not reflect our interest expense (except for interest related to our securitization obligations), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;  
                
    these measures do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;  
                
    these measures do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  
                
    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and  
                
    other companies may calculate these measures differently so they may not be comparable.  
     In addition to the limitations described above, Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA includes pro forma cost savings, the pro forma effect of business optimization initiatives and the pro forma full period effect of acquisitions and new franchisees.  These adjustments may not reflect the actual cost savings or pro forma effect recognized in future periods.       
  A reconciliation of net income attributable to Realogy Group to EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and Adjusted (Covenant) EBITDA for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   are set forth in the following table:

Franchisee sales activity is comprised of new franchise agreements as well as growth through acquisitions and independent sales associate recruitment by existing franchisees with our assistance.  We have made a number of assumptions in calculating such estimates and there can be no assurance that we would have generated the projected levels of EBITDA had we owned the acquired entities or entered into the franchise contracts as of   October 1, 2015  .

Pursuant to the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Term Loan A Facility, total senior secured net debt does not include our securitization obligations or unsecured indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes. 
     Set forth in the table below is a reconciliation of net income attributable to Realogy to EBITDA and Operating EBITDA for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Contractual Obligations 
  See "Financial Obligations" for a description of the Company's recent debt transactions.  All other future contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   have not changed materially from the amounts reported in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
  In presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein.  Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events.  However, events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions.  If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our combined results of operations, financial position and liquidity.  We believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time.  
  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which includes a description of our critical accounting policies that involve subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks. 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our senior secured debt.  At   September 30, 2016  , our primary interest rate exposure was to interest rate fluctuations, specifically   LIBOR  , due to its impact on our variable rate borrowings of our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and the Term Loan A Facility.  Given that our borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and Term Loan A Facility are generally based upon   LIBOR  , this rate will be the Company's primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future.  We do not have significant exposure to foreign currency risk nor do we expect to have significant exposure to foreign currency risk in the foreseeable future. 
  We assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis.  The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change (increase and decrease) in interest rates.  We exclude the fair values of relocation receivables and advances and securitization borrowings from our sensitivity analysis because we believe the interest rate risk on these assets and liabilities is mitigated as the rate we earn on relocation receivables and advances and the rate we incur on our securitization borrowings are based on similar variable indices. 
   At   September 30, 2016  , we had variable interest rate long-term debt from our outstanding term loans of   $2,024 million  , which excludes   $255 million   of securitization obligations.  The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding term loans at   September 30, 2016   was   3.19%  .  The interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B is based on adjusted   LIBOR   plus   3.00%   (with a   LIBOR   floor of   0.75%  ).  The interest rate with respect to term loans under the Term Loan A Facility is based on adjusted   LIBOR   plus an additional margin subject to adjustment based on the current senior secured leverage ratio.  Based on the   September 30, 2016   senior secured leverage ratio, the   LIBOR   margin was   2.00%  .  At   September 30, 2016   the one-month   LIBOR   rate was   0.53%  ; therefore, we have estimated that a 0.25% increase in   LIBOR   would have a   $2 million   impact on our annual interest expense. 
  We have entered into interest rate swaps with a notional value of   $1,475 million   to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with our variable rate borrowings.  Our interest rate swaps are as follows: 

The swaps help protect our outstanding variable rate borrowings from future interest rate volatility.  The fixed interest rates on the swaps range from   2.07%   to   2.89%  .  The Company had a liability for the fair value of the interest rate swaps of  $71 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of these interest rate swaps is subject to movements in   LIBOR   and will fluctuate in future periods.  We have estimated that a 0.25% increase in the   LIBOR   yield curve would increase the fair value of our interest rate swaps by   $12 million   and would decrease interest expense.  While these results may be used as a benchmark, they should not be viewed as a forecast of future results. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
  Controls and Procedures for Realogy Holdings Corp. 
           (a)

     Other Financial Information 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.  Their reports, dated   November 4, 2016  , are included on pages 4 and 5.  The reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP state that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that unaudited financial information.  Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") for their report on the unaudited financial information because that report is not a "report" or a "part" of the registration statement prepared or certified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Act.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. 
  Legal Real Estate Business 
  Strader, et al. and Hall v. PHH Corporation, et al.   (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California).  This is a purported class action brought by four California residents against 15 defendants, including Realogy and certain of its subsidiaries, PHH Corporation and PHH Home Loans, LLC (a joint venture between Realogy and PHH), alleging violations of Section 8(a) of RESPA.  Plaintiffs seek to represent two subclasses comprised of all persons in the United States who, since January 31, 2005, (1) obtained a RESPA-covered mortgage loan from either (a) PHH Home Loans, LLC or one of its subsidiaries, or (b) one of the mortgage services managed by PHH Corporation for other lenders, and (2) paid a fee for title insurance or settlement services to TRG or one of its subsidiaries.  Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that PHH Home Loans, LLC operates in violation of RESPA and that the other defendants violate RESPA by referring business to one another under agreements or arrangements.  Plaintiffs seek treble damages and an award of attorneys  fees, costs and disbursements.  On February 5, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case claiming that not only do the claims lack merit, but they are time-barred under RESPA's one-year statute of limitations.  On April 5, 2016, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss with leave for the plaintiffs to amend their complaint.  Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on April 21, 2016, and a third amended complaint on May 12, 2016.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint.  The Court denied the motion on October 6, 2016, without prejudice to defendants  ability to move for summary judgment after discovery.  The parties are proceeding with discovery. 
  The case raises significant claims and rests in part on certain interpretations of RESPA by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which are the subject of pending industry litigation in various jurisdictions.  As with all class action litigation, the case is inherently complex and subject to many uncertainties.  We believe that we and the joint venture have complied with RESPA, the regulations promulgated thereunder and existing regulatory guidance.  There can be no assurance, however, that if the action continues and a large class is subsequently certified, the plaintiffs will not seek a substantial damage award, penalties and other remedies.  Given the early stage of this case and the novel claims and issues presented, we cannot estimate a range of reasonably potential losses for this litigation.  The Company will vigorously defend this action.    
  The Company is involved in certain other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business.  Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, franchising arrangements, actions against our title company alleging it knew or should have known that others were committing mortgage fraud, brokerage disputes like the failure to disclose hidden defects in the property such as mold, other brokerage claims associated with listing information and property history, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including franchisees and independent sales associates, antitrust and anti-competition claims, general fraud claims, employment law claims, including claims challenging the classification of our sales associates as independent contractors, wage and hour classification claims, and claims alleging violations of RESPA or state consumer fraud statutes.  While the results of such claims and legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe based on information currently available to us that the final outcome of current proceedings against the Company will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   
  Legal Cendant Corporate Litigation  
  Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of July 27, 2006 among Cendant, Realogy Group, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport, each of Realogy Group, Wyndham Worldwide and Travelport have assumed certain contingent and other corporate liabilities (and related costs and expenses), which are primarily related to each of their respective businesses.  In addition, Realogy Group has assumed   62.5%   and Wyndham Worldwide has assumed   37.5%   of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities (and related costs and expenses) of Cendant or its subsidiaries, which are not primarily related to any of the respective businesses of Realogy Group, Wyndham Worldwide, Travelport and/or Cendant s vehicle rental operations, in each case incurred or allegedly incurred on or prior to the date of the separation of Travelport from Cendant.  
  * * * 
  The Company believes that it has adequately accrued for legal matters as appropriate.  The Company records litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable.  

55 

     Table of Contents  

Litigation and other disputes are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and unfavorable resolutions could occur.  In addition, class action lawsuits or regulatory proceedings challenging practices that have broad impact can be costly to defend and, depending on the class size and claims, could be costly to settle.  As such, the Company could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims with liability that are materially in excess of amounts accrued and these settlements could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. 
  Litigation and claims against other participants in the residential real estate industry may impact the Company when the rulings in those cases cover practices common to the broader industry.  Examples may include claims associated with RESPA compliance, broker fiduciary duties, and sales agent classification.  One such case is PHH Corp. vs. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, No. 15-1177.  On October 11, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision in that case addressing various important RESPA issues, including that:  (1) Section 8(c)(2) of RESPA (which permits  bona fide  payments for goods and services actually performed), remains a viable exception under RESPA and does not constitute a payment for a referral in violation of RESPA where the amount paid does not exceed the reasonable market value of the goods or services; (2) new CFPB interpretations of RESPA cannot be enforced on a retroactive basis where there is reliance on prior regulatory interpretations; and (3) the CFPB is bound by the three-year statute of limitations for government enforcement of RESPA. The CFPB may appeal the decision to the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and any decision there could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
  The Company also may be impacted by litigation and other claims against companies in other industries.  Rulings on matters such as the enforcement of arbitration agreements and worker classification may adversely affect the Company and other residential real estate industry participants as a result of the classification of sales associates as independent contractors, irrespective of the fact that the parties subject to the rulings are in a different industry.  There is active worker classification litigation in numerous jurisdictions, including Massachusetts, California, New Jersey and New York, against a variety of industries where the plaintiffs seek to reclassify independent contractors as employees or to challenge the use of federal and state minimum wage and overtime exemptions.  To the extent the defendants are unsuccessful in these types of litigation matters, and we or our franchisees cannot distinguish our or their practices (or our industry s practices), we and our franchisees could face significant liability and could be required to modify certain business relationships, either of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.  There also are changing employment-related regulatory interpretations at both the federal and state levels that could create risks around historic practices and that could require changes in business practices, both for us and our franchisees. 
   
  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
           (c) 
    In February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $275 million   of the Company s common stock.  Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time through open market transactions, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions.  The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors.  The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  All of the repurchased common stock has been retired. 
     The following table sets forth information relating to repurchase of shares of our common stock during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Item 5.    Other Information. 
  On November 2, 2016, Marc E. Becker notified the Company that he is resigning from the Board of Directors of Realogy Holdings Corp. ( Realogy ) and the Board of Managers of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Realogy Intermediate Holdings LLC and Realogy Group LLC (Realogy together with its subsidiaries, collectively, the  Company ).  Giving effect to that resignation, the Realogy Board of Directors has nine directors, eight of whom are independent.

     Table of Contents  

Mr. Becker, a partner of Apollo Management LP, served as a member of the Board of Directors of Realogy for nearly 10 years, which commenced upon Apollo s acquisition of the Company in April 2007 and continued through the sale of Apollo's equity interest in the Company in 2013.  To provide continuity to the Board following the Apollo sale, Mr. Becker agreed to continue to serve on the Board while it appointed four new independent directors, three of whom joined the Board this year.  With that transition having been made, Mr. Becker tendered his resignation, effective immediately.  His resignation was not related to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company s operations, policies or practices.

    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s Board of Directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
