  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note 1: Basis of Presentation  

Exponent, Inc. (referred
to as the  Company  or  Exponent ) is an engineering and scientific consulting firm that provides solutions
to complex problems. The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to the last day of December. 

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X promulgated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not contain all the information and notes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments which are necessary for the fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements have been included
and all such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The operating results for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily representative of the results of future quarterly or annual periods. The following information should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2016, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
on February 26, 2016. 

The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Exponent, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which are all wholly owned. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Dividend.  The Company
declared and paid cash dividends per common share during the periods presented as follows: 

On October 19, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors announced a cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the Company s common stock, payable December
23, 2016, to stockholders of record as of December 2, 2016. The Company expects to continue paying quarterly dividends in the future,
subject to declaration by the Company s Board of Directors. 

Use of Estimates.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include accounting for
revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncement.  On March 30, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard
Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which amends Accounting
Standard Codification Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation . ASU No. 2016-09 includes provisions intended to
simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Under
ASU No. 2016-09, entities will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as an income tax benefit or expense in the income
statement. Prior to ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in-capital on the balance sheet. Under
ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Prior to ASU No.
2016-09, excess tax benefits were classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. Under ASU No. 2016-09, entities
will also elect an accounting policy to either estimate the number of forfeitures of share-based awards or account for forfeitures
when they occur. Prior to ASU No. 2016-09, entities were required to estimate forfeitures. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 allows
entities to withhold from employees upon exercise or settlement of share-based awards up to the maximum individual statutory tax
rate without classifying the awards as a liability. 

ASU No. 2016-09 is effective
for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting
period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. The Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2016-09 as of the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal
2016. 

During the third quarter
of fiscal 2016 the Company recorded an excess tax benefit of $39,000 as an income tax benefit in the condensed consolidated statement
of income and classified this excess tax benefit as an operating activity in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.
Excluding the excess tax benefit, net income would have been $11,250,000 and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.41 per
share during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an excess
tax benefit of $4,827,000 as an income tax benefit in the condensed consolidated statement of income and classified this excess
tax benefit as an operating activity in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Excluding the excess tax benefit, net
income would have been $32,265,000 and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.18 per share during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies was applied prospectively and thus prior periods were
not adjusted. The formula for calculating diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method no longer includes the estimated
excess tax benefits that were recorded in additional paid-in capital. The impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 had an immaterial
impact on weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

In connection with the
early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, the Company elected to account for forfeitures of share-based awards when they occur. This election
is applied prospectively and thus prior periods were not adjusted. An adjustment of $78,000 was made during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 to reduce beginning retained earnings for estimated forfeitures previously recorded on outstanding share-based
awards. The election to account for forfeitures of share-based awards when they occur did not have a material impact on stock-based
compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Not Yet Effective . On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires
an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred by one year the
effective date for the new revenue recognition standard for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP. In accordance with the deferral,
the new standard will be effective for the Company on the first day of fiscal 2018 (December 30, 2017). Early application is permitted
beginning fiscal 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company
is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company
has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 

On February 25, 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases , which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet. 
The new standard will be effective for the Company on the first day of fiscal 2019 (December 29, 2018).  Early adoption
is permitted.  The standard requires use of the modified retrospective transition method, with elective relief, which
requires application of the guidance for all periods presented.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No.
2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  The Company has not yet selected a
transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. The standard will
require the Company to record a right of use asset and a lease liability that will materially gross up its balance sheet.

Note 2: Fair Value Measurements  

The Company measures
certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including available-for-sale fixed income
securities, trading fixed income and equity securities held in its deferred compensation plan and the liability associated
with its deferred compensation plan. There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015. Any transfers between fair value measurement levels would be recorded on
the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. The fair value of these certain financial
assets and liabilities was determined using the following inputs at September 30, 2016: 

(1)   Included in cash and cash equivalents on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet.   

(2)   Included in short-term investments on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet.   

(3)   Included in prepaid expenses and other assets and deferred compensation plan assets on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.   

(4)   Included in accrued payroll and employee benefits and deferred compensation on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.   

The fair value of these certain
financial assets and liabilities was determined using the following inputs at January 1, 2016: 

(1)   Included in cash and cash equivalents on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet.   

(2)   Included in short-term investments on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet.   

(3)   Included in prepaid expenses and other assets and deferred compensation plan assets on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.   

(4)   Included in accrued payroll and employee benefits and deferred compensation on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.   

Fixed income available-for-sale
securities as of September 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016 represent obligations of United States agencies and state and local government
agencies. Fixed income and equity trading securities represent mutual funds held in the Company s deferred compensation plan.
See Note 6 for additional information about the Company s deferred compensation plan. 

Cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016: 

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments consisted of the following as of January 1, 2016: 

The following table summarizes the cost and
estimated fair value of short-term fixed income securities classified as short-term investments based on stated effective maturities
as of September 30, 2016: 

At September 30, 2016 and
January 1, 2016, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities valued using significant unobservable inputs. 

The following financial
instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016,
but require disclosure of their fair values: accounts receivable, other assets and accounts payable. The estimated fair value of
such instruments at September 30, 2016 and January 1, 2016 approximates their carrying value as reported on the consolidated balance
sheet. 

There were no other-than-temporary
impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and October 2, 2015. 

Note 3: Net Income Per Share  

Basic per share amounts
are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted per share amounts are calculated
using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, when dilutive, the weighted-average number
of potential common shares from the issuance of common stock to satisfy outstanding restricted stock units and the exercise of
outstanding options to purchase common stock using the treasury stock method. 

The following schedule reconciles the shares
used to calculate basic and diluted net income per share: 

There were no options excluded
from the diluted per share calculations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Common stock options to purchase
40,000 shares were excluded from the diluted per share calculation for the three months ended October 2, 2015 due to their antidilutive
effect. The weighted-average exercise price for the antidilutive shares was $44.20 for the three months ended October 2, 2015.
Common stock options to purchase 33,993 shares were excluded from the diluted per share calculation for the nine months ended October
2, 2015 due to their antidilutive effect. The weighted-average exercise price for the antidilutive shares was $44.20 for the nine
months ended October 2, 2015. 

Note 4: Stock-Based Compensation 

Restricted Stock Units 

Restricted stock unit grants
are designed to attract and retain employees, and to better align employee interests with those of the Company s stockholders.
For a select group of employees, up to 40% of their annual bonus is settled with fully vested restricted stock unit awards. Under
these fully vested restricted stock unit awards, the holder of each award has the right to receive one share of the Company s
common stock for each fully vested restricted stock unit four years from the date of grant. Each individual who receives a fully
vested restricted stock unit award is also granted a matching number of unvested restricted stock unit awards. Unvested restricted
stock unit awards are also granted for select new hires and promotions. These unvested restricted stock unit awards generally cliff
vest four years from the date of grant, at which time the holder of each award will have the right to receive one share of the
Company s common stock for each restricted stock unit award provided the holder of each award has met certain employment
conditions. In the case of retirement at 59  years or older, all unvested restricted stock unit awards will continue to
vest, provided that the holder of each award does all consulting work through the Company and does not become an employee for a
past or present client, beneficial party or competitor of the Company. 

The value of these restricted
stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The value of
fully vested restricted stock unit awards issued is recorded as a reduction to accrued bonuses. The portion of bonus expense that
the Company expects to settle with fully vested restricted stock unit awards is recorded as stock-based compensation during the
period the bonus is earned. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with accrued bonus awards of $1,548,000
and $1,616,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with accrued bonus awards of $4,716,000
and $4,959,000, respectively. The value of the unvested restricted stock unit awards granted is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the shorter of the four-year vesting period or the period between the grant date and the date the award recipient turns 59 .
If the award recipient is 59  years or older on the date of grant, the value of the entire award is expensed upon grant.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with the unvested restricted stock unit awards of $1,115,000 and
$967,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation
expense associated with the unvested restricted stock unit awards of $5,447,000 and $5,078,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. 

Stock Options 

Stock options are granted
for terms of ten years and generally vest 25% per year over a four-year period from the grant date. Unvested stock option awards
will continue to vest in the case of retirement at 59  years or older, provided that the holder of each award does all consulting
work through the Company and does not become an employee for a past or present client, beneficial party or competitor of the Company.
The Company grants options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants of $67,000 and $51,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated
with stock option grants of $496,000 and $499,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. The determination of the fair value of stock option awards
on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding
a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the award,
actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. 

The Company used historical
exercise and post-vesting forfeiture and expiration data to estimate the expected term of options granted. The historical volatility
of the Company s common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the options granted was used to estimate
expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate used in the option-pricing model was based on United States Treasury zero-coupon
issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options. The dividend yield assumption considers the expectation
of continued declaration of dividends, offset by option holders  dividend equivalent rights. 

With the adoption of
ASU 2016-09 as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Note 1 - Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncement), the Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards when they occur. All stock-based payment awards
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. 

Note 5:  Treasury Stock  

On May 29, 2014, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized $35,000,000 for the repurchase of the Company s common stock. On October 21, 2015, the Company s
Board of Directors authorized an additional $35,000,000 for the repurchase of the Company s common stock. 

The Company repurchased
491,312 shares of its common stock for $24,456,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company repurchased
463,402 shares of its common stock for $19,814,000 during the nine months ended October 2, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016
the Company had remaining authorization under its stock repurchase plans of $22,307,000 to repurchase shares of common stock. 

On October 19, 2016, the
Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized an additional $35,000,000 in share repurchases, increasing the Company s
current authorization to $57,307,000. 

Net losses related to
the re-issuance of treasury stock to settle restricted stock unit and stock option awards of $5,791,000 and $4,943,000 were recorded
as a reduction to retained earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. 

Note 6: Deferred Compensation Plans  

The Company maintains
nonqualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of a select group of highly compensated employees. Under these plans,
participants may elect to defer up to 100% of their compensation. Company assets that are earmarked to pay benefits under the plans
are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of the Company s creditors. As of September 30, 2016 and January
1, 2016, the invested amounts under the plans totaled $46,548,000 and $42,940,000, respectively. These assets are classified as
trading securities and are recorded at fair value with changes recorded as adjustments to miscellaneous income (expense), net. 

As of September 30,
2016 and January 1, 2016, vested amounts due under the plans totaled $51,845,000 and $46,740,000, respectively. Changes in
the liability are recorded as adjustments to compensation expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
October 2, 2015, the Company recognized compensation expense of $1,458,000 and ($2,688,000), respectively, as a result of
changes in the market value of the trust assets with the same amount being recorded as income in  miscellaneous income
(expense), net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, the Company recognized compensation
expense of $2,823,000 and ($1,379,000), respectively, as a result of changes in the market value of the trust assets with the
same amount being recorded as income in miscellaneous income (expense), net.

Business Overview 

Exponent, Inc. is an engineering
and scientific consulting firm that provides solutions to complex problems. Our multidisciplinary team of scientists, physicians,
engineers and business consultants brings together more than 90 different technical disciplines to solve complicated issues facing
industry and business today. Our services include analysis of product development, product recall, regulatory compliance, and the

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

In preparing
our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant
impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe
that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for
contract losses and doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider
these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting
policies have not differed materially from actual results. Policies covering revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for
contract losses and doubtful accounts are described in our 2015 Annual Report under  Critical Accounting
Estimates  and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS 

Executive Summary  

Revenues for the third
quarter of 2016 decreased 2% to $77,612,000 as compared to $78,994,000 during the same period last year. Revenues before reimbursements
for the third quarter of 2016 decreased slightly to $74,160,000 as compared to $74,503,000 during the same period last year. Net
income decreased 4% to $11,289,000 during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $11,719,000 during the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.42 per share as compared to $0.43 in the same period last year. 

The decreases in revenues
and net income were due to softening of demand in a few industry sectors partially offset by an increase in demand related to consumer
products and construction. Recent shifts in market conditions have resulted in reduced revenues from the oil   gas and industrial
chemicals industries and a slowdown in intellectual property cases. Additionally, after several years of growth, revenues from
the automotive industry remained flat in the third quarter. During the third quarter we did see increased activity related to consumer
product recalls and construction disputes. 

We remain focused on
selectively adding top talent and developing the skills necessary to expand our market position and providing clients with
in-depth scientific research and analysis to determine what happened and how to prevent failures or exposures in the future.
We also remain focused on capitalizing on emerging growth areas, managing other operating expenses, generating cash from
operations, maintaining a strong balance sheet and undertaking activities such as share repurchases and dividends to enhance
shareholder value. 

Overview of the Three Months Ended September
30, 2016  

During the third quarter
of 2016, billable hours decreased 3% to 278,000 as compared to 286,000 during the same period last year. Our utilization decreased
to 70% during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 73% during the third quarter of 2015. Technical full-time equivalent employees
increased 2% to 761 during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 749 during the same period last year. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared
to Three Months Ended October 2, 2015  

Revenues   

The increase in
revenues for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment was primarily due to an increase in billing rates. During the third
quarter of 2016, billable hours for this segment decreased by 1% to 214,000 as compared to 216,000 during the same period
last year. Utilization in this segment decreased to 73% during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 77% during the same
period last year. The decreases in billable hours and utilization were due to recent shifts in market conditions, such as
reduced spending in the oil   gas industry and lower demand related to intellectual property cases. Additionally, after
several years of growth, revenues from the automotive industry were flat during the third quarter of 2016. These decreases
were partially offset by increased activity related to consumer product recalls and construction disputes. Technical
full-time equivalent employees in this segment increased 5% to 566 during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 538 for
the same period last year due to our continuing recruiting and retention efforts. 

The decrease in revenues
for our Environmental and Health segment was due to a decrease in billable hours and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange
rates, partially offset by an increase in billing rates. During the third quarter of 2016, billable hours for this segment decreased
by 9% to 64,000 as compared to 70,000 during the same period last year. Utilization in this segment was 63% for the third quarter
of 2016 and 2015. The decrease in billable hours was due to one of our major investigations ending in the third quarter of 2015
and the impact from reduced spending in the oil   gas and industrial chemicals industries. Technical full-time equivalent employees
in this segment decreased by 8% to 195 during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 211 during the same period last year due
to our efforts to align resources with anticipated demand. 

Compensation and Related Expenses   

The increase in
compensation and related expenses during the third quarter of 2016 was due to an increase in payroll expense and a change in
the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan, partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense. Payroll
expense increased $1,295,000 due to the increase in technical full-time equivalent employees and our annual salary increases.
During the third quarter of 2016, deferred compensation expense increased $4,146,000 with a corresponding increase to
miscellaneous income (expense), net, as compared to the same period last year due to the change in value of assets associated
with our deferred compensation plan. This increase consisted of an increase in the value of the plan assets of $1,458,000
during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to a decrease in the value of the plan assets of $2,688,000 during same period
last year. Bonus expense decreased $353,000 during the third quarter of 2016 due to a decrease in income before income taxes,
before bonus expense, and before stock-based compensation expense. 

Other Operating Expenses   

Other operating expenses include facilities-related
costs, technical materials, computer-related expenses and depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.
The increase in other operating expenses during the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense
of $253,000 associated with investments in our corporate infrastructure.
We expect other operating expenses to grow as we selectively add new talent and make investments in our corporate infrastructure. 

Reimbursable Expenses   

The amount of reimbursable
expenses will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the nature of our projects. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

The decrease in general
and administrative expenses during the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to decreases in legal fees and travel   meals,
partially offset by an increase in bad debt. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we selectively add new
talent, expand our business development initiatives and pursue staff development initiatives. 

Other Income (Expense), Net   

Other income
(expense), net, consists primarily of changes in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan, interest
income earned on available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and rental income from leasing space in our
Silicon Valley facility. During the third quarter of 2016, other income (expense), net, increased $4,146,000 with a
corresponding increase to deferred compensation expense, as compared to the same period last year, due to a change in the
value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This increase consisted of an increase in the value of the
plan assets of $1,458,000 during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to a decrease in the value of the plan assets of
$2,688,000 during the same period last year. 

Income Taxes   

The decrease in income
taxes was due to a corresponding decrease in pre-tax income. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared
to Nine Months Ended October 2, 2015  

Revenues    

The increase
in revenues for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment was primarily due to an increase in billable hours and
billing rates. During the first nine months of 2016, billable hours for this segment increased 2% to 649,000 as compared to
635,000 during the same period last year. Utilization in this segment decreased to 74% during the first nine months of 2016
as compared to 76% during the same period last year. The increase in billable hours was due to demand for our services in
our civil engineering, polymer science   materials chemistry, and materials   corrosion engineering practices.
The decrease in utilization was due to recent shifts in market conditions, such as reduced spending in the oil   
gas industry and lower demand related to intellectual property cases. Technical full-time equivalent employees in this segment
increased 6% to 563 during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 533 for the same period last year due to our
continuing recruiting and retention efforts. 

The decrease
in revenues for our Environmental and Health segment was due to a decrease in billable hours and the impact of unfavorable
foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in billing rates. During the first nine months of 2016, billable
hours for this segment decreased by 13% to 199,000 as compared to 229,000 during the same period last year. Utilization in
this segment decreased to 63% for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 68% for the same period last year. The
decrease in billable hours and utilization was due to one of our major investigations ending in the third quarter of 2015 and
the impact from reduced spending in the oil   gas and industrial chemicals
industries.
Technical full-time equivalent employees in this segment decreased by 6% to 203 during the first nine months of 2016 as
compared to 215 during the same period last year due to our efforts to align resources with anticipated demand. 

Compensation and Related Expenses   

The increase
in compensation and related expenses during the first nine months of 2016 was due to an increase in payroll expense and a
change in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan, partially offset by a decrease in bonus
expense. Payroll expense increased $3,897,000 due to the increase in technical full-time equivalent employees and our annual
salary increases. During the first nine months of 2016, deferred compensation expense increased $4,202,000 with a
corresponding increase to miscellaneous income (expense), net, as compared to the same period last year, due to the change in
value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This increase consisted of an increase in the value of the
plan assets of $2,823,000 during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to a decrease in the value of the plan assets of
$1,379,000 during the same period last year. Bonus expense decreased $1,471,000 during the first nine months of 2016 due to a
decrease in income before income taxes, before bonus expense, and before stock-based compensation expense. 

Other Operating Expenses   

Other operating expenses
include facilities-related costs, technical materials, computer-related expenses and depreciation and amortization of property,
equipment and leasehold improvements. The increase in other operating expenses during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily
due to an increase in depreciation expense of $475,000, an increase in occupancy expense of $394,000, an increase in computer expense
of $164,000 and several individually insignificant increases, all of which were associated with the increase in technical full-time
equivalent employees and investments in our corporate infrastructure. 

Reimbursable Expenses   

The amount of reimbursable
expenses will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the nature of our projects. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

The decrease in
general and administrative expenses during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in outside
consulting services and legal fees, partially offset by an increase in bad debt. 

Other Income (Expense), Net   

Other
income (expense), net, consists primarily of changes in the value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan,
interest income earned on available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and rental income from leasing space
in our Silicon Valley facility. During the first nine months of 2016, other income (expense), net, increased $4,202,000 with
a corresponding increase to deferred compensation expense, as compared to the same period last year, due to a change in the
value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. This increase consisted of an increase in the value of the
plan assets of $2,823,000 during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to a decrease in the value of the plan assets of
$1,379,000 during the same period last year. The increase in other income (expense), net, during the first nine months of 2016 was
also due to an increase in interest income of $374,000 and an increase in rental income of $226,000. 

Income Taxes   

The decrease in income
taxes and the decrease in our effective tax rate were primarily due to the early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, on a prospective
basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Under ASU No. 2016-09 excess tax benefits are recorded as an income tax benefit
in the condensed consolidated statement of income. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits were recognized
in additional paid-in capital. The tax benefit realized during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was $4,827,000. Excluding the
excess tax benefit, the effective tax rate would have been 38.3%. The decrease in our effective tax rate, excluding the impact
of ASU No. 2016-09, was due to an increase in foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower income tax rates. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We financed our business
during the first nine months of 2016 through available cash. We invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short-term investments.
As of September 30, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $150.4 million compared to $171.6 million
at January 1, 2016. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to
satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, stock repurchases, dividends and other liquidity
requirements over at least the next twelve months. 

Generally, our net cash
provided by operating activities is used to fund our day to day operating activities. First quarter operating cash requirements
are generally higher due to payment in the first quarter of our annual bonuses accrued during the prior year. Our largest source
of operating cash flows is collections from our clients. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related
expenditures, leased facilities, taxes, and general operating expenses including marketing and travel. Under ASU No. 2016-09, the
excess tax benefit of $4,827,000 for the first nine months of 2016 was classified as an operating activity in the statement of
cash flows. The excess tax benefit of $4,983,000 for the first nine months of 2015 was classified as a financing activity. 

The increase in net
cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period last year, was due to
an increase in capital expenditures and an increase in the purchase of short-term investments. On August 12, 2016, we
completed the purchase of a 1.1 acre parcel of land with 27,000 square feet of warehouse storage space in Menlo Park,
California adjacent to our owned office and lab facilities. We had leased this warehouse storage space for the past 25 years.
The total purchase price was $8,250,000. 

The increase in net cash
used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same period last year, was due to the early
adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 on a prospective basis. Under ASU No. 2016-09, the excess tax benefit of $4,827,000 for the first nine
months of 2016 was classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The excess tax benefit of $4,983,000 for
the first nine months of 2015 was classified as a financing activity. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during
the first nine months of 2016 was also due to an increase in repurchases of our common stock and dividends paid. 

We expect to continue our
investing activities, including capital expenditures. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our
stock repurchase programs, pay dividends or strategically acquire professional service firms that are complementary to our business. 

For
a summary of our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations, see  Item 7. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2016. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since
January 1, 2016.  

We maintain a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan for the benefit of a select group of highly compensated employees. Vested amounts due under the plan
of $45,662,000 were recorded as a long-term liability on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.
Company assets that are earmarked to pay benefits under the plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of our
creditors. As of September 30, 2016, invested amounts under the plan of $40,365,000 were recorded as a long-term asset on our unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

As permitted under Delaware
law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or
director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.   The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and
occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime.   The maximum potential amount of future payments we
could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance
coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Regulation G, Conditions
for Use of Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( Non-GAAP ) Financial Measures, and other SEC rules and regulations
define and prescribe the conditions for use of Non-GAAP financial information. Generally, a Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical
measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally
excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We closely monitor
two financial measures, EBITDA and EBITDAS, which meet the definition of Non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA as net income
before income taxes, net interest income, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAS as EBITDA before stock-based compensation.
The Company regards EBITDA and EBITDAS as useful measures of operating performance to complement operating income, net income and
other GAAP financial performance measures. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and EBITDAS provide meaningful comparisons
of past, present and future operating results. These measures are used to evaluate our financial results, develop budgets and determine
employee compensation. These measures, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute or superior to, operating
income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP
measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure is set forth below. 

The following table shows
EBITDA (determined as shown in the reconciliation table below) as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015: 

The decrease in EBITDA
as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period last year was
due to the decrease in utilization. Utilization for the third quarter of 2016 was 70% as compared to 73% during the same period
last year. The decrease in utilization was due to the impact of the completion of a major project during the third quarter of 2015
and recent shifts in market conditions, such as reduced spending in the oil   gas industry and lower demand related to intellectual
property cases. The decrease in utilization was also due to lower demand from the industrial chemicals industry.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

We are exposed to interest
rate risk associated with our balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We manage our interest rate risk by
maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average
effective maturities in accordance with our investment policy. The maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio is
3 years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed 12 months. If interest rates were to instantaneously
increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in the fair market value of our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term
investments would not have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our
portfolio. There have not been any material changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to our interest
rate risk exposures, or how these exposures are managed. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk, there can be
no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. 

We have foreign currency risk related to our
revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British Pound, the Euro, and the Chinese
Yuan. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the revenues and net income of our foreign subsidiaries as expressed
in U.S. dollars. 

At September 30, 2016,
we had net assets of approximately $6.9 million with a functional currency of the British Pound, net assets of approximately $2.7
million with a functional currency of the Euro, and net assets of approximately $3.0 million with a functional currency of the
Chinese Yuan associated with our operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, and China, respectively. 

We also have foreign currency
risk related to foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional
currency. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on
these foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2016, we had net
assets denominated in the non-functional currency of approximately $1.4 million. As such, a ten percent change in the value of
the local currency would result in a $140,000  foreign currency gain or loss in our results of operations. 

We do not use foreign exchange
contracts to hedge any foreign currency exposures. To date, the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our consolidated
revenues and consolidated net income have not been material. However, our continued international growth increases our exposure
to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  

(a)          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that
evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that,
as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

We intend to review and
evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis, to improve our controls and
procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. Our goal is to ensure that our senior
management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning our business. While we believe
the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve our goal, future events affecting our business
may cause us to significantly modify our disclosure controls and procedures. 

(b)          Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected,

Exhibit 10.46  

Clawback Policy  

This Clawback Policy (this    Policy   )
has been adopted by the Board of Directors (the    Board   ) of Exponent Inc. (the    Company   )
effective as of September 29, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ) in advance of the effective date of the final
rules or regulations (   Final Regulations   ) expected to be adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the effective date of the listing requirements expected to be adopted by the NASDAQ Stock Market that would implement
the incentive-based compensation recovery requirements set forth in Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
   Exchange Act   ), as added by Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act. 

1.   Recovery of Excessive Incentive-Based
Compensation.   In the event that following the Effective Date the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement
due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws
(a    Triggering Event   ), the Company will use reasonable efforts to recover, subject to the terms of this
Policy, from any current or former Officer of the Company (a) who was paid or granted Incentive-Based Compensation on or after
the Effective Date and (b) whom the Board has determined has willfully committed an act of fraud, dishonesty or recklessness in
the performance of his or her duties as an Officer that contributed to the noncompliance that resulted in the Company s obligation
to prepare the accounting restatement (   Misconduct  ,  and each such current or former Officer that the
Board determines to have engaged in Misconduct, a    Culpable Employee   ), all Excessive Incentive-Based
Compensation. 

2.   Definitions.   For purposes of
this Policy, the following terms have the meanings indicated, in addition to the other terms defined herein: 

(a)    Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation   
means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation paid or granted by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to a Culpable
Employee on or after the Effective Date in excess of what would have been paid or granted to that Culpable Employee under the circumstances
reflected by the accounting restatement, but in no event will such Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation exceed the total amount
of such Incentive-Based Compensation originally paid or granted to that Culpable Employee on or after the Effective Date. 

(b)    Incentive-Based Compensation    
 means, with respect to a Culpable Employee: 
(1) the amount of the Culpable Employee s annual incentive awards paid under the Company s annual cash incentive compensation
program; (2) the stock options and performance-based equity or equity-based awards (or any amount attributable to such awards)
paid or granted to the Culpable Employee under the Company s long-term incentive equity program; and (3) any other incentive-based
compensation paid or granted in respect of Company and/or individual performance to a Culpable Employee pursuant to an  incentive
plan,  as such term is defined in Item 402(a)(6)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 

(c)    Officer    all
individuals appointed as such by the Board of Directors. 

3.   Process.   If the Board determines
following the occurrence of a Triggering Event that one or more Culpable Employees has engaged in Misconduct, the Board, after
considering the recommendations of the Human Resources Committee of the Board, will review each Culpable Employee s Incentive-Based
Compensation and, with respect to each Culpable Employee, will take prompt and reasonable action in accordance with this Policy
to seek recovery of all Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation. There shall be no duplication of recovery under this Policy and
any of 15 U.S.C. Section 7243 (Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) or Section 10D of the Exchange Act. 

4.   Interpretation of this Policy; Determinations
by the Board.   The Board currently intends that this Policy will remain operative until the effective date of the Final
Regulations. The Board may at any time in its sole discretion supplement or amend any provision of this Policy in any respect,
repeal this Policy in whole or part or adopt a new policy relating to recovery of incentive-based compensation with such terms
as the Board determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate. The Board has the exclusive power and authority to administer
this Policy, including, without limitation, the right and power to interpret the provisions of this Policy and to make all determinations
deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Policy, including, without limitation, any determination as to (a)
whether a Triggering Event has occurred; (b) whether Misconduct has occurred; (c) whether any current or former Executive Officer
is a Culpable Employee; and (d) what constitutes Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation. All such actions, interpretations and
determinations that are taken or made by the Board in good faith will be final, conclusive and binding. 

5.  Limitation on Period for Recovery. 
 The Board may seek recovery of any Excessive Incentive-Based Compensation received in the three (3) completed fiscal years
preceding the accounting restatement if the Board determines that the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement
due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws.
