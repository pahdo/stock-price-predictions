September 30, 2016 

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all the
information and note disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ) by Exactus, Inc. (formerly known as Spiral
Energy Tech, Inc. and Solid Solar Energy, Inc.)
( Exactus ,  our ,  us ,
 we  or the  Company  refer to Exactus,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context otherwise
requires) on February 29, 2016. On February 29, 2016, after
acquiring all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Exactus
BioSolutions, Inc., the Company changed its business focus from
drone technology to a life science company. With this change in
industry focus, a comparison of the Company s financial
statements for the current accounting periods to prior periods is
not meaningful and should not be used to derive conclusions about
trends in the Company s financial performance and position
over time.     In
the opinion of management, this interim information includes all
material adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature,
necessary for fair presentation.   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the entire year or for any other period. 

We
adopted early application of Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of
Certain Financial Reporting Requirements effective September 30,
2014, therefore, inception-to-date information and other remaining
disclosure requirements of Topic 915 are not presented or
disclosed. 

NOTE 2. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND GOING CONCERN 

Organization and Business Description 

Exactus was incorporated on January 18, 2008 as
 Solid Solar Energy, Inc.  in the State of Nevada as a
for-profit Company.   On May 16, 2013, we
filed a certificate of amendment to the Company s amended and
restated articles of incorporation to change our name to
 Spiral Energy Tech., Inc.  from Solid Solar Energy,
Inc.  On February 29, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Exactus BioSolutions, Inc.
( Exactus BioSolutions ) pursuant to a Share Exchange
Agreement, dated February 29, 2016, with Exactus BioSolutions (the
 Share Exchange ). T  he Company issued 30 million shares of
newly-designated Series B-1 Preferred Stock to the shareholders of
Exactus BioSolutions in the Share Exchange, representing
approximately 87% of voting control of the Company upon
consummation of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share
Exchange, Exactus BioSolutions became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Exactus, Inc. Effective March 22, 2016, we changed our corporate
name to  Exactus, Inc.  via a merger with our
wholly-owned subsidiary, Exactus Acquisition
Corp.     

Following the Share Exchange, we became a life
science company that plans to develop and commercialize
Point-of-Care ( POC ) diagnostics for measuring
proteolytic enzymes in the blood based on a proprietary detection
platform (the  New Business ). Our primary product, the
FibriLyzer, will employ a disposable test  biosensor 
strip combined with a portable and easy to use hand held detection
unit that provides a result in less than 30 seconds.  The
initial markets we intend to pursue for the FibriLyzer are 
(i) the management of hyperfibrinolytic states associate with
surgery and trauma, (ii) obstetrics, (iii) acute events such as
myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, (iv) pulmonary embolism
and deep vein thrombosis and (v) chronic coronary disease
management. We expect to follow up the FibriLyzer with similar
technology, the MatriLyzer, to detect collagenase levels in the
blood for the detection of the recurrence of cancer.  We intend to file to gain regulatory approval to
sell our products in the United States, Canada and
Europe.  Management intends to primarily focus on the
development and commercialization of the FibriLyzer and related
technology exclusively licensed by
Exactus.    

-4- 

Table of Contents  

Prior
to our acquisition of Exactus BioSolutions pursuant to the Share
Exchange, our primary business focus was on developing and
commercializing drone technology (the  Former
Business ). 

As
of September 30, 2016, we had no products available for sale. There
can be no assurance that our technology will be approved for sale
or, if approved for sale, be commercially successful. In addition,
we operate in an environment of rapid change in technology and are
dependent upon the continued services of our current consultants
and subcontractors. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $34,494 of cash and, subsequently
on October 27, 2016, we raised an additional $1,500,000 in cash
through the sale of preferred stock.(See Note 8. Subsequent
Events). We expect that these funds will not be sufficient to
enable us to complete the development of any potential products,
including the FibriLyzer. Accordingly, we will need to obtain
further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt
financing, collaboration arrangements or other sources in order to
continue our business. The issuance of any additional shares of
common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities could be
substantially dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, adequate
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we are unable to raise capital, we would be forced to
delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs
and may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

These
financial statements are presented on the basis that we will
continue as a going concern. The going concern concept contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. No adjustment has been made to the
carrying amount and classification of our assets and the carrying
amount of our liabilities based on the going concern uncertainty.
We have considered ASU 2014-15 in consideration of reporting
requirements of the going concern financial
statements. 

The
audit report prepared by our independent registered public
accounting firm relating to our financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph
expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern. We have concluded that the circumstances described
above continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern as of September 30, 2016. 

The
Company s headquarters are located at 4870 Sadler Road, Suite
300, Glen Allen, Virginia 23060.  The Company s
fiscal year end is December 31. 

NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited interim
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in annual
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures
made are adequate to make the information not
misleading.     

Cash and
Cash Equivalents  

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The carrying value of those investments approximates their fair
market value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts on deposit with
financial institutions, which amounts may at times exceed federally
insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts
and we do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit
risk. 

Cash and cash equivalents were $34,494 and $72,342 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets Including Other Acquired Intangible
Assets 

Property
and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed by
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, which is
between 3 years for computer equipment and 5-20 years for
production equipment.   The carrying amount of all long-lived
assets is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the
depreciation and amortization period or the unamortized balance is
warranted. Due to a change in business focus to a life science
company in February 2016, we recognized a loss on disposal of drone
equipment of $1,453 and impairment of patents for drone technology
of $4,080 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

Revenue Recognition 

We recognize revenue when it is realized or
realizable and estimable in accordance with ASC 605,
   Revenue
Recognition   .

Research and Development Expenses 

We follow ASC 730-10,    Research and
Development,    and
expense research and development costs when incurred. 
Accordingly, third-party research and development costs, including
designing, prototyping and testing of product, are expensed when
the contracted work has been performed or milestone results have
been achieved.   Research and development costs of
$97,244 were incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and $216,644 were incurred for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 in connection with the New Business. Research and development
costs of $25,079 and $77,344 were incurred for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, in connection with
the former business.  

Related Parties 

We
follow ASC 850,  Related Party
Disclosures,  for the identification of related parties
and disclosure of related party transactions.  For the three
and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, $75,000 and
$175,000, respectively, were recognized in Research and Development
expenses for consulting provided by a director and shareholder. In
addition, $50,000 was paid to a director and shareholder during the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016 for the Licensing
Agreement disclosed in Note 4. 

Earnings per Share 

We compute basic and diluted earnings per share
amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260,
   Earnings
per Share  .  Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if preferred stock converted to common stock and warrants are
exercised.  Preferred stock and warrants are excluded
from the diluted earnings per share calculation if their effect is
anti-dilutive.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had 8,784,001 shares and
warrants that were excluded from our calculation of diluted
earnings per share because their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no shares
that were considered to be anti-dilutive. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. The Company is required to record all components of
comprehensive income (loss) in the financial statements in the
period in which they are recognized. Net income (loss) and other
comprehensive income (loss), are reported net of their related tax
effect, to arrive at comprehensive income (loss).  Other
comprehensive gain was $0 and $515 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations
thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported
and in future periods. We have carefully considered the new
pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting
principles and do not believe that any new or modified principles
will have a material impact on the corporation s reported
financial position or operations in the near term. The
applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of
the Company s financial management. 

NOTE 4.  AGREEMENTS 

Through
the Share Exchange, the Company acquired an exclusive license
agreement (the  Licensing Agreement ) between Exactus
BioSolutions and Digital Diagnostics Inc.( Digital
Diagnostics ) that the Company recognized as an intangible
asset.   Pursuant to the Licensing Agreement,
Digital Diagnostics granted to Exactus BioSolutions an exclusive
license to develop, produce and commercialize certain diagnostic
products, including the FibriLyzer and MatriLyzer, that utilize
certain intellectual property rights owned or licensed by Digital
Diagnostics. The Licensing Agreement provides for Exactus
BioSolutions and Digital Diagnostics to collaborate through the
various steps of the product and device development process,
including the development, regulatory approval and
commercialization stages. Exactus BioSolutions is required to pay
Digital Diagnostics, in cash and/or stock, an initial signing
payment, milestone fees triggered by the first regulatory clearance
or approval of each of the FibriLyzer and the MatriLyzer, and
various sales thresholds, and royalty payments based on the net
sales of the products, calculated on a product-by-product basis. No
milestones have been met and no milestone fees have been paid or
accrued for through September 30, 2016.

Table of Contents  

The
License Agreement is effective until such time as neither Digital
Diagnostics nor Exactus Biosolutions has any obligation to the
other under the License Agreement in any country with respect to
any product. The License Agreement may be terminated by the Company
effective upon at least six (6) months written notice if regulatory
approval has been obtained in the U.S. or in the European Union, or
upon at least three (3) months written notice if regulatory
approval has not been obtained in the U.S. or in the European
Union. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the
event the other party materially breaches the License Agreement, or
becomes insolvent. 

On
June 30, 2016, in order to conduct a clinical trial for the
FibriLyzer and other studies, the Company entered into a Master
Services Agreement (the  MSA ) with Integrium LLC
( Integrium ) and PoC Capital, LLC ( PoC
Capital ). Under the MSA, Integrium has agreed to perform
clinical research services in support of the development of POC
diagnostics devices.  Integrium is to conduct one or more
studies in compliance with FDA regulations and pursuant to the
Company s specific service orders.   PoC Capital
has agreed to fund up to the first $1,000,000 in study costs and
fees due to Integrium, with all fees in costs in excess of that
amount being the Company s sole responsibility, in exchange
for 1,600,000 shares of the Company s common stock, 1,733,334
shares of newly designated Series C Preferred Stock, and 1,666,667
warrants to purchase the Company s common stock at a price of
$0.60 per share exercisable for three years. The Company has
accounted $1,000,000 as prepaid expenses on the balance sheet. See
Note 5 below for additional information regarding the
Company s common stock, Series C Preferred Stock and
warrants. 

NOTE 5. EQUITY TRANSACTIONS 

Recapitalization and Change in Control 

On
February 29, 2016, the Company consummated the Share Exchange,
which resulted in a change in control of the Company. As part of
this transaction, the Company acquired a $50,000 license agreement
and $1,292 in cash and assumed liabilities of $51,000. The Company
initially reported an issuance of 32 million shares of newly
designated Series B-1 Preferred Stock to the shareholders of
Exactus BioSolutions in the Share Exchange. Due to an anticipated
pre-acquisition investment in Exactus BioSolutions that was not
made, the final total issued shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock
was 30 million. 

The
Company has considered the guidance pursuant to Rule 11-01(d) of
Regulation S-X and related interpretations and has concluded the
acquisition of Exactus BioSolutions pursuant to the Share
Exchange is the acquisition of an asset and not of a
business.  The license agreement and shareholder loans
have been accounted for and recorded at historical
cost. 

Concurrently
with the closing of the Share Exchange, the Company closed a
private offering of Series B-2 Preferred Stock.  The
Company sold a total of 2,084,000 shares of Series B-2 Preferred
Stock at an offering price of $0.25 per share, for an aggregate
subscription price of $521,000. The Company originally reported a
total of 2,884,000 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock being
issued in the offering. Due to: (i) an anticipated investment for
1,000,000 shares which was not made, and (ii) an additional
subscription for 200,000 shares for which documentation had not
been completed at that time, however, the final total issued shares
of Series B-2 Preferred Stock was 2,084,000. The shares sold in the
offering included 400,000 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock
issued to extinguish a $100,000 loan and 204,000 shares of Series
B-2 preferred stock issued to former creditors of Exactus
BioSolutions in exchange for their release of $51,000 in debt owed
by Exactus.  After accounting for these issuances, net
cash proceeds from the offering were $370,000.  No
underwriting discounts or commissions have been or will be paid in
connection with the sale of Series B-2 Preferred
Stock. 

Also
on February 29, 2016, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements
with certain holders of common stock holding an aggregate of
393,314 post-split (11,636,170 pre-split) shares of common
stock.  Under the Exchange Agreements, these shareholders
exchanged their common stock for a total of 4,558,042 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock. These exchanges consisted of: (i)
thirteen common stock holders holding 10,894,070 (pre-split) shares
of common stock who exchanged their common stock for 3,458,042
shares Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in a (pre-split)
exchange ratio of approximately 1 for 3.15, and (ii) one
shareholder who, under a separately negotiated agreement, exchanged
742,100 (pre-split) shares common stock for 1,100,000 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, resulting at a (pre-split) exchange ratio
of approximately 1.48 for 1.  Immediately following such
share exchanges, the Company repurchased 50,000 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock from a shareholder for a total price of
$50,000. 

Reverse Stock Split 

Effective
March 22, 2016, the Company performed a reverse split of common
stock on a 1 for 29.5849 basis, pursuant to the prior approval by
the Board of Directors and a majority of
shareholders.  On March 22, 2016, the effective date of
the reverse split, the Company had approximately 3,608,715 shares
of common stock issued and outstanding, which were split into
121,978 shares of common stock. The par value of the common stock
was unchanged at $0.0001 per share, post-split. All per share
information in the condensed financial statements gives retroactive
effect to the 1 for 29.5849 reverse stock split that was effected
on March 22, 2016.

Also
on February 17, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors voted

except as may be declared by the Board in its sole and absolute
discretion, out of funds legally available for that purpose. Shares
of Series B-2 Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the
holder, into shares of common stock on a one (1) for one (1)
basis.  Holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock have the
right to vote as-if-converted to common stock on all matters

Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series B-1 Preferred
Stock ), consisting of up to thirty-two million (32,000,000)

Stock ranks pari passu to the class of common stock.
Shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock have no dividend rights except
as may be declared by the Board in its sole and absolute
discretion, out of funds legally available for that purpose. Shares
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the
holder, into shares of common stock on a one (1) for one (1) basis.

as-if-converted to common stock on all matters submitted to a vote
of holders of the Company s common stock. On February 29,

rights and is convertible to common stock on a 1 for 1
basis.  The conversion rights of holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock are limited such that no holder may convert any
shares of preferred stock to the extent that such holder,
immediately following the conversion, would own in excess of 4.99%
of our issued and outstanding shares of common
stock.  This limitation may be increased to 9.99% upon 61
days written notice by a holder of the Series C Preferred Stock to
the Company.  On June 30, 2016, the Company issued

General 

On
February 29, 2016, the Company consummated a share exchange, which
resulted in a change in control of the Company. As part of this
transaction, the Company acquired Exactus BioSolutions, Inc.
( Exactus BioSolutions ) and its exclusive license
agreement (the  Licensing Agreement ) with Digital
Diagnostics Inc.( Digital Diagnostics ) to develop,
produce and commercialize blood diagnostic products that utilize
certain intellectual property rights owned or licensed by Digital
Diagnostics. The Licensing Agreement provides for Exactus
BioSolutions and Digital Diagnostics to collaborate through the
various steps of the product and device development process,
including the development, regulatory approval and
commercialization stages.

As a result of this transaction, Exactus became a
life science company that plans to develop and commercialize
pursuant to the Licensing Agreement Point-of-Care
( POC ) diagnostics for measuring proteolytic enzymes
in the blood based on a proprietary detection platform (the
 New Business ). Our primary product, the FibriLyzer,
will employ a disposable test  biosensor  strip
combined with a portable and easy to use hand held detection unit
that provides a result in less than 30 seconds. The initial
markets we intend to pursue for the FibriLyzer are  (i) the
management of hyperfibrinolytic states associate with surgery and
trauma, (ii) obstetrics, (iii) acute events such as myocardial
infarction and ischemic stroke, (iv) pulmonary embolism and deep
vein thrombosis and (v) chronic coronary disease management. We
expect to follow up the FibriLyzer with similar technology, the
MatriLyzer to detect collagenase levels in the blood for the
detection of the recurrence of cancer.  We intend to file to gain regulatory approval to
sell our products in the United States, Canada and
Europe.  Management intends to primarily focus on the
development and commercialization of the FibriLyzer and related
technology exclusively licensed pursuant to the Licensing
Agreement.  

Prior
to our acquisition of Exactus BioSolutions on February 29, 2016,
our primary business focus was on developing and commercializing
drone technology (the  Former Business ). Because we
have changed our primary business focus, we do not believe a
comparison of the Company s financial results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the Company s
financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 is meaningful. 

On
June 30, 2016, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with
Integrium, LLC and PoC Capital, LLC to conduct clinical studies for
us, including a clinical trial for the FibriLyzer that is scheduled
to begin early in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015: 

Operating
expenses increased by $257,385, from $102,428 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 to $359,813 for the comparable period
ended September 30, 2016. The difference primarily is attributable
to: the change in business focus to the New Business, an increase
in professional expense due to patent expense and change in
corporate and securities counsel of $74,251, an increase in R D
expense of $72,165; and an increase in general and administration
expenses of $111,220 resulting from an increase in management fees
due to the addition of full time staff in February 2016. We expect
operating expenses to continue to increase throughout 2016 as we
begin a clinical trial in the fourth quarter. 

The
Company had other loss of $10,200 for the three month period ended
September 30, 2015 due to the impairment of marketable securities
recorded in 2015. 

As
a result of the foregoing, we generated a net loss of $359,813 for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a
net loss of $112,268 for the three month period ended September 30,
2015, a change of $247,185.

Table of Contents  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2015: 

Operating
expenses increased by $534,424, from $319,630 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to $854,054 for the comparable period
ended September 30, 2016. The difference primarily is attributable
to: the acquisition of Exactus and change in business focus to the
New Business, an increase in professional and compliance fees of
approximately $125,522 resulting from the acquisition, patent
expense, and associated  public company  activities; an
increase in R D expense due to new business focus of
approximately $139,300; and an increase general and administration
expenses of approximately $287,524 resulting from hiring two full
time staff in February 2016 and an increase in travel. 

As
a result of the foregoing, we generated an operating loss of
$854,054 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to an operating loss of $319,630 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2015, a change of $534,424. 

The
Company had other loss of $1,453 for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to $10,200 for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other loss is
attributable to the impairment of marketable securities recorded in
2015. 

As
a result of the foregoing, we generated a net loss from continuing
operations of $855,507 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of
$329,830 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, a
change of $525,677. Net loss for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016 was $855,507 compared to $329,617 for the nine
month period ended September 30, 2015 which included $213 revenue
from discontinued operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since
our inception in 2008, we have generated losses from operations. As
of September 30, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $1,592,466 of
which $736,959 was related to the Former Business.  Our
net loss for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was $855,507 and $329,617, respectively. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016 was $484,140. We recorded a net loss for the
nine month period of $855,507. Other items in uses of funds from
operations included non-cash charges related to bad debt, loss on
disposal of equipment, and equipment impairment, which collectively
totaled $12,543. Increases in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities increased net cash from operating activities by
$359,996. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2015 was $570,878. We recorded a net loss of $329,617
for the period. Other items in uses of funds from operations
included expenses incurred on behalf of parent company of $329,665
slightly offset by non-cash charges related to bad debt,
depreciation, and impairment, which collectively totaled $33,906.
Net changes in accrued liabilities, receivables and other
assets increased cash by $54,498. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $1,292 due to the acquisition of
Exactus BioSolutions. Net cash provided by investing activity for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 was $0. 

-12- 

Table of Contents  

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $445,000 largely due to proceeds from
our issuance of shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and offset by
our payment for Series A Preferred Stock Series.  Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2015 was $540,896 due to proceeds from a
related party. 

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $34,494 of cash and, subsequently on
October 27, 2016, we raised an additional $1,500,000 in cash
through the sale of preferred stock. We expect that these funds
will not be sufficient to enable us to complete the development of
any potential products, including the FibriLyzer and related
technology. Accordingly, we will need to obtain further funding
through public or private equity offerings, debt financing,
collaboration arrangements or other sources. The issuance of any
additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or convertible
securities could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders. In
addition, adequate additional funding may not be available to us on
acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital, we
will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and
development programs and may not be able to continue as a going
concern. 

Going Concern 

The
audit report prepared by our independent registered public
accounting firm relating to our financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph
expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern. We have concluded that the circumstances described
above continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern as of September 30, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2016, we had no material off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

In
the normal course of business, we may be confronted with issues or
events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally
relate to lawsuits, claims or the actions of various regulatory
agencies. We consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to
assess the claim. If, in our opinion, we have incurred a probable
loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, an estimate is made of the loss and the
appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our financial
statements. After consultation with legal counsel, we do not
anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or
threatened lawsuits and claims will have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and New Accounting
Pronouncements 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements.
Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it
requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the
estimate was made, and changes in the estimate or different
estimates that could have been selected could have a material
impact on our results of operations or financial
condition. 

Application of Significant Accounting Policies 

Section
107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can
take advantage of the extended transition period provided in
Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or
revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth
company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended
transition period. Our financial statements may, therefore, not be
comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or
revised accounting standards. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations
thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported
and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new
pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting
principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles
will have a material impact on the corporation s reported
financial position or operations in the near term. The
applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of
our financial management and certain standards are under
consideration.

IT E M 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive and financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial
Officer ( CFO ), the Company s principal
executive and financial officers, have conducted an evaluation of
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their
costs. 

Our
CEO and CFO believe that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure
controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance
level and are ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that
information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion was
due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in
disclosure controls and procedures due to our small size and
limited resources: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and
effective risk assessment; (ii) insufficient written policies and
procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to
the requirements and application of both U.S. GAAP and SEC
Guidelines; (iii) inadequate security and restricted access to
computer systems including insufficient disaster recovery plans;
and (iv) no written whistleblower policy. 

Our
CEO and CFO plan to review and implement appropriate disclosure
controls and procedures to remediate these material weaknesses,
including (i) appointing additional qualified personnel to address
inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management;
(ii) adopting sufficient written policies and procedures for
accounting and financial reporting and a whistle blower policy; and
(iii) implementing sufficient security and restricted access
measures regarding our computer systems and implement a disaster
recovery plan. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal over financial reporting.
