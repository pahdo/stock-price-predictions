NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

September 30, 2016 

(Unaudited) 

NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings ), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the  Company  or  AMC ), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States. Holdings is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. ( Wanda ), a Chinese private conglomerate. 

On March 31, 2016, AMC Entertainment Inc. ( AMCE ) merged with and into Holdings, its direct parent company. In connection with the merger, Holdings assumed all of the obligations of AMCE pursuant to the indentures to the 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 ( Notes due 2022 ), the 5.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 ( Notes due 2025 ) and the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 (as subsequently amended). 

As of September 30, 2016, Wanda owned approximately 77.82% of Holdings  outstanding common stock and 91.32% of the combined voting power of Holdings  outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings  affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of the Company s assets and other extraordinary transactions. 

Use of Estimates:    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to: (1) Impairments, (2) Film exhibition costs, (3) Income and operating taxes, (4) Theatre and other closure expense, and (5) Gift card and exchange ticket income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Principles of Consolidation:    The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above, and should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, these interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial position and results of operations. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. There are no noncontrolling (minority) interests in the Company s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, all of its stockholders  equity, net earnings and total comprehensive income for the periods presented are attributable to controlling interests. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company s business, results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. The Company manages its business under one reportable segment called Theatrical Exhibition.

Other Expense (income):    The following table sets forth the components of other expense: 

Changes in Accounting Principles:    The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03 and 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) as of the beginning of 2016 on a retrospective basis. As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15, the Company reclassified $21,768,000 of debt issuance costs for its term loan and senior subordinated notes from other long-term assets to corporate borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. The Company continues to defer and present its debt issuance costs related to its line-of-credit arrangement as an asset regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement as provided in ASU No. 2015-15. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company early adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as of the beginning of 2016. The effect of adopting ASU 2016-09 is reflected in Stockholders  Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment. This guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification in the statement of cash flows. As permitted under ASU 2016-09, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur. A summary of the changes made to the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015, is included in the following table: 

NOTE 2 ACQUISITION 

In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of SMH Theatres, Inc. ( Starplex Cinemas ) for cash. The purchase price for Starplex Cinemas was $172,172,000, net of cash acquired, and was subject to working capital and other purchase price adjustments as described in the stock purchase agreement. Starplex Cinemas operated 33 theatres with 346 screens in small and mid size markets in 12 states, which further complements the Company s large market portfolio. The Company expects to realize synergies and cost savings related to this acquisition as a result of purchasing and procurement economies of scale and general and administrative expense savings, particularly with respect to the consolidation of corporate related functions and elimination of redundancies. 

The acquisition is being treated as a purchase in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,   Business Combinations,   which requires allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction. The allocation of purchase price is based on management s judgment after evaluating several factors, including bid prices from potential buyers and a preliminary valuation assessment. The allocation of purchase price is preliminary and subject to changes as an appraisal of both tangible and intangible assets and liabilities is finalized, working capital and other purchase price adjustments are completed and additional information regarding the tax bases of assets and liabilities becomes available. The following is a summary of a preliminary allocation of the purchase price:

Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals, and market comparables. 

In connection with the acquisition of Starplex Cinemas, the Company classified two Starplex Cinemas theatres with 22 screens as held for sale as of December 31, 2015, that were divested in January 2016 as required by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. Assets held for sale of approximately $5,390,000 were classified as other current assets in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015.

The shares of Class A common stock, subject to the stockholder agreement, are classified as temporary equity, apart from permanent equity, as a result of the contingent redemption feature contained in the stockholder agreement. The Company determined the amount reflected in temporary equity for the Class A common stock based on the price paid per share by the management stockholders and Wanda on August 30, 2012, the date Wanda acquired Holdings.

NOTE 5 INCOME TAXES 

The Company s effective income tax rate is based on expected income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. For interim financial reporting, the Company   

15 

Table of Contents  

estimates the annual income tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and records a quarterly income tax provision or benefit in accordance with the anticipated annual rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any. The Company refines the estimates of the year s taxable income as new information becomes available, including actual year to date financial results. This continual estimation process often results in a change to the expected effective income tax rate for the year. When this occurs, the Company adjusts the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected income tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. The Company recognizes income tax-related interest expense and penalties as income tax expense and general and administrative expense, respectively. 

The effective tax rate based on the projected annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2016 is 39.75%. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 39.75% and 36.9%, respectively. The Company s tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and permanent items. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company received a favorable state ruling that resulted in a reduction of uncertain tax positions and as a result, the Company recorded a net discrete tax benefit of approximately $2,900,000.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company received a notice of proposed adjustment from the Internal Revenue Service based upon its ongoing review of the Company's tax return for the fiscal period ended March 29, 2012. As a result of this notification, the Company recorded a net discrete tax provision of $1,900,000 for interest on the proposed adjustment ($1,200,000 net of tax), reinstated approximately $17,700,000 of deferred tax assets and recorded current interest and taxes payable of $19,600,000. The Company has also calculated additional estimated New Jersey tax liability of approximately $694,000 resulting from the proposed adjustment. The net impact of these discrete items reduced the Company's projected annual effective rate for the year to 37.9% and the actual rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 36.9%. 

NOTE 6 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business. The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine the fair values. The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 

Level 1:  

Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2:  

Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.  

Level 3:  

Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.  

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.    The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016:

The investments relate to a non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement on behalf of certain management. The Company has an equivalent liability for this related-party transaction recorded in other long-term liabilities for the deferred compensation obligation.     

Valuation Techniques.    The Company s money market mutual funds are invested in funds that seek to preserve principal, are highly liquid, and therefore are recorded on the balance sheet at the principal amounts deposited, which equals fair value. The equity securities, available for sale, primarily consist of common stock and mutual funds invested in equity, fixed income, and international funds and are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. See Note 8     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for the unrealized gain on the equity securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. 

Other Fair Value Measurement Disclosures.    The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 

Valuation Technique.    Quoted market prices and observable market based inputs were used to estimate fair value for Level 2 inputs. The Level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. 

NOTE 7 THEATRE AND OTHER CLOSURE AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS 

A rollforward of reserves for theatre and other closure and disposition of assets is as follows: 

In the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of September 30, 2016, the current portion of the ending balance totaling $8,079,000 is included with accrued expenses and other liabilities and the long-term portion of the ending balance totaling $28,797,000 is included with other long-term liabilities. Theatre and other closure reserves for leases that have not been terminated were recorded at the present value of the future contractual commitments for the base rents, taxes and maintenance. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized theatre and other closure expense of $951,000 and $1,600,000, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized theatre and other closure expense of $3,576,000 and  $3,911,000, respectively.

The Company sponsors frozen non contributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans generally covering all employees who, prior to the freeze, were age 21 or older and had completed at least 1,000 hours of service in their first twelve months of employment, or in a calendar year ending thereafter, and who were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company also offered eligible retirees the opportunity to participate in a health plan. Certain employees were eligible for subsidized postretirement medical benefits.

NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The Company, in the normal course of business, is a party to various ordinary course claims from vendors (including food and beverage suppliers and film distributors), landlords, competitors, and other legal proceedings. If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. 

On May 28, 2015, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice in connection with an investigation under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Beginning in May of 2015, the Company also received CIDs from the Attorneys General for the States of Ohio, Texas, Washington, Florida, New York, Kansas, and from the District of Columbia, regarding similar inquiries under those states  antitrust laws. The CIDs request the production of documents and answers to interrogatories concerning potentially anticompetitive conduct, including film clearances and participation in certain joint ventures. The Company may receive additional CIDs from antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company does not believe it has violated federal or state antitrust laws and is cooperating with the relevant governmental authorities. However, the Company cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.

NOTE 11 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016 02, Leases, which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016 02 will have on its results of operations and cash flows and believes that the significance of its future minimum rental payments will result in a material increase in assets and liabilities. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014 09 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of ASU 2014 09 by one year. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. Companies may elect to adopt this application as of the original effective date for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014 09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and has not yet selected a transition method. 

NOTE 12 EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the effects of unvested RSU s with a service condition only and unvested contingently issuable RSUs and PSUs that have service and performance conditions, if dilutive. 

21 

Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: 

Vested RSUs and PSU s have dividend rights identical to the Company s Class A and Class B common stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. Certain unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs are subject to performance conditions and are included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the Company s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ( Plan ) if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 unvested PSU s of 100,096 at the minimum performance target were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share since the shares would not be issuable under the terms of the Plan, if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.

Overview 

AMC is one of the world s largest theatrical exhibition companies and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. We operate productive theatres in the country s top markets, including No. 1 or No.2 market share in the top three markets, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. 

Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theatre food and beverage sales. The balance of our revenues are generated from ancillary sources, including on-screen advertising, fees earned from our AMC Stubs  customer frequency membership program, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, on-line ticketing fees and arcade games located in theatre lobbies. As of September 30, 2016, we owned, operated or had interests in 388 theatres and 5,295 screens. 

Film Content 

Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license  first-run  films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable admissions revenues and estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. Licenses that we enter into typically state that rental fees are based on aggregate terms established prior to the opening of the picture. In certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement upon the conclusion of the picture. Under an aggregate terms formula, we pay the distributor a specified percentage of box office gross or pay based on a scale of percentages tied to different amounts of box office gross. The settlement process allows for negotiation based upon how a film actually performs. 

During the 2015 calendar year, films licensed from our seven largest distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 89% of our U.S. admissions revenues. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor s films in any given year. 

Our revenues are dependent upon the timing and popularity of film releases by distributors. The most marketable films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. 

Open Road Releasing, LLC (  Open Road Releasing  ), operator of Open Road Films, LLC (  Open Road Films  ), our joint venture with another major exhibitor, is similarly undertaking an effort to grow our sources of content and provide access to our screens for content that may not otherwise find its way there. Open Road Film s 2015 release   Spotlight   won the Academy Award for Best Picture. 

Fathom Events (  Fathom  ) is another joint venture with several major exhibitors and is the recognized leader in the alternative entertainment industry, offering a variety of one-of-a-kind entertainment events in movie theaters nationwide that include live, high-definition performances of the Metropolitan Opera, the performing arts, major sporting events, music concerts, comedy series, Broadway shows, original programming featuring entertainment s biggest stars, socially relevant documentaries with audience Q A and much more. We are working with Fathom to further broaden our programming options to appeal to even wider audiences. 

AMC Movie Screens 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we opened 12 new screens, acquired 26 screens, permanently closed 38 screens, temporarily closed 500 screens and reopened 369 screens to implement our strategy and install consumer experience upgrades.

As of September 30, 2016, we had 2,579 3D enabled screens, including IMAX and AMC Proprietary Premium Large Format ( PLF ) screens; approximately 49% of our screens were 3D enabled screens, including IMAX 3D enabled screens, and approximately 3% of our screens were IMAX 3D enabled screens. 

IMAX     .    IMAX is one of the world s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as such, IMAX s theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world. 

As of September 30, 2016, AMC is the largest IMAX exhibitor in the U.S. with a 44% market share, and each of our IMAX local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity. As of September 30, 2016, our IMAX screen count is 73% greater than our closest competitor. AMC believes that we have had considerable success with our IMAX partnership, and in June 2016 we announced an agreement to expand the number of IMAX screens in our U.S. theatres to 185 by the end of 2019. 

Dolby Cinema  at AMC.      In May 2015, we partnered with Dolby Laboratories, Inc. to unveil a premium cinema offering for moviegoers that combined state-of-the-art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema at AMC includes Dolby Vision  laser projection and object oriented Dolby Atmos      audio technology, as well as AMC s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen. 

As of September 30, 2016, we have 26 fully operational Dolby Cinema at AMC screens.  In August 2016 we announced the acceleration of our Dolby Cinema at AMC deployment. We expect to have 50 Dolby Cinema at AMC auditoriums operational by the end of 2016, and double that number, to 100, operational by the end of 2017, seven years ahead of our original deployment plan. 

AMC Proprietary PLF.    AMC believes there is considerable opportunity to add a private label PLF format in many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. This PLF format will give AMC the capability to add a screen in theatres already outfitted with IMAX and/or Dolby Cinema at AMC. Also, this PLF should offer an enhanced theatrical experience for movie goers beyond AMC s current core theatres, but may not carry the same price premium as IMAX or Dolby Cinema at AMC. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price sensitive markets. 

Guest Amenities 

We continually upgrade the quality of our theatre circuit through substantial renovations featuring our seating concepts, acquisitions, new builds (including expansions), expansion of food and beverage offerings (including dine-in theatres), and by disposing of older screens through closures and sales. We are an industry leader in the development and operation of theatres. Typically, our theatres have 12 or more screens and offer amenities to enhance the movie-going experience, such as stadium seating providing unobstructed viewing, digital sound and premium seat design. 

Recliner seating   is the key feature of theatre renovations.  We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These renovations, in conjunction with capital contributions from our landlords, involve stripping theatres to their basic structure in order to replace finishes throughout, upgrade the sight and sound experience, install modernized points of sale and, most importantly, replace traditional theatre seats with plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the

push of a button. The renovation process typically involves losing up to two-thirds of a given auditorium s seating capacity. For an industry historically focused on quantity, this reduction in seating capacity could be viewed as counter-intuitive and harmful to revenues. However, the quality improvement in the customer experience is driving a 53% increase in attendance at these locations in their first year post renovation. Our customers have responded favorably to the significant personal space gains from ample row depths, ability to recline or stretch their legs, extra-wide pillowed chaise and oversized armrests. The reseated theatres attract more midweek audiences than normal theatres and tend to draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teens or young children. We typically do not change ticket prices in the first year after construction, however, in subsequent years we typically increase our ticket prices at our reseated theatres by amounts well in excess of price adjustments for our non-renovated theatres. 

As of September 30, 2016, we now feature recliner seating in approximately 133 theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 1,753 screens. By the end of 2016, we expect to convert an additional 500 screens to recliner seating with an additional 750 by the end of 2017. 

Rebalancing of the new supply-demand relationship created by recliner seating presents us two further opportunities to improve customer convenience and maximize operating results: open-source internet ticketing and reserved seating. 

Open-source internet ticketing   makes all our seats (over 829,000) in all our theatres and auditoriums for all our showtimes as available as possible, on as many websites as possible. This is a significant departure from the years prior to 2012, when tickets to any one of our theatres were only available on one website. We most recently deployed new technology by partnering with Atom Tickets to allow guests to utilize Atom s mobile movie ticketing platform to purchase our tickets. Atom s technology allows movie-goers to check movie reviews and AMC show times, coordinate movie outings among friends while allowing them to pay separately, and pre-pay for food and beverage items. Our tickets are currently on sale over the internet, directly or through mobile apps, at our own website and app and Fandango, Movietickets.com, Flixster and Atom Tickets. We believe increased online access is important because it captures customers  purchase intent more immediately and directly than if we wait for their arrival at the theatre box office to make a purchase. Carefully monitoring internet pre-sales also lets us adjust capacity in real time, moving movies that are poised to over perform to larger capacity auditoriums or more additional auditoriums, thereby maximizing yield. 

Reserved seating,   at some of our busiest theatres, and now available at all of our Manhattan, New York City locations, allows our customers to choose a specific seat in advance of the movie. We believe that knowing there is a specifically chosen seat waiting for a show that promises to be a sellout is comforting to our customers, reduces anxiety around the experience and compels ticket purchases. We believe reserved seating will become increasingly prevalent to the point of being a prerequisite in the medium-term future. 

We believe the comfort and personal space gains from recliner seating, coupled with the immediacy of demand captured from open-source internet ticketing and the appeal of reserved seating make a powerful economic combination for us. 

Food and beverage   sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. Food and beverage items traditionally include popcorn, soft drinks, candy and hot dogs. Different varieties of food and beverage items are offered at our theatres based on preferences in the particular geographic region. Our traditional food and beverage strategy emphasizes prominent and appealing food and beverage offerings designed for rapid service and efficiency, including a customer friendly self-serve experience. We design our theatres to have more food and beverage capacity to make it easier to serve larger numbers of customers. Strategic placement of large food and beverage operations within theatres increases their visibility, aids in reducing the length of lines, allows flexibility to introduce new concepts and improves traffic flow around the food and beverage stands. 

To address recent consumer trends, we are expanding our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include made-to-order drinks and meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to invest across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from the theatre landlord. We currently operate 19 Dine-In Theatres that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast casual eating experience.

Coca Cola Freestyle      puts customers in charge with over 140 drink flavor options in a compact footprint. Our operational excellence and history of innovation rewarded us with first-mover advantage on this new technology, which, as of September 30, 2016, was deployed in 361 of our theatres. We anticipate completing the rollout of Coca Cola Freestyle      into all of our theatres by the end of 2016, a year earlier than originally anticipated. 

AMC Stubs    

AMC Stubs      is a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. In July 2016, we completed a national relaunch of our AMC Stubs loyalty program featuring both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere      and a new non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider     . Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. The AMC Stubs Insider tier rewards guests for simply coming to the movies, and benefits include free refills on certain food items, discount ticket offers, a birthday gift and 20 reward points earned for every dollar spent. For a $15 annual membership fee, AMC Stubs Premiere members enjoy express service with specially marked shorter lines at the box office and concession stand, free size upgrades on certain food and beverage items, discount ticket offers, a birthday gift, discounted online ticketing fees and 100 points for every dollar spent. Some of the rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. Once an AMC Stubs Premere or AMC Stubs Insider member accumulates 5,000 points they will earn a $5 virtual reward. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had 4,144,000 active member households in the AMC Stubs program. Our AMC Stubs members represented approximately 22% of our attendance during 2016 with an average ticket price 3% lower than our non-members and food and beverage expenditures per patron 4% higher than non-members. We expect the number of active member households to reach 4,500,000 by the end of 2016. We believe movie-goers want to be recognized and rewarded for attending our theatres and as a result, our new AMC Stubs program is designed to strengthen guest loyalty, attract new guests and drive additional return visits. Our much larger database of identified moviegoers also provides us with additional insight into our customers  movie preferences, and this enables us to have both a larger and a more targeted marketing effort to support our Hollywood studio partners. 

The portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. 

Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. Points are forfeited upon expiration and recognized as admissions or food and beverage revenues. For the paid tier of the program (AMC Stubs Premiere), the program s annual membership fee is deferred, net of estimated refunds, and is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.

Carmike Cinemas.    On July 24, 2016, we, Congress Merger Subsidiary, Inc., our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and Carmike entered into an amended and restated merger agreement, which amends and restates that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 3, 2016, and pursuant to which we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Carmike for either $33.06 in cash or 1.0819 shares of Class A common stock, at the election of the Carmike stockholders, and subject to a customary proration mechanism to achieve an aggregate consideration mix of 70% cash and 30% in shares of our Class A common stock.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing the debt financing on favorable terms as it involves matters outside of our control. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by Carmike s shareholders. Carmike is a U.S. leader in digital cinema, 3D cinema deployments and alternative programming and is one of the nation s largest motion picture exhibitors.

Starplex Cinemas operates 33 theatres with 346 screens in small and mid-size markets in 12 states, which further complements our large market portfolio. We expect to realize synergies and cost savings related to this acquisition as a result of purchasing and procurement economies of scale and general and administrative expense savings, particularly with respect to the consolidation of corporate related functions and elimination of redundancies. In January 2016, we divested of two Starplex Cinemas theatres with 22 screens, as required by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. We received proceeds from the divestiture of approximately $5,390,000. For additional information about the Starplex Cinemas acquisition, see Note 2 Acquisition to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. 

Corporate Borrowings.    On December 11, 2015, AMCE entered into a first amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013 ( First Amendment ). The First Amendment provides for the incurrence of $125,000,000 incremental term loans ( Incremental Term Loan ). In addition, the First Amendment, among other things, (a) extends the maturity date with respect to (i) the existing Term Loan due 2020 and the Incremental Term Loan (together  Term Loan due 2022 ) to December 15, 2022 and (ii) the Revolving Credit Facility from April 30, 2018 to December 15, 2020 and (b) increases the applicable margin for the Term Loan due 2022 from 1.75% with respect to base rate borrowings to 2.25% and 2.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings to 3.25%.

Notes due 2025  .  On June 5, 2015, AMCE issued $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Notes due 2025 in a private offering. Holdings capitalized deferred financing costs of approximately $11,378,000, related to the issuance of the Notes due 2025. The Notes due 2025 mature on June 15, 2025. Holdings will pay interest on the Notes due 2025 at 5.75% per annum, semi-annually in arrears on June 15th and December 15th, commencing on December 15, 2015. Holdings may redeem some or all of the Notes due 2025 at any time on or after June 15, 2020 at 102.875% of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100% of the principal amount thereof on or after June 15, 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Prior to June 15, 2020, Holdings may redeem the Notes due 2025 at par plus a make-whole premium.

On November 8, 2016, we amended our Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013, as previously amended, to, among other things, lower the interest rate from LIBOR plus 3.25% to LIBOR plus 2.75% and to remove a 0.75% LIBOR rate floor, and borrowed $500,000,000 of New Term Loans at LIBOR plus 2.75%.

Adjusted EBITDA 

We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to include any cash distributions of earnings from our equity method investees. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $35,435,000 or 32.5% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to increases in attendance including the benefit of the Starplex acquisition and average ticket prices, increases in food and beverage revenues per patron, increases in other revenues, and partially offset by decreases in cash distributions from non-consolidated entities and increases in start-up costs, changes in reward structure and build-up of deferred revenues for earned rewards related to the relaunch of AMC Stubs which will result in future revenue when the rewards are redeemed and recognized as revenues. 

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $38,024,000 or 9.9% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to increases in attendance including the benefit of the Starplex acquisition, food and beverage revenues per patron, increases in other revenues,  offset by decreases in cash distributions from non-consolidated entities, increases in G A other: including expense due to the prior year postretirement curtailment gain of $18,118,000 and declines in average ticket prices.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides management and investors with additional information to measure our performance and estimate our value. 

Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: 

does not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;     

does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;     

does not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;     

excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and     

does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future.     

Results of Operations      For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 

Revenues.    Total revenues increased 13.2%, or $90,931,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Admissions revenues increased 12.6%, or $55,467,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a 9.7%  increase in attendance and a 2.6%  increase in average ticket price. The increase in attendance was primarily due to the increased performance of film product during the current period, and including the acquisition of Starplex Cinemas in December of 2015 and our comfort and convenience theatre renovation initiatives. The increase in average ticket price is due to a combination of factors, including the anniversary of certain promotional pricing strategies implemented in last year s third quarter, partially offset by the addition of Starplex theatres with a lower average ticket price and an increase in premium format box office attendance primarily related to Dolby Cinema   at AMC where we added seven screens in the third quarter. Total admissions revenues were increased by rewards redeemed, net of deferrals, of $474,000 and $851,000 related to rewards accumulated under AMC Stubs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our consolidated revenues are primarily collected in cash, principally through box office admissions and food and beverage sales. We have an operating  float  which partially finances our operations and which generally permits us to maintain a smaller amount of working capital capacity. This float exists because admissions revenues are received in cash, while exhibition costs (primarily film rentals) are ordinarily paid to distributors from 20 to 45 days following receipt of box office admissions revenues. Film distributors generally release the films which they anticipate will be the most successful during the summer and year-end holiday seasons. Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during such periods. 

We had working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $(399,530,000) and  $(297,787,000), respectively. Working capital included $162,737,000 and  $221,679,000 of deferred revenues and income as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We have the ability to borrow under our Senior Secured Credit Facility to meet obligations as they come due (subject to limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness in our various debt instruments). As of September 30, 2016, we had $117,389,000 available for borrowing, net of letters of credit, under our revolving Senior Secured Credit Facility. 

We believe that cash obtained from recent financing, generated from operations and existing cash and equivalents and  float  will be sufficient to fund operations, pay dividends and make planned capital expenditures currently and for at least the next 12 months, enable us complete the planned acquisitions and enable us to maintain compliance with covenants related to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Notes due 2022, the Notes due 2025, the Dollar Notes due 2026 and the Sterling Notes due 2024. 

As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Notes due 2022, and the Notes due 2025. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Cash flows provided by operating activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were $211,334,000 and $209,225,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in payments for working capital items partially offset by an increase in landlord contributions.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Cash flows used in investing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were $248,285,000 and $217,086,000, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Cash outflows from investing activities include capital expenditures of $256,599,000 and $215,574,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Our capital expenditures primarily consisted of strategic growth initiatives and remodels, capital improvements to existing locations in our theatre circuit, and technology upgrades. We expect that our gross cash outflows for capital expenditures will be approximately $400,000,000 to $420,000,000 for 2016, before giving effect to expected landlord contributions of approximately $120,000,000 to $130,000,000, resulting in a net cash outlay of approximately $280,000,000 to $300,000,000. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we received proceeds from the sale of our shares in RealD Inc. of $13,451,000 and proceeds from the sale of two Starplex divestiture theatres of $5,390,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we made capital contributions to Open Road Films of $10,000,000. 

We fund the costs of constructing, maintaining and remodeling our theatres through existing cash balances; cash generated from operations, landlord contributions, or borrowed funds, as necessary. We generally lease our theatres pursuant to long-term non-cancelable operating leases which may require the developer, who owns the property, to reimburse us for the construction costs. We may decide to own the real estate assets of new theatres and, following construction, sell and leaseback the real estate assets pursuant to long-term non-cancelable operating leases. See Commitments and Contingencies below for additional discussion of the potential cash outflows due to our proposed acquisition activity and future sources of liquidity. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash flows used in financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were $127,877,000 and $112,085,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Financing activities for the current period consisted of dividend payments and repayments of $55,000,000 related to our revolving Senior Secured Credit Facility and capital and financing lease obligations. On February 25, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, payable on March 21, 2016 to stockholders of record on March 7, 2016. On April 27, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, payable on June 20, 2016 to stockholders of record on June 6, 2016. On July 25, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, payable on September 19, 2016 to stockholders of record on September 6, 2016. We paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $59,081,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $59,012,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

On June 5, 2015, we issued $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Notes due 2025 and used the net proceeds to pay for the tender offer for the Notes due 2020, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and related transaction fees and expenses. The deferred financing costs paid related to the issuance of the Notes due 2025 were $11,378,000, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We repaid principal and recorded premium related to approximately 96.9% of the Notes due 2020 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $626,114,000, comprised of $581,324,000 principal amount and $44,790,000 recorded premium. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I for further information. 

Investment in NCM LLC 

We hold an investment of 17.4% in NCM LLC and 200,000 shares of NCM, Inc. accounted for under the equity method as of September 30, 2016. The estimated fair market value of our investment in NCM and NCM, Inc. was approximately $354,207,000, based upon the publically quoted price per share of NCM, Inc. on September 30, 2016 of $14.72 per share. We have little tax basis in these units, therefore the sale of all these units at September 30, 2016 would require us to report taxable income of approximately $428,505,000, including distributions received from NCM LLC that were previously deferred. Our investment in NCM LLC is a source of liquidity for us and we expect that any sales we may make of NCM LLC units would be made in such a manner to most efficiently manage any related tax liability. We have available net operating loss carryforwards which could reduce any related tax liability.

On July 24, 2016, we, Congress Merger Subsidiary, Inc., our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and Carmike entered into an amended and restated merger agreement, which amends and restates that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 3, 2016, and pursuant to which we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Carmike for either $33.06 in cash or 1.0819 shares of Class A common stock, at the election of the Carmike stockholders, and subject to a customary proration mechanism to achieve an aggregate consideration mix of 70% cash and 30% in shares of our Class A common stock. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by Carmike s shareholders. 

On July 12, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the equity of Odeon from private equity firm Terra Firma for a total consideration of (i) cash in the amount of GBP  375.0 million ($460.8 million), (ii) shares of AMC Class A common stock valued at GBP  125.0 million ($153.6 million) and (iii) the repayment of indebtedness of approximately GBP  478.6 million ($588.1 million) as of October 19, 2016. The US Dollar amounts set forth in the preceding sentence assume a Euro/USD exchange rate of 1.0973 and a GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.2289 as of October 19, 2016. Odeon is a leading European cinema operator with 242 cinemas and 2,236 screens. Odeon operates in four major markets: the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany; and three smaller markets: Austria, Portugal, and Ireland. The closing of the acquisition is subject to clearance by the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 11 New Accounting Pronouncements of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I for further information regarding recently issued accounting standards. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

We are exposed to various market risks. 

Market risk on variable rate financial instruments.    At September 30, 2016, we maintained a Senior Secured Credit Facility comprised of a $150,000,000 revolving credit facility and $900,000,000 of Senior Secured Term Loans due 2022. The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for borrowings at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either a base rate or LIBOR, with a minimum base rate of 1.75% and a minimum rate for LIBOR borrowings of 0.75%. The rate in effect at September 30, 2016 for the outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan due 2022 was a LIBOR-based rate of 4.00% per annum. Increases in market interest rates would cause interest expense to increase and earnings before income taxes to decrease. The change in interest expense and earnings before income taxes would be dependent upon the weighted average outstanding borrowings during the reporting period following an increase in market interest rates. At September 30, 2016, we had $20,000,000 variable-rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and had an aggregate principal balance of $874,020,000 outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2022. A 100 basis point change in market interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense on the Senior Secured Credit Facility by $6,723,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Market risk on fixed rate financial instruments.    Included in long-term corporate borrowings at September 30, 2016 were principal amounts of $600,000,000 of our Notes due 2025 and $375,000,000 of our Notes due 2022. Increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decrease in the fair value of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2022 and a decrease in market interest rates would generally cause an increase in fair value of the Notes due 2025 and Notes due 2022. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   

(a)  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

55 

Table of Contents  

The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

(b)  Changes in internal controls. 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent calendar quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings   

Reference is made to Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10 Q for information on certain litigation to which we are a party. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors   

Reference is made to Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and current report on Form 8-K filed October 24, 2016. Apart from the information in the above referenced Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

There may be future dilution of AMC Class A common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of AMC Class A common stock. 

AMC is not restricted from issuing additional shares of AMC Class A common stock. In the future, AMC may issue shares of AMC Class A common stock to raise cash to refinance indebtedness or for working capital, future activities, acquisitions or other purposes. AMC may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and shares of AMC Class A common stock or just shares of AMC Class A common stock. In fact, AMC has agreed to issue shares of AMC Class A common stock as part of the consideration delivered in connection with its acquisitions of Odeon and Carmike. AMC may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of AMC Class A common stock. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of current AMC stockholders in AMC, reduce AMC's earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of shares of AMC Class A common stock. 

Sales of a substantial amount of shares of AMC Class A common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of shares of AMC Class A common stock. 

Sales of a substantial amount of shares of AMC Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of shares of AMC Class A common stock. Because the receipt of the merger consideration in AMC s acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, Inc. will be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a large number of Carmike stockholders may choose to sell the shares of AMC Class A common stock they receive promptly following the merger. A large number of shares of AMC Class A common stock may be sold in the public market as a result of its acquisition of Odeon. As part of this transaction, AMC has agreed to issue to the seller of Odeon AMC Class A common stock with a value of GBP  125.0 million. AMC has also agreed to file a registration statement registering the shares of AMC Class A common stock issued in connection with its purchase of Odeon within 60 days of the closing of the Odeon transaction. While the Odeon seller has agreed to certain six-month and one-year lockup periods following consummation of the transaction, a large number of shares of AMC Class A common stock could be sold promptly upon the expiration of such lock-up periods. Such sales could reduce the market price of shares of AMC Class A common stock. 

Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement dated December 23, 2013 by and among AMC and Wanda, AMC has agreed to use its best efforts to effect registered offerings upon request from Wanda and to grant incidental or "piggyback" registration rights with respect to any registrable securities held by Wanda. The obligation to effect any demand for registration by Wanda will be subject to certain conditions, including limitations on the number of demand registrations and limitations on the minimum value of securities to be registered. 

Following consummation of the acquisition of Odeon, AMC has agreed to use its best efforts to grant certain incidental or "piggyback" registration rights with respect to securities issued in connection with the Odeon transaction.  

The exercise of such registration rights by Wanda and/or the seller of Odeon may substantially increase the amount of shares of AMC Class A common stock in the public market and could reduce the market price of shares of AMC Class A common stock.

Table of Contents  

We are subject to complex taxation, changes in tax rates, adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and disagreements with tax authorities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We are subject to many different forms of taxation in both the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Current economic and political conditions, including the recent United Kingdom (U.K.) referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., make tax rates and policy in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., U.K. and E.U., subject to significant change. Recent examples include the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s ( OECD ) recommendations on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ( BEPS ), the European Comission s Anti-Tax Avoidance Package, and the U.S. Treasury issuance of proposed SS 385 regulation (debt characterization as equity). The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. 

We may be reviewed by antitrust authorities in connection with acquisition opportunities that would increase 

our number of theatres in markets where we have a leading market share. 

Given our size and market share, pursuit of acquisition opportunities that would increase the number of our theatres in markets where we have a leading market share would likely result in significant review by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and States  Attorneys General, and we may be required to dispose of theatres in order to complete such acquisition opportunities. For example, in connection with the acquisition of Kerasotes, we were required to dispose of 11 theatres located in various markets across the United States, including Chicago, Denver and Indianapolis and in connection with the acquisition of Starplex Cinemas, we were required to dispose of 2 theatres in 2 markets. In addition, our pending acquisitions of Odeon and UCI Cinema Holdings Limited and Carmike Cinemas, Inc. are currently under review by the relevant antitrust authorities. As a result, we may not be able to succeed in acquiring other exhibition companies or we may have to dispose of a significant number of theatres in key markets in order to complete such acquisitions.

The amount of the Participant Deferral Credit shall be credited by the Employer to the Deferred Compensation Account maintained for the Participant pursuant to Section 8.  The following special provisions shall apply with respect to the Participant Deferral Credits of a Participant:

			 The Employer shall credit to the Participant s Deferred Compensation Account, as soon as administratively practicable following the date such amount is withheld for credit to this Plan, an amount equal to the total Participant Deferral Credit for the period ending on such Crediting Date.

			 An election pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be made by the Participant by executing and delivering a Participant Deferral Agreement to the Committee. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.1, the Participant Deferral Agreement shall become effective with respect to such Participant as of the first day of January following the date such Participant Deferral Agreement is received by the Committee.

			 In the case of the first year in which the Participant becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, the Participant may execute and deliver a Participant Deferral Agreement to the Committee within 30 days after the date the Participant enters the Plan to be effective as of the first payroll period next following the date the Participant Deferral Agreement is received by the Committee.  For Compensation that is earned based upon a specified performance period (for example, an annual bonus), where a deferral election is made in the first year of eligibility but after the beginning of the service period, the election will be deemed to apply to Compensation paid for services subsequent to the election if the election applies to the portion of the Compensation equal to the total amount of the Compensation for the service period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the election over the total number of days in the performance period.     

4.1.4 
			 A Participant may unilaterally modify a Participant Deferral Agreement (either to terminate, increase or decrease the portion of his future Compensation which is subject to deferral) by providing a written modification of the Participant Deferral Agreement to the Employer. The modification shall become effective as of the first day of January following the date such written modification is received by the Committee.     

4.1.5 
			 If the Participant performed services continuously from a date no later than the date upon which the performance criteria are established through a date no earlier than the date upon which the Participant makes an initial deferral election, a Participant Deferral Agreement relating to the deferral of Performance Based Compensation may be executed and      

delivered to the Committee no later than the date which is 6 months prior to the end of the performance period, provided that in no event may an election to defer Performance Based Compensation be made after such Compensation has become both substantially certain to be paid and readily ascertainable.     

4.1.6 
			 If the Employer has a fiscal year other than the calendar year, Compensation relating to service in the fiscal year of the Employer (such as a bonus based on the fiscal year of the Employer), of which no amount is paid or payable during the fiscal year, may be deferred at the Participant s election only if the election to defer is made not later than the close of the Employer s fiscal year next preceding the first fiscal year in which the Participant performs any services for which such Compensation is payable.     

4.1.7 
			 Compensation payable after the last day of the Participant s taxable year solely for services provided during the final payroll period containing the last day of the Participant s taxable year (i.e., December 31) is treated for purposes of this Section 4.1 as Compensation for services performed in the subsequent taxable year.     

4.1.8 
			 The Committee may from time to time establish policies or rules consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to govern the manner in which Participant Deferral Credits may be made.  If a Participant becomes Disabled or applies for and is eligible for a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency during a Plan Year, the Participant s deferral election for such Plan Year shall be cancelled no later than the date permitted under Section 409A.     

4.2  Deferred Compensation Account      .  All Participant Deferral Credits will be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account of the Participant as provided in Section 8.  

4.3  Employer Contribution Credits  .    Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, for any Plan Year, the Employer may elect to credit to the Employer Contribution Account of each Participant, or any Participant designated by the Employer, an amount as determined by the Employer.  Any such Employer Contribution Credit shall be made entirely at the discretion of the Employer and the amount of such Employer Contribution Credit, if any, may be different for different Participants.  

Section 5.      
			             Qualifying Distribution Events:     

5.1  Separation from Service        .    If the Participant Separates from Service with the Employer, the balance in the Accounts shall be paid to the Participant by the Employer as provided in Section 6.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made earlier than six months after the date of Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of death) with respect to a Participant who is a Specified Employee. Any payments to which a Specified Employee would be entitled during the first six months following the date of Separation from Service shall be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the date of Separation from Service.  

5.2  Disability      .  If the Participant becomes Disabled while in Service, the balance in the Accounts shall be paid to the Participant by the Employer as provided in Section 6.  

5.3  Death      .  If the Participant dies while in Service, the Employer shall pay a benefit to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum equal to the balance in the Participant s Accounts as of the date of death.  Payment of such benefit shall be made by the Employer as provided in Section 6.  If a Participant dies following his Separation from Service for any reason, and before all payments under the Plan have been made, the balance in the Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid by the Employer to the Participant s Beneficiary in a single lump sum.  

5.4  In Service Distributions       .  A Participant may designate in the Participant Deferral Agreement to have a specified amount of his Participant Deferral Credits credited to the Participant s In Service Account for in service distribution in a lump sum payment at the date specified by the Participant.  In no event may an in service distribution be made prior to two years following the establishment of the In Service Account of the Participant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant incurs a Qualifying Distribution Event prior to the date on which the entire balance in the In Service Account has been distributed, then the balance in the In Service Account on the date of the Qualifying Distribution Event shall be distributed to the Participant in the same manner and at the same time as the balance in the Deferred Compensation Account is distributed under Section 6 and in accordance with the rules and elections in effect under Section 6.  

5.5  Education Distributions      .  A Participant may designate in the Participant Deferral Agreement to have a specified amount of his Participant Deferral Credits credited to the Participant s Education Account for education distributions on the date or dates specified by the Participant.  If the Participant designates more than one Student, the Education Account will be divided into a separate Education Account for each Student, and the Participant may designate in the Participant Deferral Agreement the percentage or dollar amount to be credited to each Education Account.  In the absence of a clear designation, all credits made to the Education Account shall be equally allocated to each Education Account.  The Employer shall pay to the Participant the balance in the Education Account with respect to the Student at the time and in the manner designated by the Participant in the Participant Deferral Agreement.  If the Participant elects to receive education distributions in annual installment payments (over four to six years), the payment of each annual installment shall be made on the anniversary of the date of the first installment payment, and the amount of the annual installment shall be adjusted on such anniversary for credits or debits to the Participant s Education Account pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan.  Such adjustment shall be made by dividing the balance in the Education Account on such date by the number of annual installments remaining to be paid hereunder; provided that the last annual installment due under the Plan shall be the entire amount credited to the Participant s Education Account on the date of payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant incurs a Qualifying Distribution Event prior to the date on which the entire balance of the Education Account has been distributed, then the balance in the Education Account on the date of the Qualifying Distribution Event shall be distributed to the Participant in the same manner and at the same time as his or her remaining Deferred Compensation Account is distributed under Section 6 and in accordance with the rules and elections in effect under Section 6.  

5.6  Unforeseeable Emergency      .  A distribution from the Deferred Compensation Account may be made to a Participant in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, subject to the following provisions:  

5.6.1  A Participant may, at any time prior to his Separation from Service for any reason, make application to the Committee to receive a distribution in a lump sum of all or a portion of the vested balance in the Deferred Compensation Account (determined as of the date the distribution, if any, is made under this Section 5.6) because of an Unforeseeable Emergency.  A distribution because of an Unforeseeable Emergency shall not exceed the amount required to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such distribution, after taking into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by stopping current deferrals to the Plan under Section 4.1. 

5.6.2  The Participant s request for a distribution on account of Unforeseeable Emergency must be made in writing to the Committee.  The request must specify the nature of the financial hardship, the total amount requested to be distributed from the Deferred Compensation Account, and the total amount of the actual expense incurred or to be incurred on account of the Unforeseeable Emergency. 

5.6.3  If a distribution under this Section 5.6 is approved by the Committee, such distribution will be made as soon as practicable following the date it is approved.  The processing of the request shall be completed as soon as practicable from the date on which the Committee receives the properly completed written request for a distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency.  If a Participant s Separation from Service occurs after a request is approved in accordance with this Section 5.6.3, but prior to distribution of the full amount approved, the approval of the request shall be automatically null and void and the benefits which the Participant is entitled to receive under the Plan shall be distributed in accordance with the applicable distribution provisions of the Plan. 

5.6.4  The Committee may from time to time adopt additional policies or rules consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to govern the manner in which such distributions may be made so that the Plan may be conveniently administered. 

Section 6.      
			             Qualifying Distribution Events Payment Options:     

6.1  Payment Options        .    The Participant shall elect in the Participant Deferral Agreement the method under which his or her Deferred Compensation Account (not including    

amounts credited to an Education Account or In-Service Account) will be distributed.  Payment may be made in either a lump sum payment or equal annual installments over a term not to exceed ten (10) years and shall commence upon the date of the Qualifying Distribution Event.  The Participant may elect a different method of payment for each Qualifying Distribution Event.  If the Participant elects the installment payment option, the payment of each annual installment shall be made on the anniversary of the date of the first installment payment, and the amount of the annual installment shall be adjusted on such anniversary for credits or debits to the Participant s account pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan.  Such adjustment shall be made by dividing the balance in the Deferred Compensation Account on such date by the number of annual installments remaining to be paid hereunder; provided that the last annual installment due under the Plan shall be the entire amount credited to the Participant s account on the date of payment.  In the event the Participant fails to make a valid election of the payment method, the distribution will be made in a single lump sum payment upon the Qualifying Distribution Event.  

The Participant s Employer Contribution Account, if any, shall be paid in a single lump sum upon the earlier of:  the Participant s Disability; or the Participant s Separation from Service.  A payment shall be treated as made upon the date of the Qualifying Distribution Event if it is made on such date or a later date within the same calendar year or, if later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the Qualifying Distribution Event.  A payment may be further delayed to the extent permitted in accordance with regulations and guidance under Section 409A of the Code. 

6.2  De Minimis Amounts      .  Notwithstanding any payment election made by the Participant, the balance in the Accounts of the Participant will be distributed in a single lump sum payment if the payment accompanies the termination of the Participant s entire interest in the Plan and the amount of such payment does not exceed the limit set forth in Section 402(g)(1)(b) of the Code from time to time as in effect.  Such payment shall be made on or before the later of (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant Separates from Service from the Employer, or (ii) the date that is 2 1/2 months after the Participant Separates from Service from the Employer.  

6.3  Subsequent Elections      .  With the consent of the Committee, a Participant may delay or change the method of payment of the Deferred Compensation Account subject to the following requirements:  

6.3.1  The new election may not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the new election is made. 

6.3.2  If the new election relates to a payment for a Qualifying Distribution Event other than the death of the Participant, the Participant becoming Disabled, or an Unforeseeable Emergency, the new election must provide for the deferral of the first payment for a period of at least five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made. 

6.3.3  If the new election relates to a payment from the In Service Account or Education Account, the new election must be made at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment from such account. 

For purposes of this Section 6.3 and Section 6.4, a payment is each separately identified amount to which the Participant is entitled under the Plan; provided, that entitlement to a series of installment payments is treated as the entitlement to a single payment. 

6.4  Acceleration Prohibited      .  The acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment due under the Plan is prohibited except as provided in regulations and administrative guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code.  It is not an acceleration of the time or schedule of payment if the Employer waives or accelerates any vesting requirements applicable to a benefit under the Plan.

The investment election of the Participant shall remain in effect until a new election is made by the Participant.  In the event the Participant fails for any reason to make an effective election of the investment return to be credited to his account, the investment return shall be determined by the Committee.  

8.3  Adjustments to Accounts      .  With respect to each Participant who has an Account under the Plan, the amount credited to such account shall be adjusted by the following debits and credits, at the times and in the order stated:

9.5  Establishment of Rules      .  Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may from time to time establish rules or by laws for the administration of the Plan and the transaction of its business.  

9.6  Conflicts of Interest      .  No individual member of the Committee shall have any right to vote or decide upon any matter relating solely to himself or to any of his rights or benefits under the Plan (except that such member may sign unanimous written consent to resolutions adopted or other action taken without a meeting), except relating to the terms of his Participant Deferral Agreement.  

9.7  Correction of Errors      .  The Committee may correct errors and, so far as practicable, may adjust any benefit or credit or payment accordingly. The Committee may in its discretion waive any notice requirements in the Plan; provided, that a waiver of notice in one or more cases shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of notice in any other case.  

9.8  Authority to Interpret Plan      .  Subject to the claims procedure set forth in Section 16, the Committee shall have the duty and discretionary authority to interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and to decide any dispute which may arise regarding the rights of Participants hereunder, including the discretionary authority to construe the Plan and to make determinations as to eligibility and benefits under the Plan.  The Committee s prior exercise of discretionary authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like manner thereafter.  Determinations by the Committee shall be binding and conclusive upon all interested persons.  

9.9  Third Party Advisors      .  The Committee may engage, and rely upon the advice and work product of, an attorney, accountant, actuary or any other technical advisor on matters regarding the operation of the Plan and to perform such other duties as shall be required in connection therewith, and may employ such clerical and related personnel as the Committee shall deem requisite or desirable in carrying out the provisions of the Plan.  

9.10  Expense Reimbursement      .  The Committee shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Employer for its reasonable expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of its duties in the administration of the Plan.  

9.11  Indemnification      .  No member of the Committee shall be personally liable by reason of any contract or other instrument executed by him or on his behalf as a member of the Committee nor for any mistake of judgment made in good faith, and the Employer shall indemnify and hold harmless, directly from its own assets (including the proceeds of any insurance policy the premiums for which are paid from the Employer s assets), each member of the Committee and each other officer, employee, or director of the Employer to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan may be delegated or allocated, against any unreimbursed or uninsured cost or expense (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the prior written approval of the Board) arising out of any act, or omission to act, in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person s own fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence.  

Section 10.      
			             Contractual Liability; Trust:     

10.1  Contractual Liability      .  The obligation of the Employer to make payments hereunder shall constitute a contractual liability of the Employer to the Participant. Such    

payments shall be made from the general funds of the Employer, and the Employer shall not be required to establish or maintain any special or separate fund, or otherwise to segregate assets to assure that such payments shall be made, and the Participant shall not have any interest in any particular assets of the Employer by reason of its obligations hereunder.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payment from the Employer, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Employer.  

10.2  Trust      .  The Employer may establish a Trust with a Trustee, pursuant to such terms and conditions as are set forth in the Trust Agreement, for the purpose of assisting in meeting its obligations hereunder.  Any Trust, if and when established, is intended to be treated as a  grantor trust  for purposes of the Code, and all assets of the Trust would be held in the United States.  The establishment of the Trust would not be intended to cause Participants to realize current income on amounts contributed thereto, and any Trust shall be so interpreted and administered.  

Section 11.      
			             Allocation of Responsibilities:     

The persons or entities responsible for the Plan and the duties and responsibilities allocated to each are as follows: 

11.1 
			 Employer          .  American Multi-Cinema, Inc., as plan sponsor, shall have exclusive the authority to:     

(i) 
			 amend the Plan;      

(ii) 
			 appoint and remove members of the Committee; and     

(iii) 
			 terminate the Plan as permitted in Section 14.     

11.2  Committee  .    The Committee shall have the authority to:         

(i) 
			 designate Participants;     

(ii) 
			 interpret the provisions of the Plan and to determine the rights of the Participants under the Plan, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 16 relating to claims procedure;     

(iii) 
			 administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, except to the extent powers to administer the Plan are specifically delegated to another person or persons as provided in the Plan;     

(iv) 
			 account for the amount credited to the Accounts of a Participant; and     

(v) 
			 direct the Employer in the payment of benefits.     

(vi) 
			 file such reports as may be required with the United States Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and any other government agency to which reports may be required to be submitted from time to time; and     

(vii) 
			 administer the claims procedure to the extent provided in Section 16.     

Section 12.      
			             Benefits Not Assignable; Facility of Payments:     

12.1  Benefits Not Assignable      .  No portion of any benefit credited or paid under the Plan with respect to any Participant shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any attempt so to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge the same shall be void, nor shall any portion of such benefit be in any manner payable to any assignee, receiver or any one trustee, or be liable for his debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan will honor a qualified domestic relations order awarding a portion of a Participant s benefit under this Plan to an alternate payee.  

12.2  Payments to Minors and Others      .  If any individual entitled to receive a payment under the Plan shall be physically, mentally or legally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of such payment, the Committee, upon the receipt of satisfactory evidence of such individual s incapacity and satisfactory evidence that another person or institution is maintaining the individual and that no guardian or committee has been appointed for him or her, may cause any payment otherwise payable to such individual to be made to such person or institution so maintaining the individual.  Payment to such person or institution shall be in full satisfaction of all claims by or through the Participant to the extent of the amount thereof.  

Section 13.      
			             Beneficiary:     

The Participant s Beneficiary shall be the person, persons or entity designated by the Participant on the Beneficiary designation form provided by and filed with the Committee or its designee.  If the Participant does not designate a Beneficiary, the Beneficiary shall be his or her Surviving Spouse.  If the Participant does not designate a Beneficiary and has no Surviving Spouse, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant s estate.  The designation of a Beneficiary may be changed or revoked only by filing a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee or its designee.  If a Beneficiary (the  primary Beneficiary ) is receiving or is entitled to receive payments under the Plan and dies before receiving all of the payments due, the balance to which the primary Beneficiary is entitled shall be paid to the contingent Beneficiary, if any, named in the Participant s current Beneficiary designation form.  If there is no contingent Beneficiary, the balance shall be paid to the estate of the primary Beneficiary.  Any Beneficiary may disclaim all or any part of any benefit to which such Beneficiary shall be entitled hereunder by filing a written disclaimer with the Committee before payment of such benefit is to be made.  Such a disclaimer shall be made in a form satisfactory to the Committee and shall be irrevocable when filed.  Any benefit disclaimed shall be payable from the Plan in the same manner as if the Beneficiary who filed the disclaimer had predeceased the Participant. 

Section 14.      
			             Amendment and Termination of Plan:     

American Multi-Cinema, Inc., as plan sponsor, may amend any provision of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time provided, that in no event shall such amendment or termination reduce the balance in any Participant s Account as of the date of such amendment or termination, nor shall any such amendment affect the terms of the Plan relating to the payment of such Account.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following special provisions shall apply: 

14.1  Termination in the Discretion of the Employer      .  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 14.2, the Plan may be terminated and benefits distributed to Participants subject to the following requirements:  

14.1.1 
			 All arrangements sponsored by the Employer that would be aggregated with the Plan under Section 1.409A 1(c) of the Treasury Regulations are terminated.     

14.1.2 
			 No payments other than payments that would be payable under the terms of the Plan if the termination had not occurred are made within 12 months of the termination date.     

14.1.3 
			 All benefits under the Plan are paid within 24 months of the termination date.     

14.1.4 
			 The Employer does not adopt a new arrangement that would be aggregated with the Plan under Section 1.409A 1(c) of the Treasury Regulations providing for the deferral of compensation at any time within five years following the date of termination of the Plan.     

14.1.5 
			 If the Employer terminates the Plan within 30 days preceding or 12 months following a  change of control  as described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code any resulting distribution to Participants shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A and regulations thereunder.     

14.2  No Financial Triggers      .  The Plan may not be terminated and distributions made to a Participant due solely to (and proximate to) a change in the financial health of the Employer.  

Section 15.      
			             Communication to Participants:     

The Employer will make a copy of the Plan available for inspection by Participants and their beneficiaries upon written request during reasonable hours at the principal office of the Employer or through other reasonable means. 

Section 16.      
			             Claims Procedure:     

The following claims procedure shall apply with respect to the Plan: 

16.1  Filing of a Claim for Benefits      .  If a Participant or Beneficiary (the  claimant ) believes that he or she is entitled to benefits under the Plan which are not being paid or which are    

not being credited for his or her benefit, the claimant shall file a written claim therefore with the Committee.  

16.2  Notification to Claimant of Decision      .  Within 90 days after receipt of a claim by the Committee (or within 180 days if special circumstances require an extension of time), the Committee will notify the claimant of the decision with regard to the claim. In the event of such special circumstances requiring an extension of time, there will be furnished to the claimant prior to expiration of the initial 90 day period written notice of the extension, which notice will set forth the special circumstances and the date by which the decision will be furnished.  If such claim is wholly or partially denied, notice thereof will be in writing and worded in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, and will set forth:  (i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (ii) specific reference to pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based; (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and (iv) an explanation of the procedure for review of the denial and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the claim relates to a Participant who is Disabled, the Committee will notify the claimant of the decision within 45 days (which may be extended for an additional 30 days if required by special circumstances).  

16.3  Procedure for Review      .  Within 60 days following receipt by the claimant of notice denying his or her claim, in whole or in part, or, if such notice shall not be given, within 60 days following the latest date on which such notice could have been timely given, the claimant may appeal denial of the claim by filing a written application for review with the Committee.  Following such request for review, the Committee will fully and fairly review the decision denying the claim.  Prior to the decision of the Committee, the claimant shall be given an opportunity to review pertinent documents and to submit issues and comments in writing.  

16.4  Decision on Review      .  The decision on review of a claim denied in whole or in part by the Committee will be made in the following manner:  

16.4.1  Within 60 days following receipt by the Committee of the request for review (or within 120 days if special circumstances require an extension of time), the Committee will notify the claimant in writing of its decision with regard to the claim.  In the event of such special circumstances requiring an extension of time, written notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the claim relates to a Participant who is Disabled, the Committee will notify the claimant of the decision within 45 days (which may be extended for an additional 45 days if required by special circumstances). 

16.4.2  With respect to a claim that is denied in whole or in part, the decision on review will (i) set forth specific reasons for the decision, (ii) will be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, (iii) will cite specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based, (iv) will contain a statement that the claimant is   

entitled to receive, upon written request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits, and (v) a statement describing any voluntary appeal procedures offered by the Plan and the claimant s right to obtain the information about such procedures, as well as a statement of the claimant s right to bring an action under ERISA section 502(a). 

16.4.3  All decisions of the Committee are final and conclusive. 

16.5  Action by Authorized Representative of Claimant      .  All actions set forth in this Section 16 to be taken by the claimant may likewise be taken by a representative of the claimant duly authorized to act in his or her behalf on such matters.  The Committee and the Committee may require such evidence as either may reasonably deem necessary or advisable of the authority to act of any such representative.  

Section 17.      
			             Miscellaneous Provisions:     

17.1  Set Off      .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan but subject to any limitations imposed under Section 409A of the Code, the Employer may reduce the amount of any payment otherwise payable to or on behalf of a Participant hereunder (net of any required withholdings) by the amount of any loan, cash advance, extension of credit or other obligation of the Participant to the Employer that is then due and payable, and the Participant shall be deemed to have consented to such reduction.  

17.2  Notices      .  Each Participant who is not in Service and each Beneficiary shall be responsible for furnishing the Committee or its designee with his current address for the mailing of notices and benefit payments. Any notice required or permitted to be given to such Participant or Beneficiary shall be deemed given if directed to such address and mailed by regular United States mail, first class, postage prepaid.  If any check mailed to such address is returned as undeliverable to the addressee, mailing of checks will be suspended until the Participant or Beneficiary furnishes the proper address.  This provision shall not be construed as requiring the mailing of any notice or notification otherwise permitted to be given by posting or by other publication.  

17.3  Lost Distributees      .  A benefit shall be deemed forfeited if the Committee is unable to locate the Participant or Beneficiary to whom payment is due on or before the fifth anniversary of the date payment is to be made or commence; provided, that the deemed investment rate of return pursuant to Section 8.2 shall cease to be applied to the Participant s account following the first anniversary of such date; provided further, however, that such benefit shall be reinstated if a valid claim is made by or on behalf of the Participant or Beneficiary for all or part of the forfeited benefit.  

17.4  Reliance on Data      .  The Employer, the Committee and the Committee shall have the right to rely on any data provided by the Participant or by any Beneficiary. Representations of such data shall be binding upon any party seeking to claim a benefit through a Participant, and    

the Employer, the Committee and the Committee shall have no obligation to inquire into the accuracy of any representation made at any time by a Participant or Beneficiary.  

17.5  Receipt and Release for Payments      .  Subject to the provisions of Section 17.1, any payment made from the Plan to or with respect to any Participant or Beneficiary, or pursuant to a disclaimer by a Beneficiary, shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the Plan and the Employer with respect to the Plan.    

17.6  Headings      .  The headings and subheadings of the Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions hereof.  

17.7  Continuation of Employment      .  The establishment of the Plan shall not be construed as conferring any legal or other rights upon any Employee or any persons for continuation of employment, nor shall it interfere with the right of the Employer to discharge any Employee or to deal with him without regard to the effect thereof under the Plan.  

17.8  Merger or Consolidation; Assumption of Plan      .  In the event the Employer consolidates or merges into or with another corporation or entity, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another corporation, partnership, trust or other entity (a  Successor Entity ), such Successor Entity may assume the rights, obligations and liabilities of the Employer under the Plan and upon such assumption, the Successor Entity shall become obligated to perform the terms and conditions of the Plan.  

17.9  Construction      .  The provisions of the Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas, except to the extent that such laws are superseded by ERISA and the applicable requirements of the Code.  

17.10  Taxes      .  The Employer or other payor may withhold a benefit payment under the Plan or a Participant s wages, or the Employer may reduce a Participant s account balance, in order to meet any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation with respect to Plan benefits, as permitted under Section 409A of the Code.  The Employer or any other payor shall report Plan payments and other Plan related information to the appropriate governmental agencies as required under applicable laws.

AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.  

Non-Employee Director Compensation Program  

Summary 

Revised November 3, 2016 

Effective January 1, 2017 

Each member of the Board of Directors (the  Board ) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ), including directors that are not independent under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission but excluding those directors that are employed by the Company, its parent company Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., or their affiliates (the  Non-Employee Directors ), will receive the following annual compensation: 

an annual cash retainer of $5,000 for service on each of the Company s Audit, Compensation, and Nominating   Corporate Governance Committees;     

an annual cash retainer of $20,000 for service as the chairman of the Company s Audit Committee; and     

an annual cash retainer of $10,000 for service as the chairman of each of the Company s Compensation, and Nominating   Corporate Governance Committees.     

Stock awards will be made pursuant to the Company s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and issued on the same date annual grants are made to members of the Company s senior management team.  Non-Employee Directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual cash retainers in stock.  The number of shares to be awarded will be determined by dividing the award value by the average closing price of the stock for the five trading days prior to the date of the stock award.  Stock awards must be retained until the earlier to occur of (i) the third anniversary of the date of grant or (ii) the departure of the Non-Employee Director from the Board.    

Cash retainers will be paid in four equal installments at the beginning of each calendar quarter. 

If a director begins service after January 1, the annual cash retainer and the annual stock award will be prorated for the partial year of service.  Cash retainers for committee service need not be pro-rated in the first year of service. 

Additionally, the Company shall reimburse the Non-Employee Directors for their reasonable out-of-pocket travel and related expenses incurred in connection with their service on the Board.
