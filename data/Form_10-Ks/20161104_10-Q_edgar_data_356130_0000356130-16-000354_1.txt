  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     EMC Insurance Group Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of Employers Mutual Casualty Company (Employers Mutual), is an insurance holding company with operations in property and casualty insurance and reinsurance.  The Company writes property and casualty insurance in both commercial and personal lines of insurance, with a focus on medium-sized commercial accounts.  The term  Company  is used interchangeably to describe EMC Insurance Group Inc. (Parent Company only) and EMC Insurance Group Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included.  The results of operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.  The consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
  In reading these financial statements, reference should be made to the Company s   2015   Form 10-K or the   2015   Annual Report to Stockholders for more detailed footnote information. 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidance related to the Consolidation Topic 810 of the Accounting Standards Codification   TM    (Codification or ASC).  The objective of this update is to improve consolidation guidance through changes in the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The guidance modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, while also eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and is to be applied either retrospectively or through a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016.  Adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial condition or operating results of the Company. 
  In March 2016, the FASB updated its guidance related to Stock Compensation Topic 718 of the ASC.  The objective of this update was to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments.  The provisions applicable to the Company primarily involve the accounting treatment for excess tax benefits, which is the excess of the actual tax benefit realized by the Company upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options (by Employers Mutual's employees) over the deferred income tax benefit previously recognized in conjunction with the compensation expense (tax deficiency if the actual tax benefit realized is less than the previously recognized deferred income tax benefit).  The FASB permitted early prospective adoption of these provisions, and the Company elected to adopt effective January 1, 2016.  As a result, effective January 1, 2016 the Company no longer records to additional paid-in capital the excess tax benefits (deficiencies) allocated to it through the pooling agreement, but instead recognizes these amounts through the consolidated statements of income as components of current and deferred income taxes.  The requirement that these excess tax benefits (deficiencies) be reflected as financing cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows was also removed, and these amounts are now reflected as cash flows from operating activities on a prospective basis.

    TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES 
     The Inter-Company Committees of the boards of directors of the Company and Employers Mutual approved a new inter-company reinsurance program between the Company's insurance subsidiaries in the property and casualty insurance segment and Employers Mutual for calendar year 2016.  This reinsurance program is intended to reduce the volatility of the Company's quarterly results caused by excessive catastrophe and storm losses, and provide protection from both the frequency and severity of such losses.  The reinsurance program consists of   two   semi-annual aggregate catastrophe excess of loss treaties.  The first treaty was effective from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, and had a retention of   $20.0 million   and a limit of   $24.0 million  .  The total cost of this treaty was approximately   $6.3 million  .  The second treaty is effective from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and has a retention of   $15.0 million   and a limit of   $12.0 million  .  The total cost of this treaty is approximately   $1.5 million  .  All catastrophe and storm losses assumed by the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries (net of applicable reinsurance recoveries from external reinsurance protections purchased by the pool participants) are subject to the terms of these treaties, and there is no co-participation provision.  Losses and settlement expenses ceded to Employers Mutual under these treaties totaled   $3.5 million   and   $5.1 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Only   $213,000   remains in the   $15.0 million   retention before recoveries will be realized under the July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 treaty. 
  The Inter-Company Committees of the boards of directors of the Company and Employers Mutual also approved a change in the inter-company reinsurance program between the Company's reinsurance subsidiary and Employers Mutual for calendar year 2016.  The reinsurance program consists of   two   treaties.  The first is a per occurrence catastrophe excess of loss treaty with a retention of   $10.0 million  , a limit of   $10.0 million  ,   20 percent   co-participation, and no reinstatement.  The total cost of this treaty is approximately   $2.0 million  .  The second is an annual aggregate catastrophe excess of loss treaty with a retention of   $20.0 million  , a limit of   $100.0 million  , and   20 percent   co-participation.  The total cost of this treaty is approximately   $3.1 million  .  Any losses recovered under the per occurrence treaty inure to the benefit of the aggregate treaty.  Only catastrophic events with total losses greater than   $500,000   are subject to the terms of the aggregate treaty.  The reinsurance subsidiary has purchased additional reinsurance protection (Industry Loss Warranties) in peak exposure territories from external parties in which coverage is triggered when losses experienced by the insurance industry from a catastrophic event exceed a specified threshold.  Any reinsurance recoveries received from external parties reduce the amount of losses ceded to Employers Mutual under the catastrophe excess of loss program.  The net cost of the external reinsurance protection will be approximately   $3.5 million   in 2016.  There were   no   recoveries under the reinsurance program during the first nine months of 2016.   

3. 
    REINSURANCE 
     The effect of reinsurance on premiums written and earned, and losses and settlement expenses incurred, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented below.  The classification of the assumed and ceded reinsurance amounts between affiliates and nonaffiliates is based on the participants in the underlying reinsurance agreements, and is intended to provide an understanding of the actual source of the reinsurance activities.  This presentation differs from the classifications used in the consolidated financial statements, where all amounts flowing through the pooling, quota share and excess of loss agreements with Employers Mutual are reported as  affiliated  balances.

For the reinsurance subsidiary, this line represents the reinsurance business assumed through the quota share agreement (including  fronting  activities initiated by Employers Mutual) and the business assumed outside the quota share agreement. 
                
     Assumed from affiliates  for the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries represents their aggregate   30 percent   pool participation percentage of all the pool members  direct business.  The amounts reported under the caption  Losses and settlement expenses incurred  also include claim-related services provided by Employers Mutual that are allocated to the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and the reinsurance subsidiary. 
                
     Ceded to nonaffiliates  for the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries represents their aggregate   30 percent   pool participation percentage of 1) the amounts ceded to nonaffiliated reinsurance companies in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreements providing protection to the pool and each of its participants, and 2) the amounts ceded on a mandatory basis to state organizations in connection with various programs.  For the reinsurance subsidiary, this line includes 1) reinsurance business that is ceded to other insurance companies in connection with  fronting  activities initiated by Employers Mutual, and 2) starting in 2016, amounts ceded to purchase Industry Loss Warranties (ILWs) from external parties that provide additional reinsurance protection for the assumed reinsurance business. 
                
     Ceded to affiliates  for the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries represents the cession of their direct business to Employers Mutual under the terms of the pooling agreement and amounts ceded to Employers Mutual under the terms of the catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program.  For the reinsurance subsidiary this line represents amounts ceded to Employers Mutual under the terms of the catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program.

    SEGMENT INFORMATION 
       
  The Company s operations consist of a property and casualty insurance segment and a reinsurance segment.  The property and casualty insurance segment writes both commercial and personal lines of insurance, with a focus on medium-sized commercial accounts.  The reinsurance segment provides reinsurance for other insurers and reinsurers.  The segments are managed separately due to differences in the insurance products sold and the business environments in which they operate.  Management evaluates the performance of its insurance segments using financial measurements based on Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP) instead of GAAP.  Such measures include premiums written, premiums earned, statutory underwriting profit (loss), and investment results, as well as loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, trade underwriting expense ratios, and combined ratios.  
  Summarized financial information for the Company s segments is as follows:

5. 
    INCOME TAXES 
     The actual income tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   differed from the  expected  income tax expense for those periods (computed by applying the United States federal corporate tax rate of   35 percent   to income before income tax expense) as follows: 

The Company had   no   provision for uncertain income tax positions at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  The Company did not recognize any interest expense or other penalties related to U.S. federal or state income taxes during the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  It is the Company s accounting policy to reflect income tax penalties as other expense, and interest as interest expense. 
  The Company files a U.S. federal income tax return, along with various state income tax returns.  The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013.

    EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS 
     The components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for Employers Mutual s pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows: 

Net periodic pension benefit cost allocated to the Company amounted to   $1.1 million   and   $456,000   for the three months and   $2.5 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Net periodic postretirement benefit income allocated to the Company amounted to   $937,000   and   $761,000   for the three months and   $2.4 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company s share of Employers Mutual s remaining   2016   planned contribution to the pension plan, if made, will be approximately   $2.5 million  .    No   contributions will be made to the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust in   2016  . 

7. 
    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
     The Company has no stock-based compensation plans of its own; however, Employers Mutual has several stock plans which utilize the common stock of the Company.  Employers Mutual can provide the common stock required under its plans by: 1) using shares of common stock that it currently owns; 2) purchasing common stock in the open market; or 3) directly purchasing common stock from the Company at the current fair value.  Employers Mutual's current practice is to purchase common stock from the Company for use in all of its stock plans (including its non-employee director stock purchase plan and its employee stock purchase plan). 
  Stock Plans 
  Employers Mutual currently maintains   two   separate stock plans for the benefit of officers and key employees of Employers Mutual and its subsidiaries.  A total of   2,250,000   shares of the Company s common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2003 Employers Mutual Casualty Company Incentive Stock Option Plan (2003 Plan) and a total of   3,000,000   shares have been reserved for issuance under the 2007 Employers Mutual Casualty Company Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Plan).  During the second quarter of 2016, the compensation committees of Employers Mutual and the Company approved the issuance of restricted stock awards to the non-employee directors of the Company under the 2007 Plan. 
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

The 2003 Plan permitted the issuance of incentive stock options only, while the 2007 Plan permits the issuance of performance shares, performance units, and other stock-based awards, in addition to qualified (incentive) and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units.  Both plans provide for a   ten  -year time limit for granting awards.  No additional options can be granted under the 2003 Plan due to the expiration of the term of the plan.  Options granted under the plans generally have a vesting period of   five years  , with options becoming exercisable in equal annual cumulative increments commencing on the first anniversary of the option grant.  Option prices cannot be less than the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant.  Restricted stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan generally have a vesting period of   four years  , with shares vesting in equal annual cumulative increments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant, with the exception of death or permanent disability, any unvested shares of restricted stock are forfeited on termination of employment, including retirement.  Holders of unvested shares of restricted stock receive compensation income equal to the amount of any dividends declared on the common stock.  During the second quarter of 2016,   2,000   shares of restricted stock was granted to non-employee directors of the Company.  The restricted stock vests over a period of   three years   or upon a director reaching   75 years   of age while an active director. 
  The Senior Executive Compensation Committee of Employers Mutual s Board of Directors grants the awards and is the administrator of the plans.  The Company s Compensation Committee must consider and approve all awards granted to the Company s executive officers and directors. 
  The Company recognized compensation expense from these plans of   $218,000   (  $142,000   net of tax) and   $167,000   (  $108,000   net of tax) for the three months and   $542,000   (  $353,000   net of tax) and   $351,000   (  $228,000   net of tax) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   118,588   shares of restricted stock were granted under the 2007 Plan to eligible participants,   69,057   shares of restricted stock vested, and   196,248   options were exercised under the plans at a weighted average exercise price of   $15.54  .

    DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
     The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized in the tables below. 

20 

     Table of Contents  

The estimated fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities is based on quoted market prices, where available.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on a variety of valuation techniques depending on the type of security. 
  Short-term investments generally include money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper.  Short-term investments are carried at fair value, which approximates cost, due to the highly liquid nature of the securities.   Short-term securities are classified as Level 1 fair value measurements when the fair values can be validated by recent trades.  When recent trades are not available, fair value is deemed to be the cost basis and the securities are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements. 
  The estimated fair value of the surplus notes is derived by discounting future expected cash flows at a rate deemed appropriate.  The discount rate was set at the average of current yields-to-maturity on several insurance company surplus notes that are traded in observable markets, adjusted upward by 50 basis points to reflect illiquidity and perceived risk premium differences.  Other assumptions include a   25  -year term (the surplus notes have no stated maturity date) and an interest rate that continues at the current   1.35 percent   interest rate.  The rate is typically adjusted every   five   years and is based upon the then-current Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate for 5-year funds available to Employers Mutual. 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The following fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. 
                     
    Level 1 - 
    Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. 

Level 2 - 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3 - 
    Prices or valuation techniques that require significant unobservable inputs because observable inputs are not available.  The unobservable inputs may reflect the Company s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use. 

The Company uses an independent pricing source to obtain the estimated fair values of a majority of its securities, subject to an internal validation.  The fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available.  This is typically the case for equity securities and money market funds, which are accordingly classified as Level 1 fair value measurements.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on a variety of valuation techniques depending on the type of security.  Fixed maturity securities, non-redeemable preferred stocks and various short-term investments in the Company s portfolio may not trade on a daily basis; however, observable inputs are utilized in their valuations, and these securities are therefore classified as Level 2 fair value measurements.  Following is a brief description of the various pricing techniques used by the independent pricing source for different asset classes. 
             
    U.S. Treasury securities (including bonds, notes, and bills) are priced according to a number of live data sources, including active market makers and inter-dealer brokers.  Prices from these sources are reviewed based on the sources  historical accuracy for individual issues and maturity ranges. 
                
    U.S. government-sponsored agencies and corporate securities (including fixed-rate corporate bonds and medium-term notes) are priced by determining a bullet (non-call) spread scale for each issuer for maturities going out to forty years.  These spreads represent credit risk and are obtained from the new issue market, secondary trading, and dealer quotes.  An option adjusted spread model is incorporated to adjust spreads of issues that have early redemption features.  The final spread is then added to the U.S. Treasury curve. 
                
    Obligations of states and political subdivisions are priced by tracking and analyzing actively quoted issues and reported trades, material event notices and benchmark yields.  Municipal bonds with similar characteristics are grouped together into market sectors, and internal yield curves are constructed daily for these sectors.  Individual bond evaluations are extrapolated from these sectors, with the ability to make individual spread adjustments for attributes such as discounts, premiums, alternative minimum tax, and/or whether or not the bond is callable. 
                
    Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are first reviewed for the appropriate pricing speed (if prepayable), spread, yield and volatility.  The securities are priced with models using spreads and other information solicited from Wall Street buy- and sell-side sources, including primary and secondary dealers, portfolio managers, and research analysts.  To determine a tranche s price, first the benchmark yield is determined and adjusted for collateral performance, tranche level attributes and market conditions.  Then the cash flow for each tranche is generated (using consensus prepayment speed assumptions including, as appropriate, a prepayment projection based on historical statistics of the underlying collateral).  The tranche-level yield is used to discount the cash flows and generate the price.  Depending on the characteristics of the tranche, a volatility-driven, multi-dimensional single cash flow stream model or an option-adjusted spread model may be used.  When cash flows or other security structure or market information is not available, broker quotes may be used.

On a quarterly basis, the Company receives from its independent pricing service a list of fixed maturity securities, if any, that were priced solely from broker quotes.  For these securities, fair value may be determined using the broker quotes, or by the Company using similar pricing techniques as the Company s independent pricing service.  Depending on the level of observable inputs, these securities would be classified as Level 2 or Level 3 fair value measurements.   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   securities priced solely from broker quotes. 
  A small number of the Company s securities are not priced by the independent pricing service.    One   equity security is reported as a Level 3 fair value measurement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , since no reliable observable inputs are used in its valuation.  This equity security continues to be reported at the fair value obtained from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  The SVO establishes a per share price for this security based on an annual review of that company s financial statements, typically performed during the second quarter.  The other securities not priced by the Company s independent pricing service at   September 30, 2016   include   nine   fixed maturity securities (  seven   at   December 31, 2015  ).    Two   of these fixed maturity securities, classified as Level 3 fair value measurements, are corporate securities that convey premium tax benefits and are not publicly traded.  The fair values for these securities are based on discounted cash flow analyses.  The other fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements.  The fair values for these fixed maturity securities were obtained from either the SVO, the Company's investment custodian, or the Company's investment department using similar pricing techniques as the Company s independent pricing service.

Presented in the tables below are a reconciliation of the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Any unrealized gains or losses on these securities are recognized in other comprehensive income.  Any gains or losses from settlements, disposals or impairments of these securities are reported as realized investment gains or losses in net income. 

There were no transfers into or out of Levels 1 or 2 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  It is the Company s policy to recognize transfers between levels at the beginning of the reporting period.

    INVESTMENTS 
     Investments of the Company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws of the state of their incorporation.  These laws prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments that may be made by insurance companies.  In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stocks and real estate mortgages.  The Company believes that it is in compliance with these laws. 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available-for-sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows.  All securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.

The following tables set forth the estimated fair values and gross unrealized losses associated with investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , listed by length of time the securities were in an unrealized loss position.

     Table of Contents  

The fair values of fixed maturity securities generally increased during the first nine months of   2016   due to a decline in interest rates.  Most of the securities that are in an unrealized loss position are considered investment grade by credit rating agencies.  Because management does not intend to sell these securities, does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before recovery, and believes it will collect the amounts due on these securities, it was determined that these securities were not  other-than-temporarily  impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The majority of the unrealized losses on common stocks at   September 30, 2016   are from the financial services, energy and consumer discretionary sectors, though no individual security accounted for a material amount of unrealized losses.  Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities for a reasonable amount of time to allow for recovery, it was determined that these securities were not  other-than-temporarily  impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  All of the Company s preferred stock holdings are perpetual preferred stocks.  The Company evaluates perpetual preferred stocks with unrealized losses for  other-than-temporary  impairment similar to fixed maturity securities since they have debt-like characteristics such as periodic cash flows in the form of dividends and call features, are rated by rating agencies and are priced like other long-term callable fixed maturity securities.  There was no evidence of any credit deterioration in the issuers of the preferred stocks and the Company does not intend to sell these securities before recovery, nor does it believe it will be required to sell these securities before recovery; therefore, it was determined that these securities were not  other-than-temporarily  impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

The amortized cost and estimated fair values of fixed maturity securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

A summary of realized investment gains and (losses) is as follows: 

Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are included in net income.  The cost of investments sold is determined on the specific identification method using the highest cost basis first.  The Company did not have any outstanding cumulative credit losses on fixed maturity securities that have been recognized in earnings from  other-than-temporary  impairments during any of the reported periods.  The amounts reported as  other-than-temporary  impairments on equity securities do not include any individually significant items.  The net realized investment losses recognized on other long-term investments during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   represent changes in the carrying value of a limited partnership that is used solely to support an equity tail-risk hedging strategy.

    CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
     The Company and Employers Mutual and its other subsidiaries are parties to numerous lawsuits arising in the normal course of the insurance business.  The Company believes that the resolution of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or its results of operations.  The companies involved have established reserves which are believed adequate to cover any potential liabilities arising out of all such pending or threatened proceedings.

The participants in the pooling agreement have purchased annuities from life insurance companies, under which the claimant is payee, to fund future payments that are fixed pursuant to specific claim settlement provisions.  The Company s share of case loss reserves eliminated by the purchase of those annuities was   $110,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company had a contingent liability for the aggregate guaranteed amount of the annuities of   $183,000   at   December 31, 2015   should the issuers of those annuities fail to perform.  Although management is not able to verify the amount, the Company would likely have a similar contingent liability at   September 30, 2016  .  The probability of a material loss due to failure of performance by the issuers of these annuities is considered remote. 

11. 
    STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
     On November 3, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a   $15.0 million   stock repurchase program.  This program does not have an expiration date.  The timing and terms of the purchases are determined by management based on board approved parameters and market conditions, and are conducted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Common stock repurchased under this program will be retired by the Company.  The Company repurchased   17,300   shares of its common stock at an average cost of   $22.14   during the first nine months of 2016.  No other purchases have been made under this program.

    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME 
     The Company has available-for-sale securities and receives an allocation of the actuarial losses and net prior service credits associated with Employers Mutual s pension and postretirement benefit plans, both of which generate accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) amounts.

    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED 
     In May 2014, the FASB updated its guidance related to the Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 of the ASC.  The objective of this update (and other related following updates) is to improve the reporting of revenue by providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, and improved disclosure requirements.  Current revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP is comprised of broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes result in different accounting for economically similar transactions.  This guidance is to be applied retrospectively to annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date (annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016).  The Company will adopt this guidance during the first quarter of 2018.  Since premium revenue from insurance contracts is excluded from the scope of this updated guidance, adoption is expected to have little or no impact on the consolidated financial condition or operating results of the Company.  The Company's largest non-premium revenue items are service charges related to the billing of the pool participants' direct written premiums to policyholders, and commission income on excess and surplus lines business marketed by EMC Underwriters, LLC, both of which are included in "Other income" in the consolidated statements of income.

In May 2015, the FASB updated its guidance related to the Financial Services-Insurance Topic 944 of the ASC.  The objective of this update is to add disclosures which provide transparency of significant estimates made in measuring the liability for losses and settlement expenses, thus providing more insight into an insurance entity's ability to underwrite and anticipate costs associated with claims.  The new disclosures primarily include incurred and paid claims development tables prepared net of reinsurance (not to exceed ten years), and a reconciliation of the carrying amount of the liability for losses and settlement expenses.  Also included (for each accident year of incurred claims development disclosed), is disclosure of incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserves, claim frequency information, and the average annual percentage payout of incurred claims by age.  This guidance is to be applied retrospectively to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and certain disclosures to interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company will adopt this guidance during the fourth quarter of 2016.  Since the guidance only affects disclosure, adoption will have no impact on the consolidated financial condition or operating results of the Company. 
  In January 2016, the FASB updated its guidance related to the Financial Instruments-Overall Subtopic 825-10 of the ASC.  The objective of this update is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information.  The major change in reporting from this update that will impact the Company is a requirement that equity investments (excluding those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that are consolidated) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  While all of the Company's equity investments are already measured at fair value (with the exception of those that are consolidated and those that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting), the Company currently classifies all of its investments in equity securities as available-for-sale, and as such, the changes in fair value are currently recognized in other comprehensive income rather than net income.  This guidance is to be applied to annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The Company will adopt this guidance during the first quarter of 2018.  Adoption is not expected to impact consolidated stockholders' equity, but is expected to introduce a material amount of volatility to the Company's consolidated net income. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance in Leases Topic 842 of the ASC, which supersedes the guidance in Leases Topic 840 of the ASC.  The objective of this update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company will adopt this guidance during the first quarter of 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial condition and operating results. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance in Financial Instruments-Credit Losses Topic 326 of the ASC.  The objective of this update is to provide information about expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit.  Specifically, this updated guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology, that delays recognition of a loss until it is probable a loss has been incurred, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses considering a broader range of reasonable and supportable information.  This guidance covers financial assets that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, thus will not be applicable to the Company's equity investments upon implementation of the updated guidance described above for the Financial Instruments-Overall Subtopic 825-10.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and is to be applied with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (modified-retrospective approach).  Early adoption is permitted, but only to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company will adopt this guidance during the first quarter of 2020.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial condition and operating results.

  COMPANY OVERVIEW 
  The Company, a majority owned subsidiary of Employers Mutual Casualty Company (Employers Mutual), is an insurance holding company with operations in property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. 
  Property and casualty insurance operations are conducted through three subsidiaries and represent the most significant segment of the Company s business, totaling   77 percent   of consolidated premiums earned during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  The property and casualty insurance operations are integrated with the property and casualty insurance operations of Employers Mutual through participation in a reinsurance pooling agreement.  Because the Company conducts its property and casualty insurance operations together with Employers Mutual through the reinsurance pooling agreement, the Company shares the same business philosophy, management, employees and facilities as Employers Mutual and offers the same types of insurance products. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

Reinsurance operations are conducted through EMC Reinsurance Company and accounted for   23 percent   of consolidated premiums earned during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  The principal business activity of EMC Reinsurance Company is to assume, through a quota share reinsurance agreement, 100 percent of Employers Mutual s assumed reinsurance business, subject to certain exceptions. 
  T  he Inter-Company Committees of the boards of directors of the Company and Employers Mutual approved a change in the inter-company reinsurance program between the Company's reinsurance subsidiary and Employers Mutual for calendar year 2016, and also approved a new inter-company reinsurance program between the Company's three insurance subsidiaries in the property and casualty insurance segment and Employers Mutual for calendar year 2016.  These reinsurance programs are intended to reduce the volatility of the Company's quarterly results caused by excessive catastrophe and storms losses, and will provide protection from both the frequency and severity of such losses.  For detailed information regarding the inter-company reinsurance programs, see note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
  The accounting policies and estimates considered by management to be critically important in the preparation and understanding of the Company s financial statements and related disclosures are presented in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company s   2015   Form 10-K. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, management implemented a new reserving methodology for the determination of direct bulk reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment.  The new methodology, which is referred to as the accident year ultimate estimate approach, better conforms to industry practices and will provide increased transparency of the drivers of the property and casualty insurance segment's performance.  Although the reserves carried at September 30, 2016 were calculated under the new reserving methodology, the explicit drivers of development on prior years' reserves for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 cannot be identified because the reserves carried at December 31, 2015 were calculated under the prior reserving methodology, and the implicit accident year ultimate assumptions underlying that methodology are not known.  The explicit drivers of development on prior years' reserves will be identifiable beginning in the first quarter of 2017. 
  The implementation of the new reserving methodology did not have a material impact on total carried reserves for the property and casualty insurance segment at September 30, 2016; however, approximately $5.6 million of incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss reserves and settlement expense reserves were reallocated from prior accident years to the current accident year in multiple lines of business.  This reduction in prior accident years' reserves is reported as favorable development; however, this development is "mechanical" in nature, and did not have any impact on earnings because the total amount of carried reserves did not change as a result of this reallocation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Results of operations by segment and on a consolidated basis for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

1    Large losses are defined as reported current accident year losses greater than $500 for the EMC Insurance Companies' pool, excluding catastrophe and storm losses.  Under the property and casualty insurance segment's prior reserving methodology, large losses had a direct impact on earnings.  Under the new reserving methodology, large losses are taken into consideration when establishing the current accident quarter/year ultimate estimates of losses, but there is no longer a direct relationship between large losses and earnings.  As a result, it is no longer meaningful to report large losses separately.  The amount of large losses previously reported for the first six months of 2016 has not been carried forward and disclosed for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, because it would not be comparable to the amount reported for the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  The following table presents the reported amounts of favorable development experienced on prior years  reserves and the portion of the reported development amounts that resulted from the reallocation of direct bulk reserves from prior accident years to the current accident year in connection with the change in reserving methodology that was implemented in the property and casualty insurance segment during the third quarter of 2016 (no impact on earnings).  The result is an approximation of the implied amount of favorable development that had an impact on earnings.

The following table presents the reported amounts of (favorable) adverse development experienced on prior years  reserves and the portion of the reported development amounts that resulted from the reallocation of reserves on a two-year contract from the current accident year to the prior accident year in the reinsurance segment during the third quarter of 2015 (no impact on earnings).  The result is an approximation of the implied amount of (favorable) adverse development that had an impact on earnings.

1    Large losses are defined as reported current accident year losses greater than $500 for the EMC Insurance Companies' pool, excluding catastrophe losses.   Under the property and casualty insurance segment's prior reserving methodology, large losses had a direct impact on earnings.  Under the new reserving methodology, large losses are taken into consideration when establishing the current accident quarter/year ultimate estimates of losses, but there is no longer a direct relationship between large losses and earnings.  As a result, it is no longer meaningful to report large losses separately.  The amount of large losses previously reported for the first six months of 2016 has not been carried forward and disclosed for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, because it would not be comparable to the amount reported for the first nine months of 2015.

The following table presents the reported amounts of favorable development experienced on prior years  reserves and the portion of the reported development amounts that resulted from 1) the reallocation of direct bulk reserves from prior accident years to the current accident year in connection with the change in reserving methodology that was implemented in the property and casualty insurance segment during the third quarter of 2016 (no impact on earnings), and 2) the reallocation of reserves on a two-year contract from the current accident year to the prior accident year in the reinsurance segment during the third quarter of 2015 (no impact on earnings).  The result is an approximation of the implied amount of favorable development that had an impact on earnings. 

The Company reported net income of   $4.1 million   (  $0.20   per share) during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.2 million   (  $0.54   per share) during the same period in   2015  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net income totaled   $24.9 million   (  $1.19   per share) compared to   $40.3 million   (  $1.96   per share) during the same period in   2015  .  The decreases in net income are primarily attributed to a significant decline in realized investment gains (realized investment losses were reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to realized investment gains for the same periods in 2015), and a decline in underwriting profitability.  The decline in realized investment gains was primarily driven by the Company's equity tail-risk hedging strategy, which generated a large amount of realized investment gains in August of 2015 when the equity markets declined sharply, but has otherwise generated realized investment losses.  The decline in underwriting profitability is attributed to the property and casualty insurance segment, which was primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe and storm losses, but also reflects poor underwriting results in the personal lines of business and commercial auto line of business, and an increase in policyholder dividend expense.  On a consolidated basis, underwriting results remained profitable through the first nine months of the year, as the reinsurance segment's underwriting profit more than offset an underwriting loss in the property and casualty insurance segment.   
    
  Premium income 
  Premiums earned increased   4.4 percent   and   2.9 percent   to   $152.2 million   and   $441.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $145.8 million   and   $429.1 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  Both segments reported small increases in premium income for these periods, despite increasingly competitive market conditions.  Rate levels for both segments continue to be constrained by increased competition, especially for quality accounts with good loss experience.  Average rate level increases are just slightly positive in the property and casualty insurance segment during the first nine months of 2016, and are expected to remain at that level during the remainder of the year.  The January 1, 2016 renewal season, when approximately 70 percent of the reinsurance segment's business renews, saw continued pricing pressure, though the deterioration in pricing slowed considerably from that experienced in 2015.

Premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased   2.3 percent   and   1.6 percent   to   $116.4 million   and   $338.6 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $113.8 million   and   $333.2 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  The increases reported in 2016 reflect $765,000 and $7.1 million, respectively, of premiums ceded to Employers Mutual for the cost of the new inter-company reinsurance program.  Excluding these amounts, premiums earned increased 3.7 percent and 3.0 percent for the three and nine month periods, reflecting growth in insured exposures, an increase in new business, and small rate level increases on renewal business.  New business premium (representing 14 percent of the pool participants  direct written premiums at September 30, 2016) is approximately 13 percent higher than the same period in 2015.  Commercial lines accounted for most of the increase in new business premium; however, personal lines also reported an increase after several years of declining premium.  Commercial lines new business continues to be in the desired range of growth, and was strongest outside of the core Midwest market, which helps diversify the pool participants' book of business geographically, while staying consistent with the industry and line of business mix of the existing book of business.  Renewal business premium increased approximately two percent during the first nine months of 2016.  Excluding the workers' compensation line of business, renewal rates across both commercial and personal lines of business increased approximately one percent during the first nine months of 2016.  Factoring in the continued implementation of some mandatory rate reductions on workers' compensation business in a few states, the overall renewal rate increase is still positive, but is less than one percent.  Management continues to focus on the implementation of its new personal lines strategy, and is encouraged by the increase in new business premium.  During the first nine months of 2016, the overall policy retention rate remained strong at 86.7 percent (commercial lines at 86.9 percent and personal lines at 84.5 percent).  These retention rates approximate those at the end of 2015. 
  Premiums earned for the reinsurance segment increased   11.8 percent   and   7.2 percent   to   $35.8 million   and   $102.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $32.0 million   and   $95.9 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  These increases reflect reductions in the total cost of the revised excess of loss reinsurance program with Employers Mutual totaling $246,000 for the three months and $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  In 2016, the total cost of the reinsurance program includes the premium paid to Employers Mutual, as well as the cost of Industry Loss Warranties (ILWs) that have been purchased from external parties to provide increased protection in peak exposure territories.  During 2015, the premium paid to Employers Mutual (8 percent of total assumed reinsurance premiums written) included the cost of ILWs purchased by Employers Mutual for its benefit.  The reinsurance subsidiary has purchased $5.1 million of ILWs during the first nine months of 2016, with $1.2 million and $2.2 million of ceded earned premium recognized on the ILWs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  Excluding the reduction in the cost of the revised excess of loss reinsurance program with Employers Mutual, premiums earned were up 11.0 percent and 4.7 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These increases were driven by new accounts and growth in the pro rata line of business, partially offset by a decline in the marine business attributed to the offshore energy and liability proportional account.  During 2015, the ceded premium associated with the excess of loss reinsurance program was allocated to all lines of business (both pro rata and excess of loss) because it was a quota share arrangement whereby the premium was based on total assumed reinsurance premiums written.  Beginning in 2016, the ceded premium for the revised excess of loss reinsurance program is being allocated to only the excess of loss business. 
    
  Losses and settlement expenses 
  Losses and settlement expenses increased   5.3 percent   and   5.5 percent   to   $108.2 million   and   $296.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $102.7 million   and   $280.6 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  The loss and settlement expense ratios increased to   71.1 percent   and   67.1 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   70.4 percent   and   65.4 percent   for the same periods in   2015  .  The loss and settlement expense ratios increased for both segments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase in the property and casualty insurance segment's ratio is attributed to an increase in catastrophe and storm losses, while the reinsurance segment's increase is largely due to a low amount of reported large losses in 2015.  The actuarial analysis of the Company s carried reserves as of September 30, 2016 indicated that the level of reserve adequacy was consistent with other recent evaluations.  From management s perspective, this measure is more relevant to an understanding of the Company s results of operations than the composition of the underwriting results between the current and prior accident years.

The loss and settlement expense ratios for the property and casualty insurance segment increased to   70.2 percent   and   66.5 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   66.8 percent   and   64.7 percent   for the same periods in   2015  .  These increases are primarily attributed to higher catastrophe and storm losses.  Catastrophe and storm losses accounted for 12.7 and 10.3 percentage points of the loss and settlement expense ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 8.7 and 8.6 percentage points for the same periods in 2015.  The most recent 10-year averages for these periods are 13.6 and 12.7 percentage points, respectively.  The property and casualty insurance segment recovered $3.5 million and $5.1 million of catastrophe and storm losses under the January 1 through June 30 excess of loss reinsurance treaty with Employers Mutual during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  No recoveries were made under the July 1 through December 31 treaty; however, only $213,000 of the retention remains under that treaty, meaning that catastrophe and storms losses will be capped at $213,000 in the fourth quarter, unless the $12.0 million limit of protection is exceeded.  Taking the loss recoveries received and the premiums paid to Employers Mutual into consideration, the new reinsurance program with Employers Mutual reduced the catastrophe and storm loss ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 by 2.4 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively.  The personal lines of business and the commercial auto line of business continued to generate unfavorable results during the third quarter, posting loss and settlement expense ratios of 98.7 percent and 93.5 percent, respectively.  The personal lines' ultimate loss estimate reflects an increase in loss severity for the current accident quarter, and the commercial auto line's ultimate loss estimate reflects an increase in both loss frequency and severity for the current accident quarter.   As previously noted, management continues to focus on the implementation of its new personal lines strategy, and has invested a significant amount of time and resources toward improving the performance of the commercial auto line of business in 2016, including more aggressive underwriting and pricing, proper classification of risks and a review of the class of business restrictions; however, these efforts have not yet had a significant impact on performance.  Industry projections forecast continued deterioration in this line of business, and management forecasts similar deterioration in the Company's commercial auto business if no additional steps are taken to improve profitability.  Recognizing the importance of this issue, management has implemented a more intensive, multi-year project with a goal of returning this line of business to profitability within the next three years.  Favorable development on prior years' reserves increased substantially for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  As previously noted, approximately $5.6 million of the increase in favorable development is "mechanical" in nature and did not have an impact on earnings because it resulted from the movement of direct bulk reserves from prior accident years into the current accident year in connection with the change in reserving methodology.  Under the previous reserving methodology employed through the second quarter of 2016, development amounts could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on a number of factors, including the number of claims settled and the settlement terms.  With the conversion to the new reserving methodology as of the end of the third quarter, development on prior accident years' reserves is determined solely by changes in the prior accident years' ultimate loss and settlement expense ratios.  During the transition to the new reserving methodology, changes in the assumptions underlying the ultimate ratios previously established for accident years 2015 and prior are difficult to quantify as the implied ultimate ratios under the previous methodology were based on implicit, rather than explicit, actuarial assumptions.  Therefore, comparison of 2016 third quarter and year-to-date development amounts to the 2015 development amounts provides little meaningful information, as the prior accident year reserve allocation method lacked explicit frequency and severity assumptions.  The explicit drivers of development on prior years' reserves will be identifiable beginning in the first quarter of 2017.    
  The loss and settlement expense ratio for the reinsurance segment decreased to   74.1 percent   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   83.4 percent   for the same period in   2015  .  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the loss and settlement expense ratio increased to   69.0 percent   from   67.9 percent   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is attributed to a decline in catastrophe and storm losses.  Catastrophe and storm losses for the third quarter of 2015 included an estimated loss of $4.5 million ($4.1 million net of reinsurance recovery under the excess of loss reinsurance protection provided by Employers Mutual) from the Tianjin, China explosion.  Catastrophe and storm losses were also lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, but to a lesser extent, due to a $3.5 million loss stemming from the Alberta, Canada wildfire that occurred during the second quarter.  No recoveries have been made under the revised excess of loss reinsurance program with Employers Mutual during the first nine months of 2016.  The decline in the total cost of the revised excess of loss reinsurance program with Employers Mutual produced decreases of 1.2 and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, in the loss and settlement expense ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These reductions are reflected in the catastrophe and storm loss ratios, which declined to 6.3 and 10.5 percentage points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, from 24.5 and 12.6 percentage points for the same periods in 2015.  The most recent 10-year averages for catastrophe and storm losses for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, are 17.1 and 14.1 percentage points, respectively.  The increase in the loss and settlement expense ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is attributed to an increase in reported large losses (losses greater than $100,000).  The  development amounts reported for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $2.4 million of adverse development that resulted from a reallocation of reserves on a two-year contract from the current accident year to the prior accident year, and therefore did not have an impact on earnings.

Acquisition and other expenses 
  Acquisition and other expenses increased   5.8 percent   and   6.3 percent   to   $48.4 million   and   $144.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $45.7 million   and   $135.7 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  The acquisition expense ratios increased to   31.8 percent   and   32.7 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   31.4 percent   and   31.6 percent   for the same periods in   2015  .  These increases are primarily attributed to an increase in policyholder dividend expense resulting from favorable loss experience on some safety dividend groups in the property and casualty insurance segment. 
  The acquisition expense ratios for the property and casualty insurance segment increased to   34.2 percent   and   35.2 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   33.3 percent   and   33.1 percent   for the same periods in   2015  .  These increases are largely attributed to higher policyholder dividend expense resulting from favorable loss experience on some safety dividend groups.  The 2016 ratios also reflect the premiums ceded to Employers Mutual under the new aggregate catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program, which added 0.2 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, to the ratios.  
  The acquisition expense ratios for the reinsurance segment decreased to   23.9 percent   and   24.2 percent   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   24.5 percent   and   26.5 percent   for the same periods in   2015  .  The larger decrease for the nine month period is primarily attributed to a $1.1 million commission adjustment reported by a ceding company during the first quarter of 2015 that related to prior periods.  The 2016 ratios reflect the reduction in the total cost of the revised catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program with Employers Mutual, which reduced the acquisition expense ratios by 1.0 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  An increase in contingent commission expense during the third quarter partially offset the decline in the acquisition expense ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   
    
  Investment results 
  Net investment income increased   1.5 percent   and   5.7 percent   to   $11.5 million   and   $35.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $11.3 million   and   $33.9 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  These increases are primarily attributed to higher amounts of dividend income in 2016, but also reflect an increase in interest income resulting from a higher average invested balance in fixed maturity securities.  Current interest rate levels remain below the average book yield of the fixed maturity portfolio, and will therefore likely continue to limit future growth in net investment income.  The average coupon rate on the fixed maturity portfolio, excluding interest-only securities, has declined slightly over the past year, coming in at 3.7 percent at September 30, 2016 compared to 3.9 percent at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.  The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, excluding interest-only securities, increased slightly to 4.7 at September 30, 2016 from 4.6 at December 31, 2015.  The Company s equity portfolio produced dividend income of $1.6 million and $5.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 million and $4.0 million during the same periods in 2015. 
  The Company had net realized investment losses of   $1.2 million   and   $643,000   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net realized investment gains of   $7.5 million   and   $11.6 million   during the same periods in   2015  .  The reported amounts include losses of   $1.9 million   and   $5.3 million   generated during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from declines in the carrying value of a limited partnership that the Company invests in to help protect it from a sudden and significant decline in the value of its equity portfolio (an equity tail-risk hedging strategy).  Due to the sharp decline of the equity markets in August of 2015, this limited partnership produced gains of   $7.2 million   and   $3.8 million   during the same respective periods in 2015.  The Company recognized "other-than-temporary" impairment losses of   $275,000   and   $976,000   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $628,000   and   $1.3 million   during the same periods in 2015.  These impairment losses were recognized on securities held in the Company's equity portfolio. 
    
  Other income 
  Included in other income are foreign currency exchange gains and losses recognized on the reinsurance segment s foreign currency denominated reinsurance business.  The reinsurance segment had foreign currency exchange losses of $317,000 and $545,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to gains of $254,000 and $984,000 during the same periods in   2015  .

Income tax 
  Income tax expense decreased to   $918,000   and   $9.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.7 million   and   $17.5 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  The effective tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   18.2 percent   and   26.8 percent  , compared to   29.7 percent   and   30.3 percent   for the same periods in   2015  .  The primary contributors to the differences between these effective tax rates and the United States federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent are tax-exempt interest income earned and the dividends received deduction. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet cash obligations.  The Company had positive cash flows from operations of   $75.1 million   and   $83.0 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Company typically generates substantial positive cash flows from operations because cash from premium payments is generally received in advance of cash payments made to settle claims.  These positive cash flows provide the foundation of the Company s asset/liability management program and are the primary driver of the Company s liquidity.  The Company invests in high quality, liquid securities to match the anticipated payments of losses and settlement expenses of the underlying insurance policies.  Because the timing of the losses is uncertain, the majority of the portfolio is maintained in short to intermediate maturity securities that can be easily liquidated or that generate adequate cash flow to meet liabilities. 
  The Company is a holding company whose principal asset is its investment in its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and its reinsurance subsidiary ( insurance subsidiaries ).  As a holding company, the Company is dependent upon cash dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to meet all its obligations, including cash dividends to stockholders and the funding of the Company s stock repurchase programs.  State insurance regulations restrict the maximum amount of dividends insurance companies can pay without prior regulatory approval.  The maximum amount of dividends that the insurance subsidiaries can pay to the Company in   2016   without prior regulatory approval is approximately $49.8 million.  The Company received   $3.6 million   and   $7.1 million   of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and paid cash dividends to its stockholders totaling   $11.8 million   and   $10.3 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company s insurance subsidiaries must maintain adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met; however, because of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  participation in the pooling agreement and the reinsurance subsidiary s participation in the quota share agreement, they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company.  This is because under the terms of the pooling and quota share agreements, Employers Mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the Company s reinsurance subsidiary, and then settles inter-company balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies on a monthly (pool participants) or quarterly (reinsurance subsidiary) basis. 
  At the insurance subsidiary level, the primary sources of cash are premium income, investment income and proceeds from called or matured investments.  The principal outflows of cash are payments of claims, commissions, premium taxes, operating expenses, income taxes, dividends, interest and principal payments on debt, and investment purchases.  Cash outflows vary because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for unpaid losses and the potential for large losses, either individually or in the aggregate.  Accordingly, the insurance subsidiaries maintain investment and reinsurance programs intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments.  The insurance subsidiaries also have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis (180 days) from Employers Mutual and its subsidiaries and affiliate under an Inter-Company Loan Agreement.  In addition, Employers Mutual maintains access to a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank that could be used to provide the insurance subsidiaries additional liquidity if needed. 
  The Company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in relatively short-term and highly liquid investments to ensure the availability of funds to pay claims and expenses.  A variety of maturities are maintained in the Company s investment portfolio to assure adequate liquidity.  The maturity structure of the fixed maturity portfolio is also established by the relative attractiveness of yields on short, intermediate and long-term securities.  The Company does not invest in non-investment grade debt securities.  Any non-investment grade securities held by the Company are the result of rating downgrades subsequent to their purchase.

The Company invests for the long term and generally purchases fixed maturity securities with the intent to hold them to maturity.  Despite this intent, the Company currently classifies fixed maturity securities as available-for-sale to provide flexibility in the management of its investment portfolio.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had net unrealized holding gains, net of deferred taxes, on its fixed maturity securities available-for-sale of   $34.2 million   and   $20.0 million  , respectively.  The fluctuation in the fair value of these investments is primarily due to changes in the interest rate environment during this time period, but also reflects fluctuations in risk premium spreads over U.S. Treasuries.  Since the Company intends to hold fixed maturity securities to maturity, such fluctuations in the fair value of these investments are not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the Company, as forced liquidations of investments are not anticipated.  The Company closely monitors the bond market and makes appropriate adjustments in its portfolio as conditions warrant. 
  The majority of the Company s assets are invested in fixed maturity securities.  These investments provide a substantial amount of investment income that supplements underwriting results and contributes to net earnings.  As these investments mature, or are called, the proceeds are reinvested at current interest rates, which may be higher or lower than those now being earned; therefore, more or less investment income may be available to contribute to net earnings.  Due to the prolonged low interest rate environment, proceeds from calls and maturities in recent years have been reinvested at lower yields, which has had a negative impact on investment income. 
  The Company held   $9.9 million   in minority ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited liability companies at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company invested $4.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in a limited partnership that is designed to help protect the Company from a sudden and significant decline in the value of its equity portfolio.  This investment is included in "other long-term investments" in the Company's financial statements and is carried under the equity method of accounting.  
  During 2015, the Company began participating in a reverse repurchase arrangement, involving the purchase of investment securities from third-party sellers with the agreement that the purchased securities be sold back to the third-party sellers for agreed-upon prices at specified future dates.  The third-party sellers are required to pledge collateral with a value greater than the amount of cash received in the transactions.  In accordance with GAAP, the investment securities purchased under the reverse repurchase agreements are not reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, but instead a receivable is recorded for the principal amount lent.  The Company's receivable under reverse repurchase agreements was $16.9 million at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company s cash balance was   $350,000   and   $224,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , Employers Mutual made no contributions to its qualified pension plan or postretirement benefit plans.  The Company s share of Employers Mutual s   2016   planned contribution to its pension plan, if made, will be approximately   $2.5 million  .    No   contributions will be made to the postretirement benefit plans in   2016  . 
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , Employers Mutual contributed $4.0 million to its qualified pension plan ($1.2 million allocated to the Company), but made no contributions to its postretirement benefit plans.  The Company reimbursed Employers Mutual $1.2 million for its share of the total   2015   pension contribution (no contributions were made to the postretirement benefit plans during   2015  ).  
    
  Capital Resources 
  Capital resources consist of stockholders  equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations.  For the Company s insurance subsidiaries, capital resources are required to support premium writings.  Regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to its statutory surplus should not exceed three to one.  On an annualized basis, all of the Company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries were well under this guideline at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis, and are subject to regulations under which the payment of dividends from statutory surplus is restricted and may require prior approval of their domiciliary insurance regulatory authorities.  The Company s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to annual Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements that may further impact their ability to pay dividends.  RBC requirements attempt to measure minimum statutory capital needs based upon the risks in a company s mix of products and investment portfolio.  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company s insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory capital of $485.2 million, which is well in excess of the minimum risk-based capital requirement of $77.4 million.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The Company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have   $25.0 million   of surplus notes issued to Employers Mutual.  The interest rate on the surplus notes is 1.35 percent.  Reviews of the interest rate are conducted by the Inter-Company Committees of the boards of directors of the Company and Employers Mutual every five years, with the next review due in 2018.  Payments of interest and repayments of principal can only be made out of the applicable subsidiary s statutory surplus and are subject to prior approval by the insurance commissioner of the respective states of domicile.  The surplus notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all obligations or liabilities of the applicable insurance subsidiaries.  Total interest expense incurred on these surplus notes was   $253,000   during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  .  During the first quarter of   2016  , the Company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries paid Employers Mutual for the interest that had been accrued on the surplus notes during   2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Employers Mutual collects from agents, policyholders and ceding companies all written premiums associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and the assumed reinsurance business ceded to the reinsurance subsidiary.  Employers Mutual also collects from its reinsurers all losses and settlement expenses recoverable under the reinsurance contracts protecting the pool participants and, starting in 2016, the reinsurance subsidiary, as well as the fronting business ceded to the reinsurance subsidiary.  Employers Mutual settles with the pool participants (monthly) and the reinsurance subsidiary (quarterly) the premiums written from these insurance policies and the paid losses and settlement expenses recoverable under the external reinsurance contracts, providing full credit for the premiums written and the paid losses and settlement expenses recoverable under the external reinsurance contracts generated during the period (not just the collected portion).  Due to this arrangement, and since a significant portion of the premium balances are collected over the course of the underlying coverage periods, Employers Mutual carries a substantial receivable balance for insurance and reinsurance premiums in process of collection and, to a lesser extent, paid losses and settlement expenses recoverable from the external reinsurance companies.  Any of these receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged-off by Employers Mutual and the expense is charged to the reinsurance subsidiary or allocated to the pool members on the basis of pool participation.  As a result, the Company has off-balance sheet arrangements with an unconsolidated entity that results in credit-risk exposures (Employers Mutual s insurance and reinsurance premium receivable balances, and paid loss and settlement expense recoverable amounts) that are not reflected in the Company s financial statements.  The average annual expense for such charge-offs allocated to the Company over the past ten years is $366,000.  Based on this historical data, this credit-risk exposure is not considered to be material to the Company s results of operations or financial position and, accordingly, no loss contingency liability has been recorded. 
    
  Investment Impairments and Considerations 
  The Company recorded   $275,000   and   $976,000   of "other-than-temporary" investment impairment losses during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $628,000   and   $1.3 million   during the same periods in   2015  .  The impairment losses were recognized on securities held in the Company's equity portfolio. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities as presented in the following table.  The estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available.  In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on a variety of valuation techniques depending on the type of security.  None of these securities are considered to be in concentrations by either security type or industry.  The Company uses several factors to determine whether the carrying value of an individual security has been  other-than-temporarily  impaired.  Such factors include, but are not limited to, the security s value and performance in the context of the overall markets, length of time and extent the security s fair value has been below carrying value, key corporate events and, for fixed maturity securities, the amount of collateral available.  Based on these factors, the absence of management s intent to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity, and the fact that management does not anticipate that it will be forced to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity, it was determined that the carrying value of these securities were not  other-than-temporarily  impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  Risks and uncertainties inherent in the methodology utilized in this evaluation process include interest rate risk, equity price risk, and the overall performance of the economy, all of which have the potential to adversely affect the value of the Company s investments.  Should a determination be made at some point in the future that these unrealized losses are  other-than-temporary , the Company s earnings would be reduced by approximately   $7.4 million  , net of tax; however, the Company s financial position would not be affected because unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are reflected in the Company s financial statements as a component of stockholders  equity, net of deferred taxes.

Following is a schedule of the length of time securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The Company does not purchase non-investment grade fixed maturity securities.  Any non-investment grade fixed maturity securities held are the result of rating downgrades that occurred subsequent to their purchase.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   $3.1 million   of non-investment grade fixed maturity securities in a net unrealized gain position of   $57,000  .

Following is a schedule of gross realized losses recognized in the first   nine   months of   2016  .  The schedule is aged according to the length of time the underlying securities were in an unrealized loss position.   

LEASES, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
  One of the Company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries leases office facilities in Bismarck, North Dakota with lease terms expiring in 2024.  Employers Mutual has entered into various leases for branch and service office facilities with lease terms expiring through 2025.  All of these lease costs are included as expenses under the pooling agreement.  The Company s contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   did not change materially from those presented in the Company s   2015   Form 10-K. 
  The participants in the pooling agreement are subject to guaranty fund assessments by states in which they write business.  Guaranty fund assessments are used by states to pay policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurers domiciled in those states.  Many states allow assessments to be recovered through premium tax offsets.  The Company has accrued estimated guaranty fund assessments of   $869,000   and $912,000 as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Premium tax offsets of   $1.1 million   and $1.1 million, which are related to prior guarantee fund payments and current assessments, have been accrued as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The guaranty fund assessments are expected to be paid over the next two years and the premium tax offsets are expected to be realized within ten years of the payments.  The participants in the pooling agreement are also subject to second-injury fund assessments, which are designed to encourage employers to employ workers with pre-existing disabilities.  The Company had accrued estimated second-injury fund assessments of   $2.0 million   and $1.9 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The second-injury fund assessment accruals are based on projected loss payments.  The periods over which the assessments will be paid is not known. 
  The participants in the pooling agreement have purchased annuities from life insurance companies, under which the claimant is payee, to fund future payments that are fixed pursuant to specific claim settlement provisions.  Based on information provided by the life insurance companies on an annual basis, the Company s share of case loss reserves eliminated by the purchase of those annuities was   $110,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company had a contingent liability for the aggregate guaranteed amount of the annuities of   $183,000   at   December 31, 2015   should the issuers of those annuities fail to perform.  Although management is not able to verify the amount, the Company would likely have a similar contingent liability at   September 30, 2016  .  The probability of a material loss due to failure of performance by the issuers of these annuities is considered remote.

ITEM 3. 
    Q  UANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The main objectives in managing the Company s investment portfolios are to maximize after-tax investment return while minimizing risk, in order to provide maximum support for the underwriting operations.  Investment strategies are developed based upon many factors including underwriting results, regulatory requirements, fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks.  Investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals and are supervised by the investment committees of the respective boards of directors for each of the Company s subsidiaries. 
  Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, and is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded.  The market risks of the financial instruments owned by the Company relate to the investment portfolio, which exposes the Company to interest rate (inclusive of credit spreads) and equity price risk and, to a lesser extent, credit quality and prepayment risk.  Monitoring systems and analytical tools are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk; however, there can be no assurance that future changes in interest rates, creditworthiness of issuers, prepayment activity, liquidity available in the market and other general market conditions will not have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations, liquidity or financial position. 
  Two categories of influences on market risk exist as it relates to financial instruments.  First are systematic aspects, which relate to the investing environment and are out of the control of the investment manager.  Second are non-systematic aspects, which relate to the construction of the investment portfolio through investment policies and decisions, and are under the direct control of the investment manager.  The Company is committed to controlling non-systematic risk through sound investment policies and diversification. 
  Further analysis of the components of the Company s market risk (including interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit quality risk, and prepayment risk) can be found in the Company s   2015   Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely making known to them material information relating to the Company and the Company s consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act. 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   third   quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
