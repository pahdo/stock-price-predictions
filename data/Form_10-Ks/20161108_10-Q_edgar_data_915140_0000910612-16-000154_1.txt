EXPLANATORY NOTE   
    This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of CBL   Associates Properties, Inc. and CBL   Associates Limited Partnership.  Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to the "Company" mean CBL   Associates Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  References to the "Operating Partnership" mean CBL   Associates Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries.  The terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to the Company or the Company and the Operating Partnership collectively, as the context requires. 
  The Company is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  The Company is the 100% owner of two qualified REIT subsidiaries, CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc.  At   September 30, 2016  , CBL Holdings I, Inc., the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, owned a   1.0%   general partner interest in the Operating Partnership and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned an   84.8%   limited partner interest for a combined interest held by the Company of   85.8%  .   
  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company's subsidiary, CBL Holdings I, Inc., has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's activities.  Management operates the Company and the Operating Partnership as one business.  The management of the Company consists of the same individuals that manage the Operating Partnership.  The Company's only material asset is its indirect ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the Company conducts substantially all its business through the Operating Partnership as described in the preceding paragraph.  The Company also issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership holds all of the assets and indebtedness of the Company and, through affiliates, retains the ownership interests in the Company's joint ventures.  Except for the net proceeds of offerings of equity by the Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units on a one-for-one basis, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business through its operations and its incurrence of indebtedness. 
  We believe that combining the two quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the Company and the Operating Partnership provides the following benefits: 
             
    enhances investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business; 
                
    eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation, since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
                
    creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
     To help investors understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate condensed consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership.  Noncontrolling interests, shareholders' equity and partners' capital are the main areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership.  A single set of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements is presented that includes separate discussions for the Company and the Operating Partnership, when applicable.  A combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section is also included that presents combined information and discrete information related to each entity, as applicable. 
  In order to highlight the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report includes the following sections that provide separate financial and other information for the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
             
    condensed consolidated financial statements; 
                
    certain accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, including Note 5 - Unconsolidated Affiliates, Redeemable Interests, Noncontrolling Interests and Cost Method Investments; Note 6 - Mortgage and Other Indebtedness; Note 7 - Comprehensive Income; and Note 11 - Earnings per Share and Earnings per Unit; 
                
    controls and procedures in Item 4 of Part I of this report;  
                
    information concerning unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds in Item 2 of Part II of this report; and 
                
    certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer included as Exhibits 31.1 through 32.4.

Note 1   Organization and Basis of Presentation 
  CBL   Associates Properties, Inc. ( CBL ), a Delaware corporation, is a self-managed, self-administered, fully-integrated real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that is engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, leasing, management and operation of regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers and office properties.  Its properties are located in   27   states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States. 
  CBL conducts substantially all of its business through CBL   Associates Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), which is a variable interest entity ("VIE").  In accordance with the guidance in ASC 810,   Consolidations,   the Company is exempt from providing further disclosures related to the Operating Partnership's VIE classification.  The Operating Partnership consolidates the financial statements of all entities in which it has a controlling financial interest or where it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership owned interests in the following properties: 

(1) 
    Category consists of regional malls, open-air centers and outlet centers (including   one   mixed-use center). 
              (2) 
    Includes   three   malls that are classified as held for sale as at   September 30, 2016  .  See    Note 4    for more information. 
              (3) 
    Includes CBL's   two   corporate office buildings. 
              (4) 
    The Operating Partnership accounts for these investments using the equity method because one or more of the other partners have substantive participating rights. 
              (5) 
    Includes   four   office buildings that are classified as held for sale at   September 30, 2016  .  See    Note 5    for further details. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership had interests in the following properties under development:

The Operating Partnership also holds options to acquire certain development properties owned by third parties. 
  CBL is the   100%   owner of   two   qualified REIT subsidiaries, CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc.  At   September 30, 2016  , CBL Holdings I, Inc., the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, owned a   1.0%   general partner interest in the Operating Partnership and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned an   84.8%   limited partner interest for a combined interest held by CBL of   85.8%  . 
  As used herein, the term "Company" includes CBL   Associates Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CBL   Associates Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  The term "Operating Partnership" refers to CBL   Associates Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries. 
  The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership is held by CBL   Associates, Inc., its shareholders and affiliates and certain senior officers of the Company (collectively "CBL's Predecessor"), all of which contributed their interests in certain real estate properties and joint ventures to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a limited partner interest when the Operating Partnership was formed in November 1993, and by various third parties.  At   September 30, 2016  , CBL s Predecessor owned a   9.1%   limited partner interest and third parties owned a   5.1%   limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership.  CBL's Predecessor also owned   3.7 million   shares of CBL s common stock at   September 30, 2016  , for a total combined effective interest of   11.0%   in the Operating Partnership.

     Table of Contents  

The Operating Partnership conducts the Company s property management and development activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, CBL   Associates Management, Inc. (the  Management Company ), to comply with certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ). 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, they have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for these interim periods have been included.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The results for the interim period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for the full fiscal year. 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Note 2   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Accounting Guidance Adopted 
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ("ASU 2015-02").  The guidance modified the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminated the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affected the evaluation of fee arrangements and related party relationships in the primary beneficiary determination.  For public companies, ASU 2015-02 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those years using either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.  The adoption of ASU 2015-02 resulted in the identification of several VIEs as discussed in    Note 5    but did not alter any of the Company's consolidation conclusions.  The adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements other than the additional disclosures.         
  Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective 
  In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09").  The objective of this converged standard is to enable financial statement users to better understand and analyze revenue by replacing current transaction and industry-specific guidance with a more principles-based approach to revenue recognition.  The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.  ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other guidance such as lease and insurance contracts.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date  , ("ASU 2015-14") which allows an additional one year deferral of ASU 2014-09.  As a result, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years using one of two retrospective application methods.  Early adoption would be permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ("ASU 2016-08")  .   The guidance in ASU 2016-08 clarifies the implementation of ASU 2014-09 on principal versus agent consideration     and has the same effective date as ASU 2014-09, as deferred by ASU 2015-14.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , ASU 2016-11,   Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting,   and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.    These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as ASU 2014-09, as deferred by ASU 2015-14.  The Company is evaluating the impact that these updates may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and expects to adopt the guidance as of January 1, 2018.     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases     ("  ASU 2016-02").  The objective of ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms greater than 12 months.  The guidance applied by a lessor under ASU 2016-02 is substantially similar to existing GAAP.  For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  Lessees and lessors are required to use a modified retrospective transition method for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application.  Accordingly, they would apply the new accounting model for the earliest year presented in the financial statements.  A number of practical expedients may also be elected.  The Company is evaluating the impact that this update may have on its consolidated

     Table of Contents  

financial statements and related disclosures.  It is considering the practicality of adopting ASU 2016-02 concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09 as the standards overlap and concurrent adoption would align them if ASU 2016-02 was adopted as of January 1, 2018.  If early adoption is not practicable, the Company would adopt ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2019. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09").  ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.  For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and may be applied on a modified retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017 and is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13").  The objective of ASU 2016-13 is to provide financial statement users with information about expected credit losses on financial assets and other commitments to extend credit by a reporting entity.  The guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment model, which reflects credit events, with a current expected credit loss model, which recognizes an allowance for credit losses based on an entity's estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected.  For public companies that are SEC filers, ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis.  The Company expects to adopt ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020 and is evaluating the impact that this update may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15").  The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce diversity in practice in the classification of certain items in the statement of cash flows, including the classification of distributions received from equity method investees.  For public companies, ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis.  The Company expects to adopt ASU 2016-15 as of January 1, 2018 and does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Note 3   Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Company has categorized its financial assets and financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value into a hierarchy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure  , ("ASC 820") based on whether the inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.  The fair value hierarchy contains three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities as of the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2   Inputs, other than those included in Level 1, represent observable measurements for similar instruments in active markets, or identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and observable measurements or market data for instruments with substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
    
  Level 3   Inputs represent unobservable measurements, supported by little, if any, market activity, and require considerable assumptions that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.  Market valuations must often be determined using discounted cash flow methodologies, pricing models or similar techniques based on the Company s assumptions and best judgment. 
    
  The asset or liability's fair value within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability in an orderly transaction at the measurement date and under current market conditions.  Valuation techniques used maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and consider assumptions such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

The Company recognizes transfers in and out of every level at the end of each reporting period.  There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3 for any periods presented. 
  The Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate movements on its variable-rate debt.  The Company had   four   interest rate swaps as   December 31, 2015  , that qualified as hedging instruments and were designated as cash flow hedges.  The interest rate swaps were reflected in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The swaps met the effectiveness test criteria since inception and changes in their fair values were, thus, reported in other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI/L") and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged items affected earnings.  The fair values of the Company s interest rate hedges, classified under Level 2, were determined based on prevailing market data for contracts with matching durations, current and anticipated LIBOR information, consideration of the Company s credit standing, credit risk of the counterparties and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions.  See    Note 6    for further information regarding the Company s interest rate hedging instruments. 
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  Based on the interest rates for similar financial instruments, the carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  The estimated fair value of mortgage and other indebtedness was   $4,799,363   and   $4,945,622   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The fair value was calculated using Level 2 inputs by discounting future cash flows for mortgage and other indebtedness using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made currently.  The carrying amount of mortgage and other indebtedness was   $4,531,269   and   $4,710,628   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.     
  Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  The Company measures the fair value of certain long-lived assets on a nonrecurring basis, through quarterly impairment testing or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.   The Company considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in its impairment analysis of long-lived assets.  Significant quantitative factors include historical and forecasted information for each property such as net operating income ("NOI"), occupancy statistics and sales levels.  Significant qualitative factors used include market conditions, age and condition of the property and tenant mix.  Due to the significant unobservable estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of long-lived assets that experience impairment, the Company classifies such long-lived assets under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3 inputs primarily consist of sales and market data, independent valuations and discounted cash flow models as noted below.   
  The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and related impairment charges:

Long-lived Assets Measured at Fair Value in 2016 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized impairments of real estate of   $116,736   when it wrote down   nine   malls, an associated center, a community center,   three   office buildings and   three   outparcels to their estimated fair values.  The properties are classified for segment reporting purposes as listed below (see section below for information on outparcels).  See    Note 9    for segment information. 

(1) 
    The long-lived asset is measured at fair value and included in Net Investment in Real Estate Assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    The Company wrote down the book values of the   three   malls to their estimated fair value based  upon a sales price of   $32,250   in a signed contract with a third party buyer, adjusted to reflect disposition costs.  These malls are classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016.  The revenues of the malls accounted for approximately   1.5%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (3) 
    In accordance with the Company's quarterly impairment review process, the Company recorded impairment to write down the depreciated book value of   two   office buildings to their estimated fair value as of September 30, 2016 as a result of a change in the expected holding period for the buildings to a range of   1  -  2   years.  Other factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis at September 30, 2016 included a capitalization rate of   8.0%  , a discount rate of   10.0%   and estimated selling costs of   2.0%  .  The revenues of the office buildings accounted for approximately   0.1%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (4) 
    The office building was sold in September 2016.  A loss on impairment was recorded to adjust the book value to its net sales price.  See    Note 4    for more information. 
              (5) 
    In accordance with the Company's quarterly impairment review process, the Company recorded impairment to write down the depreciated book value of a community center to its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2016 as a result of a change in the expected holding period for the asset to a range of   1  -  2   years.  Other factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis at September 30, 2016 included a capitalization rate of   9.0%  , a discount rate of   10.75%   and estimated selling costs of   2.0%  .  The revenue of the community center accounted for approximately   0.1%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (6) 
    The Company adjusted the book value of the malls to their estimated fair value of   $65,447   based upon the sales price of   $66,500   in the signed contract with a third party buyer, adjusted to reflect disposition costs.  The revenues of The Lakes Mall and Fashion Square accounted for approximately   1.6%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2016.  These properties were sold in July 2016.  See    Note 4    for additional information. 
              (7) 
    In accordance with the Company's quarterly impairment review process, the Company recorded impairment to write down the depreciated book value of the mall to its estimated fair value as of June 30, 2016.  After evaluating redevelopment options, the Company determined that an appropriate risk-adjusted return was not achievable and reduced its holding period.  The mall is encumbered by a non-recourse loan with a balance of   $17,689   as of September 30, 2016 and has experienced declining sales and the loss of   two   anchor stores.  The revenues of Wausau Center accounted for approximately   0.3%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company notified the lender that it would not make its scheduled July 1, 2016 debt payment and the mall is in foreclosure.  See    Note 6   .  With the assistance of a third-party appraiser, management determined the fair value of Wausau Center using a discounted cash flow methodology as of June 30, 2016.  The discounted cash flow used assumptions including a   10  -year holding period with a sale at the end of the holding period, a capitalization rate of   13.25%   and a discount rate of   13.0%  .  As these assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties, they are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions used or management's estimates of future possible outcomes.

(8) 
    The Company adjusted the book value of Bonita Lakes Mall and Bonita Lakes Crossing ("Bonita Lakes") to its estimated fair value of   $27,440  , which represented the contractual sales price of   $27,910   with a third party buyer, adjusted to reflect disposition costs.  The revenues of Bonita Lakes accounted for approximately   0.7%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2016.  See    Note 4    for further information on the sale that closed in the second quarter of 2016. 
              (9) 
    The Company wrote down the mall to its estimated fair value as of March 31, 2016.  The fair value analysis used a discounted cash flow methodology with assumptions including a   10  -year holding period with a sale at the end of the holding period, a capitalization rate of   9.75%   and a discount rate of   11.5%  .  As these assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties, they are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions used or management's estimates of future possible outcomes.  The Company recognized an impairment upon the change in its plans to hold the investment.  The Company notified the lender that it would not pay off the loan that was scheduled to mature in August 2016 and the mall went into receivership in September 2016.  See    Note 6   .  The revenues of Midland Mall accounted for approximately   0.6%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2016.

The impairment loss includes a   $2,100   reserve for a roof and electrical work that the Company must fund in the future.  The revenues of River Ridge Mall accounted for approximately   0.6%   of total consolidated revenues for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2016.  The Company's investment in River Ridge is included in Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016.

  Variable Interest Entities

As a result, the Operating Partnership and certain of our subsidiaries are deemed to have the characteristics of a VIE primarily because the limited partners of these entities do not collectively possess substantive kick-out or participating rights.  However, the Company was not required to consolidate any previously unconsolidated entities or deconsolidate any previously consolidated entities as a result of the change in classification.  Accordingly, the adoption of ASU 2015-02 affected disclosure only and did not change amounts within the condensed consolidated financial statements.   
  The Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, which is a VIE, for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company, through the Operating Partnership, consolidates all VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary.  Generally, a VIE, is a legal entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.  A limited

partnership is considered a VIE when the majority of the limited partners unrelated to the general partner possess neither the right to remove the general partner without cause, nor certain rights to participate in the decisions that most significantly affect the financial results of the partnership.  In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of the Company's investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Company or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the business activities of the other investors.

  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Company retired a mortgage loan that was scheduled to mature in January 2017.  See    Note 16    for more information. 
  Scheduled Principal Payments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the scheduled principal amortization and balloon payments on all of the Company s consolidated mortgage and other indebtedness, excluding extensions available at the Company s option, are as follows:  

(1) 
    Excludes   $171,953   of maturities related to Midland Mall and Chesterfield Mall, which are in foreclosure.

The   $85,143   of scheduled principal payments in   2016   includes   $70,801   related to the maturing principal balance of the operating property loan secured by Greenbrier Mall and   $14,342   represents scheduled principal amortization.  The Company is in final negotiations with the lender to extend the maturity date of the loan secured by Greenbrier Mall. 
  The Company s mortgage and other indebtedness had a weighted-average maturity of   4.0   years as of   September 30, 2016   and   4.4   years as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Interest Rate Hedge Instruments 
  The Company records its derivative instruments in its condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the derivative has been designated as a hedge and, if so, whether the hedge has met the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.   
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as, and that qualify as, cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  Such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt. 
  The Company's outstanding interest rate derivatives, that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, matured on April 1, 2016.

Note 10   Equity and Capital 
  At-The-Market Equity Program 
  On March 1, 2013, the Company entered into separate controlled equity offering sales agreements (collectively, the "Sales Agreements") with a number of sales agents to sell shares of CBL's common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to   $300,000  , from time to time in "at-the-market" equity offerings (as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) or in negotiated transactions (the "ATM program").  In accordance with the Sales Agreements, the Company sets the parameters for the sales of shares, including the number of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are to be made and any minimum price below which sales may not be made.  The Sales Agreements provide that the sales agents are entitled to compensation for their services at a mutually agreed commission rate not to exceed   2.0%   of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares sold through the ATM program.  For each share of common stock issued by CBL, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding number of common units of limited partnership interest to CBL in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance.  The Company includes only share issuances that have settled in the calculation of shares outstanding at the end of each period. 
  The Company has not sold any shares under the ATM program since 2013.  Since the commencement of the ATM program, CBL has issued   8,419,298   shares of common stock, at a weighted-average sales price of   $25.12   per share, and approximately   $88,507   remains available that may be sold under this program as of   September 30, 2016  .  Actual future sales under this program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of CBL's common stock and the Company's capital needs.  The Company has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available under the ATM program.  
  Common Stock Repurchase Program 
  In July 2015, CBL's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program, which expired on August 31, 2016.  Under the program, the Company could purchase up to   $200,000   of CBL's common stock from time to time, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions.  The Company was not obligated to repurchase any shares of stock under the program.    No   shares were repurchased under this program prior to its expiration.  
   
  Note 11   Earnings per Share and Earnings per Unit 
  Earnings per Share of the Company 
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock for all potential dilutive common shares outstanding.  The limited partners  rights to convert their noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership into shares of common stock are not dilutive.  
  The following summarizes the impact of potential dilutive common shares on the denominator used to compute EPS:       

           (1) 
    Performance stock units are contingently issuable common shares and are included in earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.  See    Note 13    for a description of the long-term incentive program, which was adopted in 2015, that these units relate to.   
     Earnings per Unit of the Operating Partnership 
  Basic earnings per unit ( EPU ) is computed by dividing net income attributable to common unitholders by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPU assumes the issuance of common units for all potential dilutive common units outstanding.  
  The following summarizes the impact of potential dilutive common units on the denominator used to compute EPU:

Note 12   Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  The Company is currently involved in certain litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business, most of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance.  Management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters using the latest information available.  The Company records a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.  If an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range, the Company accrues the best estimate within the range.  If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount within the range.  If an unfavorable outcome is probable but the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the nature of the litigation and indicates that an estimate of the loss or range of loss cannot be made.  If an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and the estimated loss is material, the Company discloses the nature and estimate of the possible loss of the litigation.  Based on current expectations, such matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, business or financial condition of the Company. 
  On May 27, 2016, Tommy French filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of himself and all persons who purchased the Company's common stock between August 8, 2013 and May 24, 2016.    Two   additional suits were filed shortly thereafter with similar allegations.  On June 9, 2016, The Allan J. and Sherry R. Potts Living Trust filed a putative class action in the same Court on behalf of the trust and all persons who purchased the Company's common stock between August 8, 2013 and May 24, 2016, and on June 24, 2016, International Union of Painters   Allied Trades District Council No. 35 Pension Plan filed another putative class action in the same Court on behalf of itself and all persons who purchased the Company's common stock between August 9, 2011 and May 24, 2016, containing similar allegations.  On July 26, 2016, motions were submitted to the Court for the consolidation of these   three   cases, as well as for the appointment of a lead plaintiff.  On September 26, 2016, the Court granted the motion, consolidated the cases into one action, and appointed the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board as lead plaintiff and its counsel, Bernstein Liebhard, as lead counsel.  The Court granted the lead plaintiff 60 days to file a consolidated amended complaint, and once filed, the Company will file a response.  The previously filed complaints are all based on substantially similar allegations that certain of the Company s financing arrangements were obtained through fraud and/or misrepresentation, and that the Company and certain of its officers and directors made materially misleading statements to the market by failing to disclose material information concerning these alleged misrepresentations, and concerning the supposed involvement by insiders of the Company in alleged trading in the Company s stock by a United States senator on the basis of material nonpublic information.  Based on these allegations, these complaints assert claims for violation of the securities laws and seek a variety of relief, including unspecified monetary damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees.  The Company believes these complaints are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.  
  On July 29, 2016, Henry Shebitz filed a shareholder derivative suit in the Chancery Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee alleging that the Company's directors,   three   former directors and certain current and former officers breached their fiduciary duties by causing the Company to make materially misleading statements to the market by failing to disclose material information concerning these alleged misrepresentations, and concerning the supposed involvement by insiders of the Company in alleged trading in the Company s stock by a United States senator on the basis of material nonpublic information.  The complaint further alleges that certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors improperly engaged in transactions in the Company s stock while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the Company s alleged misleading statements.  The complaint purports to seek relief on behalf of the Company for unspecified damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees.  The Company believes that this complaint is without merit and intends to defend against it vigorously.     
  Environmental Contingencies 
  The Company evaluates potential loss contingencies related to environmental matters using the same criteria described above related to litigation matters.  Based on current information, an unfavorable outcome concerning such environmental matters, both individually and in the aggregate, is considered to be reasonably possible.  However, the Company believes its maximum potential exposure to loss would not be material to its results of operations or financial condition.  The Company has a master insurance policy that provides coverage through   2022   for certain environmental claims up to   $10,000   per occurrence and up to   $50,000   in the aggregate, subject to deductibles and certain exclusions.  At certain locations, individual policies are in place. 
  Guarantees 
  The Operating Partnership may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise.  This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment, and a higher return on the Operating Partnership s investment in the joint venture.  The Operating Partnership may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty.  Additionally, when the Operating Partnership issues a guaranty, the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that the Operating Partnership may receive indemnification from the joint venture partner or have the ability to increase its ownership interest.  The guarantees expire upon repayment of the debt, unless noted otherwise.

The following table represents the Operating Partnership's guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates' debt as reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Excludes any extension options. 
               (3) 
    The loan has a   one  -year extension option, which is at the unconsolidated affiliate's election, for an outside maturity date of February 2019. 
              (4) 
    The guaranty was removed in June 2016 when the construction loan was retired using proceeds from a non-recourse mortgage loan.  See    Note 5    for additional information. 
              (5) 
    The guaranty will be reduced to   50%   on March 1st of such year as payment-in-lieu of taxes ("PILOT") payments received and attributed to the prior calendar year by Ambassador Infrastructure and delivered to the lender are   $1,200   or more, provided no event of default exists. The guaranty will be reduced to   20%   when the PILOT payments are   $1,400   or more, provided no event of default exists.  
              (6) 
    The loan has   two     one  -year extension options, which are the unconsolidated affiliate's election, for an outside maturity date of December 2019. 
     The Company has guaranteed the lease performance of York Town Center, LP ("YTC"), an unconsolidated affiliate in which the Company owns a   50%   interest, under the terms of an agreement with a third party that owns property as part of York Town Center.  Under the terms of that agreement, YTC is obligated to cause performance of the third party s obligations as landlord under its lease with its sole tenant, including, but not limited to, provisions such as co-tenancy and exclusivity requirements.  Should YTC fail to cause performance, then the tenant under the third party landlord s lease may pursue certain remedies ranging from rights to terminate its lease to receiving reductions in rent.  The Company has guaranteed YTC s performance under this agreement up to a maximum of   $22,000  , which decreases by   $800   annually until the guaranteed amount is reduced to   $10,000  . The guaranty expires on December 31, 2020.  The maximum guaranteed obligation was   $14,800   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company entered into an agreement with its joint venture partner under which the joint venture partner has agreed to reimburse the Company   50%   of any amounts it is obligated to fund under the guaranty.  The Company did not include an obligation for this guaranty because it determined that the fair value of the guaranty was not material as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
  Performance Bonds 
  The Company has issued various bonds that it would have to satisfy in the event of non-performance.  The total amount outstanding on these bonds was   $14,274   and   $16,452   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
   
  Note 13   Share-Based Compensation 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   two   share-based compensation plans under which the Company has outstanding awards, the CBL   Associates Properties, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan ("the 2012 Plan") and the CBL   Associates Properties, Inc. Second Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan ("the 1993 Plan").  The Company can only make new awards under the 2012 Plan, which was approved by the Company's shareholders in May 2012.  The 2012 Plan permits the Company to issue stock options and common stock to selected officers, employees and non-employee directors of the Company up to a total of   10,400,000   shares.  The Company did not issue any new awards under the 1993 Plan, which was approved by the Company's shareholders in May 2003, between the adoption of the 2012 Plan to replace the 1993 Plan in May 2012 and the termination of the 1993 Plan (as to new awards) on May 5, 2013.  As the primary operating subsidiary of the Company, the Operating Partnership participates in and bears the compensation expense associated with the Company's share-based compensation plans.

     Table of Contents  

Restricted Stock Awards 
  The Company may make restricted stock awards to independent directors, officers and its employees under the 2012 Plan.  These awards are generally granted based on the performance of the Company and its employees.  None of these awards have performance requirements other than a service condition of continued employment, unless otherwise provided.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
  Share-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock awards was   $886   and   $692   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2,834   and   $3,615   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of real estate assets was   $83   and   $60   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $274   and   $213   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  A summary of the status of the Company s nonvested restricted stock awards as of   September 30, 2016  , and changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is presented below:  

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $7,622   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards granted under the plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.9   years.   
  Long-Term Incentive Program 
  In 2015, the Company adopted a long-term incentive program ("LTIP") for its named executive officers, which consists of performance stock unit ("PSU") awards and annual restricted stock awards, that may be issued under the 2012 Plan.  The number of shares related to the PSU awards that each named executive officer may receive upon the conclusion of a   three  -year performance period is determined based on the Company's achievement of specified levels of long-term total stockholder return ("TSR") performance relative to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") Retail Index, provided that at least a "Threshold" level must be attained for any shares to be earned.  Shares earned pursuant to the PSU awards vest   60%   at the conclusion of the performance period while the remaining   40%   of the PSU award vests   20%   on each of the first two anniversaries thereafter.   
  Annual Restricted Stock Awards 
  Under the LTIP, annual restricted stock awards consist of shares of time-vested restricted stock awarded based on a qualitative evaluation of the performance of the Company and the named executive officer during the fiscal year.  Annual restricted stock awards under the LTIP vest   20%   on the date of grant with the remainder vesting in   four   equal annual installments. 
  Performance Stock Units 
  The fair value of the PSU awards are estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo Simulation model.  The valuation consists of computing the fair value using CBL's simulated stock price as well as TSR over a   three  -year performance period.  The award is modeled as a contingent claim in that the expected return on the underlying shares is risk-free and the rate of discounting the payoff of the award is also risk-free. 
  In February 2016, the Company granted   282,995   PSUs at a grant-date fair value of   $4.98   per PSU.  In March 2015, the Company granted   138,680   PSUs at a grant-date fair value of   $15.52   per PSU.  
   Compensation cost is recognized on a tranche-by-tranche basis using the accelerated attribution method.  The resulting expense is recorded regardless of whether any PSU awards are earned as long as the required service period is met.  Share-based compensation expense related to the PSUs was   $258   and   $156   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.     Share-based compensation expense related to the PSUs was   $774   and   $468   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Unrecognized compensation costs related to the PSUs was   $2,163   as of   September 30, 2016  .

  Note 15   Income Taxes 
  The Company is qualified as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  To maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least   90%   of its taxable income to shareholders and meet certain other requirements. 
  As a REIT, the Company is generally not liable for federal corporate income taxes.  If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and it may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent years.  Even if the Company maintains its qualification as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.  State tax expense was   $700   and   $895   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2,724   and   $2,715   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Company has also elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for some of its subsidiaries.  This enables the Company to receive income and provide services that would otherwise be impermissible for REITs. For these entities, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided if the Company believes all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance resulting from changes in circumstances that may affect the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in income or expense, as applicable. 
  The Company recorded an income tax benefit (provision) as follows for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The Company had a net deferred tax asset of   $6,251   at   September 30, 2016   and a net deferred tax liability of   $672   at   December 31, 2015  .  The net deferred tax asset at   September 30, 2016   is included in intangible lease assets and other assets.  The net deferred tax liability at   December 31, 2015   is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  These balances primarily consisted of operating expense accruals and differences between book and tax depreciation.

The Company reports any income tax penalties attributable to its properties as property operating expenses and any corporate-related income tax penalties as general and administrative expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations.  In addition, any interest incurred on tax assessments is reported as interest expense.  The Company reported nominal interest and penalty amounts for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
   
  Note 16   Subsequent Events 
    In October 2016, the Company retired the operating property loan secured by Southaven Towne Center, which had a balance of   $38,314   at   September 30, 2016  , with borrowings on its lines of credit.  The loan was scheduled to mature in January 2017 and bore interest at a fixed-rate of   5.5%  .

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
  We are a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated REIT that is engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, leasing, management and operation of regional shopping malls, open-air and mixed-use centers, outlet centers, associated centers, community centers and office properties.  Our properties are located in   27   states, but are primarily in the southeastern and midwestern United States.  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
  We consolidate the financial statements of all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest or where we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in the following properties: 

(1) 
    Category consists of regional malls, open-air centers and outlet centers (including   one   mixed-use center). 
              (2) 
    Includes three malls that are classified as held for sale at   September 30, 2016  .  See    Note 4    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information. 
              (3) 
    Includes our two corporate office buildings. 
              (4) 
    We account for these investments using the equity method because one or more of the other partners have substantive participating rights. 
              (5) 
    Includes four office buildings that are classified as held for sale at   September 30, 2016  .  See    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
     At   September 30, 2016  , we had interests in the following properties under development:

We also hold options to acquire certain development properties owned by third parties.  
  Third quarter 2016 continued to showcase the positive results from our portfolio transformation and disposition program that we announced in our April 2014 investor call.  To date, we have closed or have in process 17 mall transactions, representing a value of over $700 million.  We have a binding contract to sell three malls for $32.3 million.  Although we experienced a net loss for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   due primarily to a $53.6 million loss on impairment, which was primarily to write down these three malls to their fair value, we are better positioned for long-term growth as the quality of our portfolio evolves.  The results of this process are evident as we note that back in 2014, approximately 22% of our total mall NOI was derived from Tier 3 malls, which we define as malls with sales of less than $300 per square foot.  In contrast, our Tier 3 malls currently represent only approximately 7% of our total mall NOI.  Ongoing expansions, redevelopments and select development projects also contribute to the strengthening of our portfolio.  We also sold two malls, a community center and an office building during the quarter.    
  We recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $10.2 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to net income of $26.3 million for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , which was primarily related to the loss on impairment discussed above.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had net income of $70.4 million compared to $92.0 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .   Same-center NOI (see below) grew 2.6% for the quarter driven by occupancy increases and higher base rents as well as savings in operating costs.  We realized a 1.8% increase in FFO, as adjusted, per diluted share (see below) to $0.57 per share for the quarter and an increase of 6.8% for the year-to-date period to $1.72 per share as compared to the prior-year period.   
  Leasing spreads for our stabilized malls were 10.2% for leases signed in the third quarter of 2016, including a 7.3% increase in renewal spreads, and new lease spreads were 19.7%.  For the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , same-center sales decreased 0.5% to $377 per square foot as compared to $379 per square foot in the prior-year period.  Occupancy for our total portfolio increased 110 basis points to 93.5% as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to 92.4% in the prior-year period while occupancy for our same-center malls improved by 90 basis points to 92.7% as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to 91.8% for the prior quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  Average annual base rents per square foot for our same-center malls increased to $32.06 compared to $31.41 in the prior-year period.

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Properties that were in operation for the entire year during   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are referred to as the  Comparable Properties.   Since January 1, 2015, we have opened two community center developments and acquired one mall as follows:

(1) 
    Ambassador Town Center is a 65/35 joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
     The properties listed above, with the exception of Ambassador Town Center, are included in our operations on a consolidated basis and are collectively referred to as the  New Properties.   The transactions related to the New Properties impact the comparison of the results of operations for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased   $10.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  Rental revenues and tenant reimbursements decreased by   $9.9 million   primarily due to a decrease of $10.3 million related to dispositions, which was partially offset by increases of $0.3 million from the Comparable Properties and $0.1 million related to the New Properties.  The $0.3 million increase in revenues at the Comparable Properties was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million at our core properties, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease related to non-core properties and those in redevelopment.  Positive leasing spreads and increases in base rents from occupancy gains contributed to the $0.9 million increase in revenues at our core properties. 
  Our cost recovery ratio for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was 98.1% compared with 100.8% for the prior-year period due to an increase in maintenance and repairs expense.   
  The increase of   $1.4 million   in management, development and leasing fees was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.7 million in management fees from new contracts to manage six malls and one community center for third parties, an increase of $0.5 million in development fees primarily related to a redevelopment project at CoolSprings Galleria, and a $0.3 million increase from financing fees related to the loan secured by Hamilton Place, which closed in June 2016. 
  Other revenues decreased   $2.5 million   primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses increased   $46.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  The increase was primarily due to impairment of real estate as described below.  Property operating expenses, including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs, decreased $1.1 million primarily due to a $2.2 million decrease attributable to dispositions, which was partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million related to the Comparable Properties.  The $1.1 million increase at the Comparable Properties was primarily driven by increases in bad debt expense and maintenance and repairs expense, which were partially offset by decreases in payroll and utilities expense. 
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of   $2.3 million   primarily resulted from a decrease of $2.6 million attributable to dispositions, which was partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million from the Comparable Properties.  The $0.6 million increase from the Comparable Properties includes an increase of $1.7 million attributable to our core properties, which was partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease related to non-core properties.  
  General and administrative expenses increased   $0.2 million  .  General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2016 include $0.7 million of non-recurring professional fees expense (which represent one-time expenses that are not part of our normal operations) related to the recently completed SEC investigation.  General and administrative expenses include $0.6 million and $0.3 million of expense related to litigation settlements in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  After considering the impact of these items, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $0.7 million primarily due to decreases in consulting and information technology expenses related to process and technology improvements completed in the prior-year period, which were partially offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses. 
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , we recognized impairments of real estate of   $53.6 million   to write down the book value of three malls, one community center and three office buildings.  In the second quarter of 2015, we recognized an impairment of real estate of   $0.9 million   which was primarily related to the sale of two outparcels.  See    Note 3    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.  
  Other expenses decreased   $3.2 million   due to $2.0 million of abandoned projects that were expensed in the prior-year quarter and a $1.2 million decrease in expenses related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties. 
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Interest expense decreased   $2.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  The $2.2 million decrease consists of $1.8 million attributable to the Comparable Properties and $0.4 million related to dispositions.  The $1.8 million decrease related to the Comparable Properties consists of a decrease of $3.2 million attributable to core properties, which was partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in accrued default interest related to three malls that are in foreclosure proceedings.  Interest expense related to property-level debt declined $2.9 million from the retirement of secured debt with borrowings from our lines of credit.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our corporate-level debt as our lines of credit and a new $350.0 million unsecured term loan entered into in the fourth quarter of 2015 were used to retire property-level debt. 
  The income tax benefit of   $2.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relates to the Management Company, which is a taxable REIT subsidiary, and consists of a current and deferred tax benefit of   $0.9 million   and   $1.5 million  .  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $0.4 million  , consisting of a current tax provision of less than   $0.7 million   and a deferred tax benefit of   $0.2 million  .  
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by   $7.0 million   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the prior-year period.  The increase is primarily due to the sale of High Pointe Commons, a community center owned in a 50/50 joint venture.  See    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.  
  In the   third   quarter of 2016, we recognized a   $4.9 million   gain on sales of real estate assets, primarily related to the sale of six outparcels.  We recognized a   $3.2 million   gain on sales of real estate assets in the   third   quarter of   2015   which consisted primarily of $2.8 million from the sale of an associated center and $0.4 million related to the sale of an outparcel. 
    
  Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased   $7.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  Rental revenues and tenant reimbursements decreased by   $5.3 million   primarily due to a decrease of $19.5 million related to dispositions, which was partially offset by increases of $7.9 million related to the Comparable Properties and $6.2 million attributable to the New Properties.  The $7.9 million increase in revenue at our Comparable Properties primarily consists of a $10.1 million increase related to our core properties partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million attributable to non-core properties.  Positive leasing spreads and increases in base rents from occupancy gains led to increases in minimum and percentage rents, while increases in occupancy and annual contractual increases contributed to the increase in tenant reimbursements leading to the $10.1 million increase at our core properties. 
  Our cost recovery ratio for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 100.1% compared with 99.6% for the prior-year period.

The increase of   $2.6 million   in management, development, financing and leasing fees for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million in management fees from new contracts to manage six malls and one community center for third parties, an increase of $1.0 million from financing fees related to the loans secured by Ambassador Town Center, Fremaux Town Center and Hamilton Place, which closed in June 2016, and an increase of $0.4 million in development fees. 
  Other revenues decreased   $4.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses increased   $108.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  The increase was primarily due to impairment of real estate as described below.  Property operating expenses, including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs, decreased $2.9 million primarily due to decreases of $5.1 million attributable to dispositions, partially offset by increases of $1.3 million related to the New Properties and $0.9 million attributable to the Comparable Properties.  The $0.9 million increase at our Comparable Properties was primarily driven by increases in bad debt expense, maintenance and repairs expense, and real estate taxes.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in payroll and related costs, marketing costs and utilities expense. 
  The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of   $1.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period resulted from decreases of  $4.3 million attributable to dispositions and $0.6 million related to the Comparable Properties, which were partially offset by an increase of $3.9 million related to the New Properties.  The $0.6 million decrease attributable to the Comparable Properties was due to a decrease of $2.1 million from our non-core properties, which was partially offset by increases of $1.3 million related to our core properties and $0.2 million attributable to developments.  
  General and administrative expenses increased   $0.4 million  .  General and administrative expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include $1.8 million of non-recurring professional fees expense (which represent one-time expenses that are not part of our normal operations) related to the recently completed SEC investigation and $2.3 million of expense related to litigation settlements.  After considering the impact of these items, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.7 million as compared to the prior-year period primarily due to decreases in consulting and information technology expenses related to process and technology improvements completed in the prior-year period, as well as a decrease in payroll and related expenses.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in travel expenses and a decrease in capitalized overhead related to development projects. 
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized impairments of real estate of   $116.7 million   to write down the book value of nine malls, an associated center, a community center, three office buildings and three outparcels.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized impairment of real estate of   $3.7 million  , of which $2.6 million related to the disposition of one mall in the second quarter of 2015, $0.9 million was from the sale of two outparcels and $0.2 million related to the sale of a building at a formerly owned mall.  See    Note 3    and    Note 4    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.  
  Other expenses decreased   $0.9 million   due to $2.1 million of abandoned projects that were expensed in the prior-year period, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in expenses related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties. 
  Other Income and Expenses 
  Interest and other income decreased   $5.2 million   compared to the prior-year period primarily due to $4.9 million received in the prior year as a partial settlement of a lawsuit. 
  Interest expense decreased   $11.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  The $11.7 million decrease consists of $10.9 million attributable to the Comparable Properties and $0.7 million related to dispositions.  The $10.9 million decrease related to the Comparable Properties primarily consists of a decrease of $12.2 million attributable to core properties, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in accrued default interest related to three malls that are in foreclosure proceedings.  Interest expense related to property-level debt declined $15.7 million from the retirement of secured debt with borrowings from our lines of credit and net proceeds from dispositions.  We also recognized a $1.2 million decrease in expense related to our interest rate swaps, which matured in April 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our corporate-level debt as our lines of credit and a new $350.0 million unsecured term loan entered into in the fourth quarter of 2015 were used to retire property-level debt. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $0.3 million   due to the early retirement of a mortgage loan.  
  We recorded a gain on investment of   $16.6 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   related to the sale of all of our available-for-sale securities.

The income tax benefit of   $3.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   relates to the Management Company, which is a taxable REIT subsidiary, and consists of a current and deferred tax benefit of   $1.2 million   and   $1.8 million  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $2.0 million  , consisting of a current tax provision of   $2.1 million   and a deferred tax benefit of   $0.1 million  .  
  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by   $95.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period.  The increase is primarily due to a gain of $29.2 million related to the foreclosure of Gulf Coast Town Center (owned in a 50/50 joint venture) million and $63.7 million from the sale of three unconsolidated affiliates in 2016.  See    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a   $14.5 million   gain on sales of real estate assets which consisted primarily of $12.3 million related to the sale of a community center and eight outparcels and $2.2 million related to a parking deck project.  We recognized an   $18.2 million   gain on sales of real estate assets during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   which consisted primarily of $16.3 million from the sale of two associated centers and $1.9 million associated with the sale of four outparcels. 
  Non-GAAP Measure 
  Same-center Net Operating Income 
  NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of our shopping centers and other properties.  We define NOI as property operating revenues (rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and other income) less property operating expenses (property operating, real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs).  
  We compute NOI based on the Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated properties.  We believe that presenting NOI and same-center NOI (described below) based on our Operating Partnership s pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated properties is useful since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership.  Our definition of NOI may be different than that used by other companies, and accordingly, our calculation of NOI may not be comparable to that of other companies. 
  Since NOI includes only those revenues and expenses related to the operations of our shopping center properties, we believe that same-center NOI provides a measure that reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, sales at the malls and operating costs and the impact of those trends on our results of operations.  Our calculation of same-center NOI excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, and amortization of above and below market lease intangibles in order to enhance the comparability of results from one period to another. 
  We include a property in our same-center pool when we have owned all or a portion of the property since January 1 of the preceding calendar year and it has been in operation for both the entire preceding calendar year and current year-to-date period.    New Properties are excluded from same-center NOI, until they meet this criteria.  Properties excluded from the same-center pool that would otherwise meet this criteria are properties which are being repositioned or properties where we are considering alternatives for repositioning, where we intend to renegotiate the terms of the debt secured by the related property or return the property to the lender and those in which we own a minority interest of 25% or less.  Lender properties consisted of Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center as of September 30, 2016.  Properties that we are currently repositioning are Cary Towne Center and Hickory Point Mall at   September 30, 2016  .  Properties in which we own a minority interest at   September 30, 2016   include Triangle Town Center, Triangle Town Place and River Ridge Mall.

Due to the exclusions noted above, same-center NOI should only be used as a supplemental measure of our performance and not as an alternative to GAAP operating income (loss) or net income (loss).  A reconciliation of our same-center NOI to net income for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Adjustments are based on our Operating Partnership's pro rata ownership share, including our share of unconsolidated affiliates and excluding noncontrolling interests' share of consolidated properties. 
     Same-center NOI increased 2.6% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year period.  The $4.4 million increase for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 consisted of a $3.5 million increase in revenue, primarily due to an increase in minimum rents as we realized benefits from rent growth and occupancy increases, and a $1.0 million decrease in operating expenses due to improved operating efficiency.  
  The 3.0% increase in same-center NOI for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year period included a $14.4 million increase in revenue, which included favorable variances of $11.6 million in minimum rents and $1.9 million in tenant reimbursements.  We also benefited from a $2.3 million decline in property operating costs due to savings from costs controls offset by $0.9 million in higher real estate taxes.   
   The growth in revenues for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven by increases of 2.1% in average annual base rents and 0.9% in occupancy in our same-center mall portfolio.  These increases were partially offset by a moderation in sales growth as we experienced a slight decrease of 0.5% in stabilized mall same-center sales per square foot for the rolling 12-month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  Holiday sales forecasts published by industry organizations, such as the National Retail Federation and International Council of Shopping Centers, generally project a positive holiday sales season leading us to be cautiously optimistic.

     Table of Contents  

Operational Review 
  The shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rents in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the malls earn most of their rents from short-term tenants during the holiday period.  Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year.  Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year. 
  We classify our regional malls into three categories: 
           (1) 
    Stabilized malls   Malls that have completed their initial lease-up and have been open for more than three complete calendar years. 
              (2) 
    Non-stabilized malls - Malls that are in their initial lease-up phase.  After three complete calendar years of operation, they are reclassified on January 1 of the fourth calendar year to the stabilized mall category.  The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta were classified as non-stabilized malls as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass, The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta and Fremaux Town Center were classified as non-stabilized malls as of   September 30, 2015  .  
              (3) 
    Excluded malls - We exclude malls from our core portfolio if they fall in the following categories, for which operational metrics are excluded: 
              a. 
    Lender Properties - Properties for which we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the property or convey the secured property to the lender.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center were classified as Lender Properties.  As of   September 30, 2015  , Gulf Coast Town Center, Triangle Town Center and Triangle Town Place were classified as Lender Properties.  In the first quarter of 2016, Triangle Town Center and Triangle Town Place were recategorized as Minority Interest Properties as described below.  In the second quarter of 2016, the foreclosure of Gulf Coast Town Center was complete.  Lender Properties are excluded from our same-center pool as decisions made while in discussions with the lender may lead to metrics that do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these properties or they may be under cash management agreements with the respective servicers. 
              b. 
    Repositioning Properties - Properties that are currently being repositioned or where we have determined that the current format of the property no longer represents the best use of the property and we are in the process of evaluating alternative strategies for the property.  This may include major redevelopment or an alternative retail or non-retail format, or after evaluating alternative strategies for the property, we may determine that the property no longer meets our criteria for long-term investment.  The steps taken to reposition these properties, such as signing tenants to short-term leases, which are not included in occupancy percentages, or leasing to regional or local tenants, which typically do not report sales, may lead to metrics which do not provide relevant information related to the condition of these properties.  Therefore, traditional performance measures, such as occupancy percentages and leasing metrics, exclude Repositioning Properties.  Cary Towne Center and Hickory Point are classified as Repositioning Properties as of   September 30, 2016  .  Chesterfield Mall and Wausau Center were categorized as Repositioning Properties as of   September 30, 2015  .  Chesterfield Mall was reclassified to the Lender Property category as of March 31, 2016.  Wausau Center was moved from Repositioning to the Lender Property category as of June 30, 2016 when it was determined after evaluating redevelopment options that an appropriate risk-adjusted return was not achievable and the mall should be returned to the lender. 
              c. 
    Minority Interest Properties - Properties in which we have a 25% or less ownership interest.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had two malls and an associated center in the Minority Interest Property category.  Triangle Town Center and Triangle Town Place were reclassified from the Lender Property category in February 2016 upon the Company's sale of its 50% interest in these properties to a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a 10% ownership interest.  The associated debt on these properties was restructured in conjunction with the sale.  The Company also sold a 75% interest in River Ridge Mall to a new joint venture in March 2016.  See    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on these unconsolidated affiliates.

We derive the majority of our revenues from the mall properties.  The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows:  

Mall Store Sales 
  Mall store sales include reporting mall tenants of 10,000 square feet or less for stabilized malls and exclude license agreements, which are retail contracts that are temporary or short-term in nature and generally last more than three months but less than twelve months.  Stabilized Mall store sales for the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   on a comparable center basis decreased approximately   0.5%   to $377 per square foot compared to $379 per square foot for the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in sales was primarily driven by large declines generated by two properties located in energy markets, which offset sales growth in other markets.  
  Occupancy 
  Our portfolio occupancy is summarized in the following table    (1)   :

    As noted above, excluded properties are not included in occupancy metrics. 
              (2) 
    Represents occupancy for The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta as of   September 30, 2016   and occupancy for The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass, The Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta and Fremaux Town Center as of   September 30, 2015  .  Fremaux Town Center was classified as a community center as of March 31, 2016. 
     Leasing 
  The following is a summary of the total square feet of leases signed in the three and   nine   month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior-year period: 

Year-to-date leasing activity is up 2.1% as compared to the prior-year period.  The 37.9% decrease in leases signed during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is a timing difference as we signed 67.0% more leases in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year.  We have finalized our negotiations with the new owners of Aeropostale and after closing several stores, we ended the third quarter with 58 stores.  In January 2017, an additional 9 stores will close and rents at certain locations will be reduced.  We estimate the gross rent impact in 2017 from these additional store closures and lease modifications will approximate $3.0 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $439.0 million   outstanding on our three unsecured credit facilities leaving approximately   $661.0 million   of availability.  Our borrowing rate continues to improve as we refinance maturing loans at lower interest rates.  We have also used proceeds realized from dispositions to reduce balances on our credit lines, which had been used to retire secured property-level debt.  In the third quarter of 2016, we retired the $51.6 million loan secured by Dakota Square Mall with borrowings from our lines of credit and the $38.2 million loan secured by Fashion Square was assumed by the buyer in conjunction with the sale of the mall.  We also retired two loans secured by unconsolidated properties, of which our pro rata share of the debt aggregated to $16.6 million and had a weighted-average interest rate of 6.25%.  In addition to realizing a gain of $8.4 million from the sale of High Pointe Commons, a 50/50 joint venture, we used a portion of the proceeds to retire $17.4 million of debt at our share.  Total pro rata debt has decreased by $460 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior-year period as a result of our continued efforts to deleverage our balance sheet. We anticipate further improvement of   $189.6 million   when the three malls in receivership are returned to the respective lenders in satisfaction of the non-recourse debt.  We are also in negotiations with the lender to extend the maturity of the $70.8 million loan secured by Greenbrier Mall.  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we used availability on our credit facilities to retire the   $38.3 million   loan secured by Southaven Towne Center, which was scheduled to mature in January 2017 and had an interest rate of   5.5%  .  Our priorities are to continue the progress we have made to enhance our credit metrics, grow EBITDA and reduce debt.  We have also made significant progress in growing and improving the quality of our unencumbered pool of assets.  As we have retired secured loans by utilizing unsecured borrowings and disposition proceeds, our consolidated unencumbered  NOI has increased to 48% of our total consolidated NOI as of September 30, 2016 from 29% as of December 31, 2013. 
  We derive a majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants, which have historically been the primary source for funding short-term liquidity and capital needs such as operating expenses, debt service, tenant construction allowances, recurring capital expenditures, dividends and distributions.  We believe that the combination of cash flows generated from our operations, combined with our debt and equity sources and the availability under our credit facilities and proceeds from dispositions will, for the foreseeable future, provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash needs.  In addition to these factors, we have options available to us to generate additional liquidity, including but not limited to, debt and equity offerings, joint venture investments, issuances of noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership, and decreasing expenditures related to tenant construction allowances and other capital expenditures.  We also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at our properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an optimal value for the assets. 
  Cash Flows - Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
  There was   $24.5 million   of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $12.4 million   from   December 31, 2015  .  Our net cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by operating activities decreased   $20.3 million   primarily due to decreases in cash flows from dispositions and timing differences related to working capital items as compared to the prior-year period.  These decreases were partially offset by cash flows from the growth in same-center NOI, cash flows from New Properties and lower cash paid for interest as we continued our strategy of retiring higher-rate secured debt with lower-rate unsecured debt. 
  Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  Cash flows used in investing activities was   $4.3 million  , representing a   $295.3 million   difference as compared to cash used in investing activities of   $299.6 million   during the prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Mayfaire Town Center in the prior-year period, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of several consolidated and unconsolidated properties in the current year. 
     Cash Used in Financing Activities 
    Cash flows used in financing activities increased by   $281.9 million   as we used proceeds from sales of consolidated and unconsolidated properties to reduce borrowings on our lines of credit.  Additionally, the prior year period included borrowings of $192.0 million to acquire Mayfaire Town Center.

Debt 
  Debt of the Company  
  CBL has no indebtedness.  Either the Operating Partnership or one of its consolidated subsidiaries, that it has a direct or indirect ownership interest in, is the borrower on all of our debt.  CBL is a limited guarantor of the Notes, issued by the Operating Partnership in November 2013 and October 2014, respectively, for losses suffered solely by reason of fraud or willful misrepresentation by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates.  We also provide a similar limited guarantee of the Operating Partnership's obligations with respect to our unsecured credit facilities and three unsecured term loans as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Debt of the Operating Partnership 
  The following tables summarize debt based on our pro rata ownership share, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated affiliates and excluding noncontrolling investors  share of consolidated properties, because we believe this provides investors and lenders a clearer understanding of our total debt obligations and liquidity (in thousands):

    We had   four   interest rate swaps with notional amounts outstanding totaling   $101,151   as of   December 31, 2015   related to   four   of our variable-rate loans on consolidated operating properties to effectively fix the interest rates on these loans.  Therefore, these amounts are reflected in fixed-rate debt at   December 31, 2015  .  The swaps matured April 1, 2016.  We have two interest rate swaps with notional amounts outstanding totaling   $120,045   as of   September 30, 2016   related to two of our variable-rate loans on unconsolidated operating properties to effectively fix the interest rates on these loans.  Therefore, there amounts are reflected in fixed-rate debt at   September 30, 2016  . 
       As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $242.8 million   of consolidated debt is scheduled to mature in 2016, which represents three loans secured by wholly owned malls.  We are in final negotiations with the lender to restructure and extend the maturity date on the   $70.8 million   loan secured by Greenbrier Mall.  The   $172.0 million   aggregate remaining balance relates to the loans secured by Midland Mall and Chesterfield Mall, which we plan to return to the respective lenders as part of the foreclosure process.  The   $17.7 million   loan secured by Wausau Center, which is scheduled to mature in 2021, is also in foreclosure. 
  The weighted-average remaining term of our total share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt was 3.9 years and 4.1 years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The weighted-average remaining term of our pro rata share of fixed-rate debt was 4.3 years and 4.5 years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our pro rata share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt represented 27.1% and   25.3%  , respectively, of our total pro rata share of debt.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt represented 16.9% of our total market capitalization (see   Equity   below) as compared to 16.1% as of   December 31, 2015  .  The increase is due to the decline in our stock price from $12.37 at December 31, 2015 to $12.14 at   September 30, 2016  . 
  See    Note 6    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the amount and terms of our outstanding indebtedness and compliance with applicable covenants and restrictions as of   September 30, 2016  .

     Other 
  The non-recourse loans secured by Chesterfield Mall, Midland Mall and Wausau Center are in default and in receivership at   September 30, 2016  .  The malls generate insufficient income levels to cover the debt service on the mortgages, which had an aggregate balance of   $189.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company plans to return these malls to the respective lenders when foreclosure proceedings are complete, which is estimated to be by year-end or in early 2017. 
  JG Gulf Coast Town Center LLC - Phases I and II 
  In June 2016, the foreclosure process was complete and the mortgage lender received title to the mall in satisfaction of the non-recourse mortgage loan secured by Phases I and II of Gulf Coast Town Center in Ft. Myers, FL.  Gulf Coast Town Center generated insufficient cash flow to cover the debt service on the mortgage, which had a balance of   $190.8 million   (of which our   50.0%   share was   $95.4 million  ) and a contractual maturity date of July 2017.  In the third quarter of 2015, the lender on the loan began receiving the net operating cash flows of the property each month in lieu of scheduled monthly mortgage payments.  We recognized a gain on the net investment in Gulf Coast of   $29.3 million  , which is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Future dividends payable will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon circumstances at the time of declaration. 
  As a publicly traded company and, as a subsidiary of a publicly traded company, we have access to capital through both the public equity and debt markets.  We currently have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC authorizing us to publicly issue senior and/or subordinated debt securities, shares of preferred stock (or depositary shares representing fractional interests therein), shares of common stock, warrants or rights to purchase any of the foregoing securities, and units consisting of two or more of these classes or series of securities and limited guarantees of debt securities issued by the Operating Partnership.  Pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the Operating Partnership is also authorized to publicly issue unsubordinated debt securities.  There is no limit to the offering price or number of securities that we may issue under this shelf registration statement. 
  At-The-Market Equity Program 
  On March 1, 2013, we entered into Sales Agreements with a number of sales agents to sell shares of CBL's common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $300.0 million, from time to time through an ATM program.  In accordance with the Sales Agreements, we set the parameters for the sales of shares, including the number of shares to be issued, the time period during which sales are to be made and any minimum price below which sales may not be made.  The Sales Agreements provide that the sales agents are entitled to compensation for their services at a mutually agreed commission rate not to exceed 2.0% of the gross proceeds from the sales of shares sold through the ATM program.  For each share of common stock issued by CBL, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding number of common units of limited partnership interest to CBL in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance.  We include only share issuances that have settled in our calculation of shares outstanding at the end of each period. 
  We have not sold any shares under the ATM program since 2013.  The net proceeds from the ATM sales were used to reduce the balances on our credit facilities.  Since the commencement of the ATM program, CBL has issued   8,419,298   shares of common stock, at a weighted-average sales price of   $25.12   per share, and approximately   $88.5 million   remains available that may be sold under this program.  Actual future sales under this program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including but not

limited to market conditions, the trading price of CBL's common stock and our capital needs.  We have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available under the ATM program.  
  Common Stock Repurchase Program 
  In July 2015, CBL's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program, which expired on August 31, 2016.  Under the program, we could purchase up to   $200.0 million   of CBL's common stock from time to time, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions.  We were not obligated to repurchase any shares of stock under the program.  No shares were repurchased under this program prior to its expiration.  
  Debt-To-Total Market Capitalization 
  Our strategy is to maintain a conservative debt-to-total-market capitalization ratio in order to enhance our access to the broadest range of capital markets, both public and private.  Based on our share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt and the market value of equity, our debt-to-total-market capitalization (debt plus market value of equity) ratio was   62.3%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 61.9% at   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in the debt-to-market capitalization ratio is primarily due to a decrease in CBL's stock price to $12.14 at   September 30, 2016   from $13.75 at   September 30, 2015  .  Our debt-to-market capitalization ratio at   September 30, 2016   was computed as follows (in thousands, except stock prices):  

(1) 
    Stock price for common stock and Operating Partnership units equals the closing price of CBL's common stock on   September 30, 2016  .  The stock prices for the preferred stock represent the liquidation preference of each respective series of preferred stock. 
     Covenants and Restrictions 
  The agreements for the unsecured lines of credit, the Notes and unsecured term loans contain, among other restrictions, certain financial covenants including the maintenance of certain financial coverage ratios, minimum unencumbered asset and interest ratios, maximum secured indebtedness ratios, maximum total indebtedness ratios and limitations on cash flow distributions.  We   believe we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions at   September 30, 2016

The agreements for the Notes described above contain default provisions customary for transactions of this nature (with applicable customary grace periods). Additionally, any default in the payment of any recourse indebtedness greater than or equal to   $50.0 million   of the Operating Partnership will constitute an event of default under the Notes.  
  Capital Expenditures 
  Deferred maintenance expenditures are generally billed to tenants as common area maintenance expense, and most are recovered over a 5 to 15-year period.  Renovation expenditures are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls, of which a portion is recovered from tenants over a 5 to 15-year period.  We recover these costs through fixed amounts with annual increases or pro rata cost reimbursements based on the tenant s occupied space.   
  The following table, which excludes expenditures for developments and expansions, summarizes these capital expenditures, including our share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures, for the three and   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Tenant allowances primarily relate to new leases.  Tenant allowances related to renewal leases were not material for the periods presented. 
          
  Our total investment in renovations that are scheduled for 2016 is projected to be $15.0 million, which includes approximately $7.0 million, at our share, of a $13.8 million renovation at CoolSprings Galleria in Nashville, TN as well as other eco-friendly green renovations.  Annual capital expenditures budgets are prepared for each of our properties that are intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures.  We believe that property operating cash flows, which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses, will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures. 
  Developments and Expansions 
  Since 2013, we have completed or have under construction over 20 redevelopment projects which represent an investment of approximately $250 million at our share with an average return of 8.5%.

Construction continues on The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo, our 65/35 joint venture with Horizon.  The leasing is nearing 80% and includes tenants such as Michael Kors, Brooks Brothers, Nike, Under Armour and Puma.  
  We began construction in the third quarter on several redevelopments.  These include the addition of T. J. Maxx at Hickory Point Mall and a Planet Fitness that will open by year-end at East Towne Mall.   
  Additionally, anchor redevelopment projects are under construction at several malls.  These projects involve former department stores, which afford us the opportunity to revitalize these spaces with a new mix of tenants and enhance the value of our properties.  We proactively negotiated a lease termination last year to obtain the former JC Penney space at College Square.  We are replacing a former Shopko with a Dunham's Sporting Goods store at Northpark Mall and redeveloping the former JC Penney at York Galleria, which will include Gold's Gym, H M and additional stores and restaurants. 
  We own land and hold options to acquire certain development properties owned by third parties.  Except for the projects presented above, we do not have any other material capital commitments as of   September 30, 2016  .     
  Acquisitions and Dispositions 
  See    Note 4    and    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of our acquisition and disposition activity related to consolidated and unconsolidated affiliates.     
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Unconsolidated Affiliates 
  We have ownership interests in   17   unconsolidated affiliates as of   September 30, 2016   that are described in    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  The unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as  Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.   The following are circumstances when we may consider entering into a joint venture with a third party: 
             
    Third parties may approach us with opportunities in which they have obtained land and performed some pre-development activities, but they may not have sufficient access to the capital resources or the development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition.  We enter into such arrangements when we determine such a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return on our investment.  We typically earn development fees from the joint venture and provide management and leasing services to the property for a fee once the property is placed in operation. 
                
    We determine that we may have the opportunity to capitalize on the value we have created in a property by selling an interest in the property to a third party.  This provides us with an additional source of capital that can be used to develop or acquire additional real estate assets that we believe will provide greater potential for growth.  When we retain an interest in an asset rather than selling a 100% interest, it is typically because this allows us to continue to manage the property, which provides us the ability to earn fees for management, leasing, development and financing services provided to the joint venture. 
     Guarantees 
  We may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise.  This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment, and a higher return on our investment in the joint venture.  We may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty.  Additionally, when we issue a guaranty, the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture or have the ability to increase our ownership interest.

The following table represents our guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates' debt as reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Excludes any extension options. 
              (2) 
    The guaranty was reduced from 25% to 20% when the loan was modified and extended in February 2016.  See    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
              (3) 
    The loan has a   one  -year extension option, which is at the unconsolidated affiliate's election, for an outside maturity date of February 2019. 
              (4) 
    The guaranty was removed in June 2016 when the construction loan was retired using proceeds from a non-recourse mortgage loan.  See    Note 5    to the condensed consolidated financial statements or additional information. 
              (5) 
    The guaranty will be reduced to   50%   on March 1st of such year as PILOT payments received and attributed to the prior calendar year by Ambassador Infrastructure and delivered to the lender are   $1,200   or more, provided no event of default exists.  The guaranty will be reduced to   20%   when the PILOT payments are   $1,400   or more, provided no event of default exists.  
              (6) 
    The loan has two one-year extension options, which are the unconsolidated affiliate's election, for an outside maturity date of December 2019. 
       We have guaranteed the lease performance of YTC, an unconsolidated affiliate in which we own a   50%   interest, under the terms of an agreement with a third party that owns property as part of York Town Center.  Under the terms of that agreement, YTC is obligated to cause performance of the third party s obligations as landlord under its lease with its sole tenant, including, but not limited to, provisions such as co-tenancy and exclusivity requirements.  Should YTC fail to cause performance, then the tenant under the third party landlord s lease may pursue certain remedies ranging from rights to terminate its lease to receiving reductions in rent.  We have guaranteed YTC s performance under this agreement up to a maximum of   $22.0 million  , which decreases by   $0.8 million   annually until the guaranteed amount is reduced to   $10.0 million  .  The guaranty expires on December 31, 2020.  The maximum guaranteed obligation was   $14.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  We entered into an agreement with our joint venture partner under which the joint venture partner has agreed to reimburse us   50%   of any amounts we are obligated to fund under the guaranty.  We did not include an obligation for this guaranty because we determined that the fair value of the guaranty was not material as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .         
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures.  Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.  We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section.   
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  See    Note 2    to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
  Impact of Inflation and Deflation 
  Deflation can result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit.  The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand.  Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or refinancings for our properties and our tenants  ability to obtain credit.  Decreases in consumer demand can have a direct impact on our tenants and the rents we receive. 
  During inflationary periods, substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation.  These provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants' gross sales, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases.  In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and/or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate.  Most of the leases require the tenants to pay a fixed amount, subject to annual increases, for their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and certain capital expenditures, which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. 
  Non-GAAP Measure 
  Funds from Operations 
  FFO is a widely used non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP.  NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests.  Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis.  We define FFO as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock of the Company or distributions on preferred units of the Operating Partnership, as applicable.  Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 
  We believe that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time.  Since values of well-maintained real estate assets have historically risen with market conditions, we believe that FFO enhances investors  understanding of our operating performance.  The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our properties and interest rates, but also by our capital structure. 
  We present both FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders and FFO allocable to common shareholders, as we believe that both are useful performance measures.  We believe FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is a useful performance measure since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Operating Partnership.  We believe FFO allocable to common shareholders is a useful performance measure because it is the performance measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. 
  In our reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders that is presented below, we make an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of our Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders.  We then apply a percentage to FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders to arrive at FFO allocable to common shareholders.  The percentage is computed by taking the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and dividing it by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares and the weighted-average number of Operating Partnership units held by noncontrolling interests during the period.      
  FFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. 
  FFO, as adjusted, for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   grew 1.8% and 6.8%, respectively, to $0.57 and $1.72 per share compared to the prior-year periods.  The increase in FFO, as adjusted, for the three and nine month periods  
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to rent growth and occupancy increases in the same-center pool as well as contributions from new developments and interest rate savings.  This growth was partially offset by dilution from asset sales completed year-to-date. 
  FFO, as adjusted, during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , excludes $0.7 million of nonrecurring professional fees expense, $0.6 million of litigation expense, $1.1 million of equity in losses from the disposals of unconsolidated affiliates and $1.4 million of non-cash default interest expense.  Additionally, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized a $54.5 million increase in equity earnings, of which $27.9 million related to the foreclosure of the loan secured by Gulf Coast Town Center and $26.4 million related to the sale of our 50% interest in Triangle Town Center; $2.3 million of litigation expense and $1.8 million of nonrecurring professional fees expense. During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized $0.3 million of expense related to a litigation settlement and a $0.3 million gain on extinguishment of debt.  Additionally, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   we recognized a $16.6 million gain on investment related to the sale of marketable securities, a $0.3 million gain on extinguishment of debt and received income of $1.3 million, net of related expense, as a partial settlement of ongoing litigation.  Considering the significance and nature of these items, we believe it is important to identify the impact of these changes on our FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of our results of operations.  Therefore, we have also presented FFO, as adjusted, excluding these items. 
  The reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is as follows (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Litigation settlement income is included in Interest and Other Income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Litigation expense, including settlements paid, is included in General and Administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Nonrecurring professional fees expense is included in General and Administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ITEM 3:    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are exposed to various market risk exposures, including interest rate risk.  The following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties.  Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in interest rates.  Caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below, as actual results may differ.  We employ various derivative programs to manage certain portions of our market risk associated with interest rates.  See    Note 6    of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk, including derivative financial instrument activity. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Based on our proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt at   September 30, 2016  , a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates on variable-rate debt would decrease or increase annual cash flows by approximately $6.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and increase or decrease annual interest expense, after the effect of capitalized interest, by approximately $6.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively. 
    
  Based on our proportionate share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt at   September 30, 2016  , a 0.5% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $77.3 million, while a 0.5% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $80.4 million.

ITEM 4:    Controls and Procedures 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
       As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's and the Operating Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's and the Operating Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information that the Company and the Operating Partnership are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and to ensure that information we are required to disclose is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
       There have been no changes in the Company's or the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1:    Legal Proceedings 
  We are currently involved in certain litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business, most of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance.  Based on current expectations, such matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, business or financial condition.   
  On May 27, 2016, Tommy French filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of himself and all persons who purchased our common stock between August 8, 2013 and May 24, 2016.  Two additional suits were filed shortly thereafter with similar allegations.  On June 9, 2016, The Allan J. and Sherry R. Potts Living Trust filed a putative class action in the same Court on behalf of the trust and all persons who purchased our common stock between August 8, 2013 and May 24, 2016, and on June 24, 2016, International Union of Painters   Allied Trades District Council No. 35 Pension Plan filed another putative class action in the same Court on behalf of itself and all persons who purchased our common stock between August 9, 2011 and May 24, 2016, containing similar allegations.  On July 26, 2016, motions were submitted to the Court for the consolidation of these three cases, as well as for the appointment of a lead plaintiff.  On September 26, 2016, the Court granted the motion, consolidated the cases into one action, and appointed the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board as lead plaintiff and its counsel, Bernstein Liebhard, as lead counsel.  The Court granted the lead plaintiff 60 days to file a consolidated amended complaint, and once filed, the Company will file a response.  The previously filed complaints are all based on substantially similar allegations that certain of the Company s financing arrangements were obtained through fraud and/or misrepresentation, and that we and certain of our officers and directors made materially misleading statements to the market by failing to disclose material information concerning these alleged misrepresentations, and concerning the supposed involvement by insiders of the Company in alleged trading in the Company s stock by a United States senator on the basis of material nonpublic information.  Based on these allegations, these complaints assert claims for violation of the securities laws and seek a variety of relief, including unspecified monetary damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees. We believe these complaints are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.  
  On July 29, 2016, Henry Shebitz filed a shareholder derivative suit in the Chancery Court for Hamilton County, Tennessee alleging that our directors, three former directors and certain current and former officers breached their fiduciary duties by causing us to make materially misleading statements to the market by failing to disclose material information concerning these alleged misrepresentations, and concerning the supposed involvement by insiders of the Company in alleged trading in the Company s stock by a United States senator on the basis of material nonpublic information.  The complaint further alleges that certain of our current and former officers and directors improperly engaged in transactions in the Company s stock while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the Company s alleged misleading statements.  The complaint purports to seek relief on behalf of us for unspecified damages as well as costs and attorneys  fees. We believe that this complaint is without merit and intends to defend against it vigorously.
