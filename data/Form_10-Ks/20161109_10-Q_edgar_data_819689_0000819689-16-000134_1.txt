Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

1.  Ba    sis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements (the "financial statements") include the accounts of Arrhythmia Research Technology, Inc.      ( ART ) and its subsidiary, Micron Products, Inc.      ("Micron" and together with ART, the  Company ). ART   discontinued operations of its   wholly-owned Pennsylvania subsidiary, RMDDxUSA Corp. ( RMDDxUSA ) and that subsidiary s Prince Edward Island subsidiary, RMDDx Corporation ( RMDDx  and collectively with RMDDxUSA, WirelessDx )   in the third quarter of 2012.  In May 2014,   RMDDxUSA   filed for bankruptcy and the Chapter 7 discharge order was issued on March 20, 2015 and the case was   closed   (see Note 10)  .     The WirelessDx results are presented herein as discontinued operations.    All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in complete financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  These financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on   March 10, 2016  .   

The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The Company's balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  

The information presented reflects, in the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

2.  Earnings per Share ("EPS") 

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the average number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.  In addition, the numerator is adjusted for any changes in net income (loss) that would result from the assumed conversions of those potential shares.        For the   three   and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   all shares are anti-dilutive.  For this reason the EPS table has been removed. 

3.  Inventories 

Inventories consist of the following: 

Silver included in raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventory had an estimated cost of   $607,700   and   $313,738   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.    

In the third quarter the Company entered into   multi-year   agreements with   certain   offshore customers resulting in increased inventory as of September 30, 2016.

4.    Property, Plant and Equipment, n  et 

Property, plant and equipment  , net   consist of the following: 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded depreciation expense of   $406,122   and   $371,606  , respectively.      For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded depreciation expense of   $1,150,683   and   $1,099,632  , respectively.  

On   December 4, 2015  , the Company entered into a Letter of Intent to sell its   two   unoccupied buildings, with a total of approximately   52,000   square feet  , and land, at its Fitchburg, Massachusetts campus.  On   January 13, 2016  , the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell these two buildings which have been classified as Assets Held for Sale at   September   30  , 2016 and   December 31, 2015  . The carrying value of the properties (  $665,000  ) approximated the fair value less the cost to sell.   The Company originally expected the sale of the properties to be completed by the end of 2016; however, due to ongoing renegotiations, the Company now expects the sale to occur by the end of 2017.  The Company does not expect any material impact on the statement of operations.   

5.  Intangible Assets, net 

The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. For the   nine   months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015,   the Company recorded impairment charges of $0 and $118,318, respectively.       

Intangible assets consist of the following: 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded amortization expense of   $439   and   $808  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded amortization expense of   $1,318   and   $2,796  ,   respectively.

Other Debt 

Equipment notes 

In January 2013, the Company entered into   two   equipment notes totaling   $272,500   with a financing company to acquire production equipment. The notes bear interest at the fixed rate of   4.66%   and require monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately   $5,000   over a   five   year term maturing in January 2018. 

Subordinated promissory notes 

In December 2013, the Company completed a private offering in which the Company sold an aggregate of   $500,000   in subordinated promissory notes. The notes are unsecured and require quarterly interest-only payments at a rate of   10%   per annum for the first two years, increasing to   12%   per annum in December 2015. The notes mature in December 2016 at which point the outstanding balance is due in full. The subordinated promissory notes may be prepaid by the Company at any time following the first anniversary thereof without penalty. The notes are subordinated to all indebtedness of the Company pursuant to the bank credit facility. 

In connection with the subordinated promissory notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase the Company's common stock at   $3.51   per share. The warrants expire in December 2016. The proceeds were allocated between the notes and warrants on a relative fair value basis resulting in   $416,950   allocated to the notes and   $83,050   allocated to the warrants as part of Additional-Paid-in-Capital. The total discount on the notes is being recognized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the notes. The Company recorded   $6,921   and   $20,763   for   the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount. The unamortized discount which is net against the outstanding balance of the subordinated promissory notes is   $6,102   at   September 30, 2016   and   $26,865   at   December 31, 2015  . 

In October 2016, certain of these promissory notes and the unexercised warrants were amended to extend their maturity dates to December 2018 (Note 11). 

7.  Income Taxes 

No provision for income taxes has been recorded in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, respectively.    The Company has a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    

The Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards totaling   $8,439,000   and   $8,150,000  , respectively, which begin to expi  re in 2030. The Company also has   federal and state tax credit carryovers of   $303,000   and   $340,000   respectively. The federal and state tax credits   begin to expire in 202  9   and 2016  , respectively.  

8.  Commitments and Contingencies

The warrants expire in December 2016.   In October 2016, the unexercised warrants were amended to extend their maturity dates to December 2018 (Note 11). 

10.  Discontinued Operations 

The Company's subsidiary, RMDDxUSA Corp. and its Prince Edward Island subsidiary RMDDx Corporation (collectively "WirelessDx"), discontinued operations   in   2012, filed for relief under Chapter 7 (Liquidation) of the United States Bankruptcy Code in 2014 and on March 20, 2015, the Chapter 7 Order was formally discharged and the case was closed. 

For the three   and   nine     months ended   September   30  , 2015  ,   net income of   $362,610   was recorded from discontinued operations as a result of the write-off of the remaining liabilities of   $320,056   and the reversal of accumulated other comprehensive income of   $42,553   from cumulative translation adjustments from RMDDx Corporation. 

11. Subsequent Events 

Subordinated promissory notes 

On October 11, 2016, the Company, with the consent of all seven investors, amended the terms of its $500,000 Subordinated Promissory Notes ( Notes ) and   w  arrants   to purchase common stock ( Warrants )  , which were originally issued as part of private offering on December 19, 2013.  The investor  s were provided   with the option to extend the maturity date of their Note  s   and the expiration date of their unexercised Warrants.   

Six of the seven investors agreed to extend the maturity dates of their respective Notes,   in the aggregate amount of   $450,000, from December 18, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Additionally, the   December 18, 2016   expiration date of   the   70,000 unexercised

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

W  arrants     was   also extended to December 31, 2018.  The terms of the   $50,000   Note of the investor electing not to extend remains unchanged   and remains payable on December 18, 2016  .  This investor has no unexercised   W  arrants.   

The extended Notes will bear interest on the unpaid principal at a simple annual interest rate equal to 10% per annum during the extension period, December 19, 2016 to December 31, 2018.  Interest only shall be payable in cash on a quarterly basis. Each investor entered into a Subordination Agreement with the initial offering which remains in effect throughout the extension period.  The Subordination Agreements provide that the indebtedness pursuant to the Notes shall be subordinated to all indebtedness of the Co  mpany pursuant to its   multi-year credit facility with a Massachusetts based bank.  

The initial offering provided that for every $50,000 in principal amount of Note, each investor received a Warrant to purchas  e 10,000 shares of common stock.    The Warrants   as amended   are exercisable during the period commencing six months after issuance and for   five   years from issuance, at an exercise price equal to $3.51 per share, namely, the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the day prior to the closing date of the offering.  

The Company calculated the incremental fair value of extending the expiration date of the Notes and Warrants and determined that the amendment represented a debt modification in accordance the guidance outlined in ASC-470,    Debt .    Using the Black-Scholes model, and the 10% test, the Company determined that the incremental fair value of the warrants to be $15,818  , which   will be recorded as a discount against the Notes Payable and an increase in Additional Paid-in Capital. 

Bank debt 

In October 2016, the Company received a commitment letter from its Massachusetts based bank which outlines proposed terms to refinance the Company s term debt subject to the terms and conditions and assumptions outlined therein.   The proposed terms include consolidating the Company s outstanding commercial term loan,   three    e  quipment term loans and $500,000   from the revolver to create a single   term note of approximately $2.6 million.    In addition   the proposal   includes a new $1.0 million equipment lin  e of credit and   a $500,000 revolver over-advance feature which is contingent upon approval of a working capital guarantee program through the Massachusetts economic development and finance agency.  The over-advance feature will provide guarantees to the bank on advances on accounts receivable aged between 90 and 180 days.  Some   of the Company s   off-shore   product deliveries   take weeks to arrive at foreign ports and   the related   credit terms are extended accordingly. The over-advance feature is beneficial to the Company because it adds   these type of accounts to the C  ompany s borrowing base.

The   decrease   in net sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was due primarily to a decrease in net sales of orthopedic implants and instruments.  Sales   o  f   sensors also decreased  . 

Net sales of orthopedic implants and instruments for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 decreased   27.9  % due to lower than expected volume from a large customer as compared to the same period in 2015.  The Company was notified by this customer at the end of second quarter that the demand for their product had decreased and to expect lower demand for the remainder of 2016.  Partially offsetting the decrease i  n demand from this customer were   new orders from   multiple   new orthopedic implant customers. 

Additionally, net sales of sensors decreased   13.0  % for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 when compared to the same period last year.    Sensor volume de  creased   16  %    when compared to the same quarter last year   due to customer mix, product mix and competitive pricing.  Silver surcharge billed increased   6.3  % due to an increase   of 28.3%   in the weighted average price of silver for the three months ended   September   30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.   

Net sales of thermoplastic injection molding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 3.1% due to   increased sales of automotive   components   and medical components.

The decrease in net sales for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 was due primarily to a decrease in net sales of orthopedic implants and instruments.  Sales   of sensors   also dec  reased  . 

Net sales of orthopedic implants and instruments for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 decreased   25.1  % due to lower than expected volume from a large customer as compared to the same period in 2015.  The Company was notified by this customer   at the end of the second quarter   that the demand for their product had decreased and to expect lower demand for the remainder of 2016.  Partially offsetting the decrease in demand from this customer were new orders from   multiple   new orthopedic implant customers beginning in the second quarter of 2016. 

Additionally, net sales of sensors decreased 11.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period   last year.  While sensor volume increased 1.0% over the same period last year, net sales decreased due to customer mix, product mix   and competitive pricing  .  Silver surcharge billed decreased 7.1  %    also   due to product mix, despite a   net   4.7  %    in  crease in the weighted average price of silver for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Net sales of thermoplastic injection molding for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   in  creased   slightly   due to   increased sales of automotive   components   and medical components.

The increase in gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a   26.3  % increase in gross profit from sensors  .  This was   due largely to increased gross profit from silver surcharge due to an increase in the weighted average price of silver when compared to the same prior year period.   In addition, despite volume decreases, gross profit as a percentage of sales for sensors increased   6.7   points due primarily to customer and product mix.     

Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from thermoplastic injection   molding increased   13.0  % due primarily to   efficiency improvements from automation  ,    operating leverage     and increased sales   of a  utomotive components   when compared to the same prior year period.  The increase in gross profit was partially offset by   the decline in sales of military and law enforcement components  . 

The   in  crease in gross profit for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 was   offset by a decrease of   31.1  %   in gross profit from orthopedic implants and instruments due to lower sales volume when compared to the same prior year period.

The notes are subordinated to all indebtedness of the Company pursuant to the bank credit facility.  

In October 2016, certain of these promissory notes and unexercised warrants were amended to extend their maturity dates to December 2018 (Note 11). 

No dividends were declared or paid in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

The Company continues to develop opportunities within new and existing channels where the Company can maximize its return on investments in capital equipment, research and development, marketing and human resources.  The Company is currently in negotiations with its bank on a new credit facility.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer ( the Certifying Officers ) have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)).  Based on such evaluation, our Certifying Officers have concluded the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, were effective. 

The effectiveness of a system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of internal controls, and fraud. Due to such inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud, or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   there have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

P    ART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Ris    k Factors 

In addition to the other information and Risk Factors in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the following should be considered when evaluating the Company and its business.  The risks and uncertainties described below and in our Form 10-K are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently know or that are currently not deemed significant to the Company's business may also impair the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company competes globally, with a large portion of its revenue derived from exports. Economic uncertainty or downturns in foreign markets could result in variability or have an adverse effect on the Company s financial results.  

While some risks exist in foreign markets, the Company s customers have historically been based in stable regions.  Approximately forty percent of the Company s revenue is derived from exports.  To reduce the risks associated with foreign shipment and currency exchange fluctuations, the title to most of the products are transferred to the customers when shipped, and payment is required in U.S. Dollars. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. Dollar could affect the demand of the Company s products, or the timing of orders. This uncertainty could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial results. 

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the  U.K. ) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the  E.U. ), commonly referred to as  Brexit . As a result of the referendum, it is expected that t  he British government will negotiate   the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal from   and future relationship with   the E.U. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect the Company. 

The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in which we conduct business with our foreign customers.  The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect the operating results of our foreign customers. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect the Company s financial condition.
