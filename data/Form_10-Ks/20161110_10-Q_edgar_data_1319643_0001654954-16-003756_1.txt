BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Organization and Nature of Operations 

Lode-Star
Mining Inc. (formerly International Gold Corp.) ( the
Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A., on
December 9, 2004. The Company s principal executive offices
are located in Cypress, Texas. The Company was originally formed
for the purpose of acquiring exploration stage natural resource
properties. The Company acquired a mineral property interest from
Lode Star Gold Inc., a private Nevada corporation
( LSG ) on December 11, 2014 (See Note 3) in
consideration for the issuance of 35,000,000 common shares of the
Company. As a result of this transaction, control of the Company
was acquired by LSG. 

On
May 12, 2015, International Gold Corp. completed a merger with its
wholly owned subsidiary, Lode-Star Mining Inc., and formally
assumed the subsidiary s name by filing Articles of Merger
with the Nevada Secretary of State (the  Name
Change ).  The subsidiary was incorporated entirely for
the purpose of effecting the Name Change and the merger did not
affect the Company s corporate structure in any other
way. 

Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the
Company will continue as a going concern. 

The future of the Company is dependent upon its
ability to establish a business and to obtain new financing to
execute a business plan. As shown in the accompanying financial
statements, the Company has incurred accumulated losses of
$1,620,904 for the period from December 9, 2004 (inception) to
September 30, 2016, and has had no revenue.  There is no
assurance that management s plans to seek additional capital
through private placements of its common stock will be realized,
and these factors cast substantial doubt upon the use of the going
concern assumption. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded assets, or the amounts of and     classification of liabilities that might be
necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in
existence.  

Basis of Presentation 

The
unaudited financial information furnished herein reflects all
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to
fairly state the Company s financial position and the results
of its operations for the periods presented.  These third
quarter financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company s financial statements and notes thereto included in
the Company s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015.  The Company assumes that the users of the
interim financial information herein have read, or have access to,
the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year, and
that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair
presentation may be determined in that
context.  Accordingly, footnote disclosure, which would
substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the
Company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, has been omitted.  The results of
operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending
December 31, 2016. 

Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation 

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation. These reclassifications on the interim
statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 had no effect on the reported results of operations. Expenses
paid by related parties on behalf of the Company were removed from
the net change in loan advances and from the change in accounts
payable and are shown as a Non-cash Financing Activity. The foreign
exchange gain component of the change in loan advances was removed
and shown as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash used
in operating activities. Accrued interest that was converted to
shares has been removed from the change in loan advances and
included in the change in accrued interest. The remaining change in
loan advances was separated into repayments of loans payable to
non-related parties and loan proceeds from related parties. These
changes in classification decreased the amount previously reported
as Cash Used In Operating Activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 from $174,020 to $132,798. Offsetting that
change, the amount previously reported for the 2015 period as Cash
Provided By Financing Activities decreased from $179,648 to
$138,426.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ( GAAP ). Because a precise determination
of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the
preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily
involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful
judgment. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise
noted. The financial statements have, in management s
opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of
materiality. 

The
Company has implemented all applicable new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. Those pronouncements did not
have any material impact on the financial statements unless
otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there
are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued
that might have a material impact on its financial position or
results of operations. 

3.  

MINERAL PROPERTY INTEREST 

Given
that permitting for operations on the Property is still to be
completed, at the request of the Company s management, LSG
granted a deferment to January 18, 2017 of payments otherwise due
in accordance with the Mineral Option Agreement between the
parties. At September 30, 2016, $198,901 was accrued for fees due
under the terms of the agreement. 

The
Company assessed its mineral property interest at September 30,
2016 and to the date of these financial statements and concluded
that facts and circumstances do not suggest that the mineral
property interest s carrying value exceeds its recoverable
amount and therefore no impairment is required. 

4.  

CAPITAL STOCK 

During
the nine months ended September, 2016, the Company had no cash
subscriptions for shares of its common stock. No preferred shares
have been issued to the date of issue of these financial
statements.

ITEM 2.  

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition to historical
financial information, the following discussion includes a number
of forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and
our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by
words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project
and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to
future events. You should not place undue certainty on these
forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this
report. Except as required by applicable law, including the
securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update
any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results 

Mineral Property Interest 

On August 29, 2014, we entered into a Letter of Intent (the
 LSG LOI ) with Lode-Star Gold, Inc. ( LSG"), a
private Nevada corporation, pursuant to which we agreed to issue
shares of our common stock and make certain payments to LSG in
consideration for the acquisition of an interest in LSG's Nevada
Goldfield Bonanza property (the  Property ). As a
result of the intended transaction, control of us would be acquired
by LSG. 

On October 4, 2014, we entered into a definitive mineral option
agreement (the "Option Agreement") which superseded the LSG LOI.
Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we were to issue LSG 35,000,000
shares of our common stock in exchange for a 20% undivided interest
in the Property (the  Acquisition ). In order to earn
an additional 60% undivided interest in the Property (for a total
of 80%), we are required to fund all expenditures on the Property
and pay LSG an aggregate of $5 million in cash in the form of a net
smelter returns ("NSR") royalty,   each beginning on the
closing date of a subscription agreement for the shares (the
 Closing Date ).   Until such time as ITGC has earned the additional
60% interest, the NSR royalty will be split as to 79.2% to LSG,
19.8% to and 1% to the former Property owner.  

The Property is located in west-central Nevada, in the Goldfield
Mining District at Latitude 37  42 , and Longitude
117  14 . The claims comprising the Property are located
in surveyed sections 35 and 36, Township 2 South, Range 42 East,
and in sections 1, 2, 11, and 12, Township 3 South, Range 42 East,
in Esmeralda County, Nevada. The Property is accessible by
traveling approximately one-half mile northeast of the community of
Goldfield, along a county-maintained road that originates at U.S.
Highway 95, which runs through  downtown  Goldfield.
The town of Goldfield, which is the Esmeralda county seat
(population 300), is approximately 200 air miles south of Reno and
180 air miles north of Las Vegas. 

The Property consists of 31 patented claims and 1 unpatented
millsite claim, covering a total of approximately 460 acres, or 186
hectares. Only the single unpatented claim is administered by the
United States Bureau of Land Management, and annual assessment
filings and payments are due on it. The patented claims are owned
as private land by LSG, and only annual property taxes must be
paid. 

Recent Developments 

We are in the final stages of completing materials for filing our
permit application. Additional activities for this quarter included
general cleanup and housekeeping of the surface facilities in
anticipation of submitting Notification of Commencement to both
State of Nevada and MSHA agencies in order to reoccupy our mine
workings. 

Given that permitting for operations on the Property is still to be
completed, at the request of our management, LSG granted, by a
letter of agreement, a deferment to January 18, 2017 of payments
totaling $198,901 due and accrued as of September 30, 2016 under
the terms of the Option Agreement. 

Personnel 

We have no employees. Our president and CEO, Mark Walmesley,
currently receives no compensation for his services. We expect to
continue to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and
accountants as necessary. 

Our Chief Operating Officer, Thomas Temkin, who is also a director,
is a Certified Professional Geologist and a Qualified Person under
National Instrument (NI) 43101, with more than 38 years of
experience in the mining industry, primarily in exploration in the
Western United States. He is currently a consulting geologist
working with LSG. Mr. Temkin has been associated with LSG and the
Property for over 15 years and has been instrumental through its
entire exploration program to date. 

Our Corporate Secretary, Pam Walters, has been associated with the
mining industry for over 25 years and has managed the corporate
finance and business operations of LSG and its owners.

ITEM 2. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Plan of Operations 

We anticipate that we will require approximately $2 million to
pursue our plan of operations over 12 months, as detailed in
previous quarterly filings. 

Our primary focus is currently on the mine permitting process. We
have retained the following specialists in underground permitting
of narrow vein, high sulphide mines to assist in executing that
permitting process: 

Rubicon
Environmental Consulting to act as the lead
consultant  

Hydrogeologica Inc. to consult on water and
geology  

Tierra
Group International to consult on mine planning and
engineering  

Unique to our permitting is the proposed underground area of work
named the Red Hills Stope Zone. It is 150 feet above the 450 foot
deep water table, making the mine essentially a dry
mine. 

The mine s 300 foot level workings has pockets of unused
volume where our potentially acid generating waste rock can be
stored. This means no waste rock will come to the surface and LSM
will avoid, for the short-term, the expense of having to build and
maintain a surface storage facility. 

We are hopeful that the two aforementioned mitigating circumstances
will make our permitting process more rapid and therefore, the
costs of execution and infrastructure improvements will be kept at
a minimum. 

Permitting costs are anticipated to be as follows: 

Funding 

We do not currently have sufficient funds to carry out our entire
plan of operations, so we intend to meet the balance of our cash
requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt
financing and equity financing through private placements.
Currently we are active in contacting broker/dealers regarding
possible financing arrangements; however, we do not currently have
any arrangements in place to complete any private placement
financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in
completing any such financings. 

If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our
capital raising efforts, we may review other financing options,
although we cannot provide any assurance that any such options will
be available to us or on terms reasonably acceptable to us.
Further, if we are unable to secure any additional financing then
we plan to reduce the amount that we spend on our operations,
including our management-related consulting fees and other general
expenses, so as not to exceed the capital resources available to
us. Regardless, our current cash reserves and working capital will
not be sufficient for us to sustain our business for the next 12
months, even if we decide to scale back our
operations. 

Going Concern 

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that
there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional
capital to pay our expenses. This is because we have not generated
any revenues to date and we cannot currently estimate the timing of
any possible future revenues. Our only source for cash at this time
is investments by others in our common stock, or
loans.

ITEM 2.  

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Results of Operations 

To September 30, 2016 

The following summary of our results of operations should be read
in conjunction with our financial statements for the period ended
September 30, 2016 which are included with this
Report. 

Revenues 

We have had no operating revenues since our inception on December
9, 2004. We recorded a net loss of $60,758 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 and have an accumulated deficit of $1,620,904.
The possibility and timing of revenue being generated from our
mineral property interest remains uncertain. 

Expenses   Three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

Notable period over period differences are as follows: 

Mineral
option fees were incurred in Q3 of 2016, but not in Q3 of 2015,
under the terms of our Mineral Option Agreement with LSG. They
first became due in Q4 of 2015. 

Office,
foreign exchange   sundry expenses were higher in Q3 of 2016
mainly due to increases in foreign exchange costs and travel
necessitated by site visits and business development
activity. 

Transfer
and filing fees were higher in Q3 of 2016 as the Company filed five
reports with the SEC in that quarter, compared to one in Q3 of
2015. 

Interest,
bank and finance charges were higher in Q3 of 2016 mainly due to
increased loan amounts. Interest-bearing loan balances totaled
approximately $520,215 at September 30, 2016 compared to $367,635
at September 30, 2015.

ITEM
2.   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 

Items with notable period-end differences are as
follows: 

Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities increased mainly due to the accrual
of approximately $20,000 for an IRS penalty in connection with the
Company s 2013 income tax filing, which was partly offset by
a decrease of approximately $10,000 in accounting and legal fees
due since the end of 2015. An identical IRS penalty for the
Company s 2012 tax year was waived and we are waiting for a
determination of our appeal of the 2013 penalty. 

The
change in Due to Related parties was a result of increased related
party loans and accrued interest in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 of approximately $130,000, together with the accrual of
fees due under the terms of the Company s mineral option
agreement with LSG of approximately $75,000. 

Loans payable     decreased
due to repayment of $15,000 in loan principal, partially offset by
the accrual of interest totaling approximately
$5,000.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2016, our total assets were $243,416, and our
total liabilities were $792,309. Our working capital as at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the changes between
those dates are summarized as follows: 

The increase in our working capital deficiency from December 31,
2015 to September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the increase in
amounts due to related parties of approximately $205,000, which is
explained above. The increase in accounts payable of approximately
$11,000 was largely offset by the decrease in loans payable of
approximately $10,000. 

Cash Flows 

Cash Used In Operating Activities 

The
decrease in cash used in operating activities of approximately
$85,000 was mainly due to the following: 

An increase in net loss for the 2016 period compared to the 2015
period of approximately $88,000, offset by: 

a
change of approximately $5,000 from a foreign exchange gain in 2015
to a loss in 2016; 

an
increase of approximately $2,000 in Prepaid fees in the 2015 period
, with no change in the 2016 period; 

a
difference of approximately $84,000 in the change in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities in 2016 versus 2015; 

accrued
mineral option fees of approximately $75,000 for the nine month
period in 2016, with none in the equivalent period in 2015;
and 

an
increase of approximately $7,000 in the change in accrued interest,
as interest-bearing loan balances increased. 

Cash Provided By Financing Activities 

The decrease of approximately $93,000 in cash provided by financing
activities was due to repayment of loans being $11,000 higher in
the 2016 period and direct loans from related parties increasing by
$60,000 in 2016, compared to approximately $142,000 in the 2015
period, a net decrease of approximately $82,000.

ITEM
2.   

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

As of the date of this quarterly report, we have yet to generate
any revenues from our business operations. Our ability to generate
adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs is entirely dependent on
the issuance of shares or loans. 

Our principal source of working capital has been in the form of
loans and subscriptions for our common stock. For the foreseeable
future, we will have to continue to rely on those sources for
funding. We have no assurance that we can successfully engage in
any further private sales of our securities or that we can obtain
any additional loans. 

ITEM 3.  

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the
information under this item. 

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and
with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our
Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the
Exchange Act. Based on this Evaluation, our Principal Executive
Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that our
Disclosure Controls were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
