NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September 30, 2016

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation   Going Concern Uncertainties

ProtoKinetix, Inc. (the "Company"), a development stage company, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 23, 1999.  The Company is a medical research company whose mission is the advancement of human health care.

The Company is currently researching the benefits and feasibility of synthesized Antifreeze Glycoproteins ("AFGP") or anti-aging glycoproteins, trademarked AAGP.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired certain patents and rights for cash consideration of $30,000 (25,000 Euros), as well as additional patent applications for cash consideration of $10,000 and 6,000,000 share purchase warrants with a fair value of $25,000 (Note 4).

A Cease Trade Order ("CTO") was issued in respect of the Company's securities by the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC") on May 9, 2013 based on the Company's failure to file annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 by the deadline of April 1, 2013. The Company has since completed all of the required filings for annual and interim periods and received a full Revocation Order from the BCSC during the year ended December 31, 2015.

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company filed Form 51-105F1   Notice   OTC Issuer Ceases to be an OTC Reporting Issuer with the BCSC.

The Company's financial statements are prepared consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going concern.

The Company has not developed a commercially viable product, has not generated any significant revenue to date, and has incurred losses since inception, resulting in a net accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company needs additional working capital to continue its medical research or to be successful in any future business activities and continue to pay its liabilities.  Therefore, continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the additional working capital necessary to accomplish its objective.  Management is presently engaged in seeking additional working capital through equity financing or related party loans.

The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company fail in any of the above objectives and is unable to operate for the coming year.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") applicable to interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed, or omitted, pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise noted below. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed March 30, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for a full fiscal year.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (cont'd)

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The more significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company's financial statements include estimates as to valuation of equity related instruments issued and deferred income taxes.

Cash 

Cash consists of funds held in checking accounts.  Cash balances may exceed federally insured limits from time to time.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Financial instruments, which includes cash and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities pursuant to ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The policy describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable

Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)

Level 1 inputs are used to measure cash. At September 30, 2016 there were no other assets or liabilities subject to additional disclosure.

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxed following the assets and liability method in accordance with the ASC 740 "Income Taxes."  Under such method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  The Company applies the accounting guidance issued to address the accounting for uncertain tax positions.  This guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as well as provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years that the asset is expected to be recovered or the liability settled.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (cont'd)

Intangible assets   patent and patent application costs 

The Company owns intangible assets consisting of certain patents and patent applications. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate. All other expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

As at September 30, 2016, the Company does not hold any intangible assets with indefinite lives.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization method and amortization period of an intangible asset with a finite life is reviewed at least annually.

Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the Company's patents, whereas no amortization has been recognized on the patent application costs as at September 30, 2016.

Research and Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Loss per Share and Potentially Dilutive Securities 

Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the period.  Diluted loss per share takes into consideration common shares outstanding (computed under basic earnings per share) and potentially dilutive securities.  The effect of 28,600,000 stock options (September 30, 2015   14,600,000) and 6,500,000 warrants (September 30, 2015   12,262,500) were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for all periods presented because it was anti-dilutive due to the Company's losses.

Share-Based Compensation 

The Company has granted warrants and options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock to various parties for consulting services.  The fair values of the warrants and options issued have been estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.

The Company accounts for stock compensation with persons classified as employees for accounting purposes in accordance with ASC 718 "Compensation   Stock Compensation", which recognizes awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest.  The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value of common shares issued for services is determined based on the Company's stock price on the date of issuance.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (cont'd)

Share-Based Compensation   (cont'd)

The Company accounts for stock compensation arrangements with persons classified as non-employees for accounting purposes in accordance with ASC 505-50 "Stock-Based Transactions with Nonemployees", which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of share-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying instruments vest. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period.

Common stock 

Common stock issued for non-monetary consideration are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date and classified as equity. The measurement date is defined as the earliest of the date at which the commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the common shares is reached or the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.

Transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of common stock, units and stock options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

Related Party Transactions 

A related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company's securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Company's management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company.  A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessment of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The requirement is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update 2016-09   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This accounting pronouncement, which goes into effect December 16, 2016, addresses the simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is reviewing this update to determine the impact it will have on its financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements     (cont'd)  

Accounting Standards Update 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842). This accounting pronouncement allows lessees to make an accounting policy election to not recognize a lease asset and liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not have a purchase option that is expected to be exercised. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update 2016-01   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This accounting pronouncement, which goes into effect December 12, 2017, is far reaching and covers several presentation areas dealing with measurement, impairment, assumptions used in estimating fair value and several other areas. The Company is reviewing this update to determine the impact it may have on its financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update 2015-17   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This accounting pronouncement requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. Currently deferred tax liabilities and assets must be presented as current and noncurrent. The policy is effective December 16, 2016. The Company is evaluating this guidance and believes it will have little impact on the presentation of its financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update 2015-02 - Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. This update provides guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this standard which has little impact on the presentation of its financial statements.

Accounting Standards Update 2015-01 - Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20). This Update is part of an initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). This Update eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has adopted this standard.

As such, the Plan is subject to an absolute cap of 20,000,000 shares.  The Plan includes two types of options; options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended are referred to as incentive options, and options which are not intended to qualify as incentive options are referred to as non-qualified options.

As of September 30, 2016, 16,600,000 options and 2,000,000 shares of common stock have been granted under the Plan.

The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors, or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors.  In addition to determining who will be granted options or stock bonuses, the committee has the authority and discretion to determine when options and bonuses will be granted and the number of options and bonuses to be granted.  The committee also may determine a vesting and/or forfeiture schedule for bonuses and/or options granted, the time or times when each option becomes exercisable, the duration of the exercise period for options and the form or forms of the agreements, certificates or other instruments evidencing grants made under the Plan.  The committee may determine the purchase price of the shares of common stock covered by each option and determine the fair market value per share.  The committee also may impose additional conditions or restrictions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.  The committee may adopt, amend and rescind such rules and regulations as in its opinion may be advisable for the administration of the Plan.

In the event that a change, such as a stock split, is made in the Company's capitalization which results in an exchange or other adjustment of each share of common stock for or into a greater or lesser number of shares, appropriate adjustments will be made to unvested bonuses and in the exercise price and in the number of shares subject to each outstanding option.  The committee also may make provisions for adjusting the number of bonuses or underlying outstanding options in the event the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings, or other increases or reductions of shares of its outstanding common stock.  Options and bonuses may provide that in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a corporate separation or division or the merger or consolidation of the Company, the holder may exercise the option on such terms as it may have been exercised immediately prior to such dissolution, corporate separation or division or merger or consolidation; or in the alternative, the committee may provide that each option granted under the Plan shall terminate as of a date fixed by the committee.

The exercise price of any option granted under the Plan must be no less than 100% of the "fair market value" of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Any incentive stock option granted under the Plan to a person owning more than 10% of the total combined voting power of the common stock must be at a price of no less than 110% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant.

The exercise price of an option may be paid in cash, in shares of the Company's common stock or other property having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option, or in a combination of cash, shares, other securities and property.  The committee determines whether or not property other than cash or common stock may be used to purchase the shares underlying an option and shall determine the value of the property received.

The financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable, they do involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties and are not (and should not considered to be) guarantees of future performance. Our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, among others:

Our capital requirements and the uncertainty of being able to obtain additional funding on terms acceptable to us;

Our plans to develop and commercialize products from the AAGP  molecule;

Ongoing testing of the AAGP  molecule;

Our intellectual property position;

Our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy;

Our ability to retain key members of our senior management and key scientific consultants;

The effects of competition;

Our potential tax liabilities resulting from conducting business in the United States and Canada;

The effect of further sales or issuances of our common stock and the price and volume volatility of our common stock; and

Our common stock's limited trading history.

Finally, our future results will depend upon various other risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those detailed in our filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  All forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

Business Overview

ProtoKinetix, Incorporated is a research and development stage bio-technology company focused on scientific medical research of AFGPs (Anti-Freeze Glycoproteins) or anti-aging glycoproteins, trademarked as AAGPs .  The Company has recently been in the process of directing major efforts to the practical side of commercial validation.  The commercial applications for AAGPs  in large markets such as targeted health care solutions are numerous, and ProtoKinetix is currently working with researchers, business leaders and advisors and commercial entities to bring AAGP  to market.

Results of Operations

The following table shows selected financial data and operating results for the periods noted.  Following the table, please see management's discussion of significant changes.

Revenues

We had no revenues for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Gross Profit and Expenses

The Company's net loss was $1,149,885 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $779,711 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  These expenses were primarily incurred for professional fees, share-based compensation recognized on stock options granted, research and development and other general and administrative expenses.  Significant changes from the prior nine month period ended September 30, 2015 include:

Consulting fees decreased by $65,000 from $65,000 to $nil primarily as a result of a change in terms of consulting contracts entered into for the current year.

General and administrative expenses decreased by $35,027 from $105,468 to $70,441 primarily as a result of a decrease in travel expenses associated with the office relocation, the lifting of the Cease Trade Order in British Columbia (the "CTO") and the changing of the management of the Company.

Interest expense decreased by $3,969 from $3,969 to $nil as a result of a decrease in short-term loans and notes payable.

22 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following summarizes our liquidity at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

At September 30, 2016, we had $88,965 in cash and $180,394 in total current assets.  As of September 30, 2016 we had a working capital position of $140,008.  Based upon our working capital equity as of September 30, 2016, we require additional equity and/or debt financing in order to meet cash flow projections and carry forward our business objectives.  There can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to raise capital from outside sources in sufficient amounts to fund our new business.

The failure to secure adequate outside funding would have an adverse effect on our plan of operation and results therefrom and a corresponding negative impact on stockholder liquidity.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities increased by $268,477 from $386,041 to $654,518 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  This increase was predominantly due to an increase in cash-based expenditures relating to the Company's current research contract with the University of British Columbia and study contracts with ITR Laboratories Canada as well as the Company's efforts to reduce historical accounts payable and accrued liabilities concurrent with the change in management completed in 2015.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $7,589 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 while the Company had net cash used in investing activities of $40,000 for the comparative period.  The difference is attributable to a decrease in the purchase of intangible assets.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $209,250 from $589,250 to $380,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively due to a decrease in private placements and short-term loan repayments.

Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The history of losses and the inability for the Company to make a profit from selling a good or service has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In spite of the fact that the current cash obligations of the Company are relatively minimal, given the cash position of the Company, we have very little cash to operate. We intend to fund the Company and attempt to meet corporate obligations by selling common stock.  However the Company's common stock is at a low price and is not actively traded.

23 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

None.

Contractual Obligations

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and (ii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements.

Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operation and/or financial condition. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q.

While all of the significant accounting policies are important to the Company's financial statements, the following accounting policies and the estimates derived there from have been identified as being critical.

Share-Based Compensation

On July 1, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Option and Stock Bonus Plan (the "Plan").  The Company has granted warrants and options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock to various parties for consulting services outside of the Plan, and beginning July 1, 2015 pursuant to the Plan.  The fair values of the warrants and options issued have been estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.

The Company accounts for stock compensation with persons classified as employees for accounting purposes in accordance with ASC 718 "Compensation   Stock Compensation", which recognizes awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest.  The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value of common shares issued for services is determined based on the Company's stock price on the date of issuance.

The Company accounts for stock compensation arrangements with persons classified as non-employees for accounting purposes in accordance with ASC 505-50 "Stock-Based Transactions with Nonemployees", which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of share-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying instruments vest. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period.

Sales and Marketing

The Company is currently not selling or marketing any products.

24 

Inflation

Although management expects that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Contractual Obligations

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information requested by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer), and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal accounting officer) has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by 1934 Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period covered by this report).  Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.

The Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its internal controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated by the SEC under the 1934 Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

25 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

Between September 2, 2016 and November 4, 2016, the Company issued 4,750,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $0.04 per share to accredited investors in a private placement transaction for gross proceeds of $190,000, of which, Clarence E. Smith, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, personally participated in the offering for the purchase of 4,250,000 shares.  The Company relied on the exemptions under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder for the issuance of common stock.  There was no general solicitation in connection with this offer and sale and no commission or other remuneration was paid on the issuance of the common stock.  A Form D was filed on September 16, 2016.

On October 6, 2016, the Company issued options to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.08 per share pursuant to the Plan to a consultant for services.  The consultant had current information regarding the Company and no general solicitation was used in this offering.  For this sale of securities, the Company relied on the exemption from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act with respect to transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.  No commissions were paid in connection with this issuance of securities.

Other than previously reported, there have been no unregistered sales of equity securities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.
