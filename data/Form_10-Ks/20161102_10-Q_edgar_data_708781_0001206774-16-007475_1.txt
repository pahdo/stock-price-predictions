  Note 1 - Basis of
Presentation    
    
  The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and
with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial
statements and related footnotes included in Cass Information System, Inc. s
(the  Company  or  Cass ) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015  .   
  Note 2   Intangible Assets
  
  The Company accounts for
intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350,  Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,  ( FASB ASC 350 ), which requires that intangibles with
indefinite useful lives be tested annually for impairment and those with finite
useful lives be amortized over their useful lives.  
  Details of the Company s
intangible assets are as follows:   
  
  The customer lists are
amortized over seven and ten years; the patents over 18 years; the non-compete
agreements over five years; software over three years; and other intangible
assets over fifteen years. Amortization of intangible assets amounted to
$305,000 and $306,000 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Estimated annual amortization of intangibles is as follows:
$408,000 in 2016, and $356,000 in each of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.   
  Note 3   Earnings Per Share
  
  Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the
weighted-average number of potential common shares outstanding. There were no
anti-dilutive shares in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The
calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:   

-7-   

Note 4   Stock Repurchases
  
  The Company maintains a
treasury stock buyback program pursuant to which the Board of Directors has
authorized the repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
As restored by the Board of Directors on October 19, 2015, the program provides
that the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common
stock and has no expiration date. The Company repurchased 0 and 68,105 shares
during the three-month periods and 187,123 and 192,690 during the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30,
2016, 301,156 shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
Repurchases may be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions
from time to time depending on market conditions. On October 17, 2016, the
Company s Board of Directors restored the repurchase program to 500,000 shares.
  
  Note 5   Industry Segment
Information  
  The services provided by
the Company are classified into two reportable segments: Information Services
and Banking Services. Each of these segments provides distinct services that are
marketed through different channels. They are managed separately due to their
unique service, processing and capital requirements.  
  The Information Services
segment provides transportation, energy, telecommunication, and environmental
invoice processing and payment services to large corporations. The Banking
Services segment provides banking services primarily to privately held
businesses and churches.   
  The Company s accounting
policies for segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. Management evaluates segment performance based
on net income after allocations for corporate expenses and income taxes.
Transactions between segments are accounted for at what management believes to
be fair value.  
  Substantially all revenue
originates from, and all long-lived assets are located within, the United
States, and no revenue from any customer of any segment exceeds 10% of the
Company s consolidated revenue.  
  Assets represent actual
assets owned by Information Services and Banking Services and there is no
allocation methodology used. Segment interest from customers is the actual
interest earned on the loans owned by Information Services and Banking Services,
respectively.   
  Summarized information
about the Company s operations in each industry segment is as follows:

-8-   

Note 6   Loans by Type
  
  A summary of loan
categories is as follows:       
  
  The following table
presents the aging of loans by loan categories at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:   
 
  -9-   

The following table
presents the credit exposure of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:   
 
   1 Loans subject
to normal monitoring involve borrowers of acceptable-to-strong credit quality
and risk, who have the apparent ability to satisfy their loan obligations.
    2 Loans subject to
special monitoring possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness which
requires a high level of management attention.  
  Impaired loans consist
primarily of nonaccrual loans, loans greater than 90 days past due and still
accruing interest and troubled debt restructurings, both performing and
nonperforming. Troubled debt restructuring involves the granting of a concession
to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty resulting in the modification of
terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate.
Management measures impairment in accordance with FASB ASC 310,  Allowance for
Credit Losses.  At September 30, 2016, impaired loans were evaluated using the
expected cash flow method. At December 31, 2015, all impaired loans were
evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral and the expected cash flow
method. The fair value of the collateral is based upon an observable market
price or current appraised value and therefore, the Company classifies these
assets as nonrecurring Level 3. One loan was delinquent 90 days and still
accruing interest at September 30, 2016, which was brought current on October 4,
2016 and has a sale contract that will pay the loan in full upon closing.
Therefore, it is not considered impaired. There were no loans delinquent 90 days
or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2015. There were no loans
classified as troubled debt restructuring at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015.  
  There were no foreclosed
loans recorded as other real estate owned (included in other assets) as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  -10-   

The following table
presents the recorded investment and unpaid principal balance for impaired loans
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   
  
  A summary of the activity
in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 is
as follows:   
  
  A summary of the activity

  Note 7   Commitments and
Contingencies   
  In the normal course of
business, the Company is party to activities that contain credit, market and
operational risks that are not reflected in whole or in part in the Company s
consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional
off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments and commitments under
operating leases. These financial instruments include commitments to extend
credit, commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit. The
Company s maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party  to the
financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of
credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts
of those instruments. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no amounts
have been accrued for any estimated losses for these
instruments.   
  -11-   

Commitments to extend
credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of
any condition established in the contract. Commercial and standby letters of
credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company or its subsidiaries to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These off-balance
sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The balance of unused loan
commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit were $15,976,000,
$14,238,000, and $1,820,000 at September 30, 2016 and were $11,755,000,
$11,581,000, and $1,857,000 at December 31, 2015, respectively. Since some of
the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments to extend
credit and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as
those financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets. The
Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The
amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit,
is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held
varies, but is generally accounts receivable, inventory, residential or
income-producing commercial property or equipment. In the event of
nonperformance, the Company or its subsidiaries may obtain and liquidate the
collateral to recover amounts paid under guarantees on these financial
instruments.   
  The following table
summarizes contractual cash obligations of the Company related to operating
lease commitments and time deposits at September 30, 2016:   
  
  The Company and its
subsidiaries are involved in various pending legal actions and proceedings in
which claims for damages are asserted. Management, after discussion with legal
counsel, believes the ultimate resolution of these legal actions and proceedings
will not have a material effect upon the Company s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.   
  Note 8   Stock-Based
Compensation   
  The Amended and Restated
Omnibus Stock and Performance Compensation Plan (the  Omnibus Plan ) permits the
issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock in the form of
stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock, restricted
stock units and performance awards. The Company issues shares out of treasury
stock for these awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 35,330
restricted shares and 0 SARs were granted under the Omnibus Plan.   
   Restricted
Stock   
 Restricted shares granted
prior to April 16, 2013 are amortized to expense over a three-year vesting
period. Beginning on April 16, 2013, restricted shares granted to Company
employees are amortized to expense over a three-year vesting period whereas
restricted shares granted to members of the Board of Directors are amortized to
expense over a one-year service period, with the exception of those shares
granted in lieu of cash payments for retainer fees which are expensed in the
period earned. As of September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation
expense related to non-vested restricted shares was $2,120,000, and the related
weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized is
approximately .8 years.   
  Following is a summary of
the activity of the restricted stock:   
  
  -12-   

SARs        
  SARs vest over a three-year
period, with one-third of the shares vesting and becoming exercisable each year
on the anniversary date of the grant, and they expire 10 years from the original
grant date. As of September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation
expense was $74,000, and the related weighted-average period over which it is
expected to be recognized is 0.3 years. Following is a summary of the activity
of the Company s SARs program for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2016:   
  
  Following is a summary of
the activity of the non-vested SARs during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016:   
  
  Note 9   Defined Pension
Plans   
  The Company has a
noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan, which covers most of its
employees. The Company accrues and makes contributions designed to fund normal
service costs on a current basis using the projected unit credit with service
proration method to amortize prior service costs arising from improvements in
pension benefits and qualifying service prior to the establishment of the plan
over a period of approximately 30 years. Disclosure information is based on a
measurement date of December 31 of the corresponding year. The following table
represents the components of the net periodic pension costs for 2015 and an
estimate for 2016:   
  
  Pension costs recorded to
expense were $965,000 and $1,010,000 for the three-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled $2,724,000 and $2,978,000 for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pension
costs decreased in 2016 due to an increase in the discount rate assumption and
the use of the updated mortality tables. The Company made no contribution to the
plan during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and is evaluating the
amount of additional contributions, if any, in the remainder of 2016.
  
  In addition to the above
funded benefit plan, the Company has an unfunded supplemental executive
retirement plan which covers key executives of the Company. This is a
noncontributory plan in which the Company and its subsidiaries make accruals
designed to fund normal service costs on a current basis using the same method
and criteria as its defined benefit plan. The following table represents the
components of the net periodic pension costs for 2015 and an estimate for 2016:

-13-   

Pension costs recorded to
expense were $201,000 and $286,000 for the three-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $604,000 and $857,000 for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  Note 10   Income Taxes
  
  As of September 30, 2016,
the Company s unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $1,503,000, of which
$1,124,000 would, if recognized, affect the Company s effective tax rate. As of
December 31, 2015, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits were approximately
$1,194,000, of which $861,000 would, if recognized, affect the Company s
effective tax rate. During the next 12 months, the Company may realize a
reduction of its unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $374,000 due to the
lapse of federal and state statutes of limitations.   
  The Company recognizes
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
The Company had $86,000 and $54,000 of gross interest accrued as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There were no penalties for
unrecognized tax benefits accrued at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
  
  The Company is subject to
income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and numerous state jurisdictions.
U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2015 remain subject
to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, the Company is
subject to state tax examinations for the tax years 2012 through 2015.
  
  Note 11   Investment in
Securities  
  Investment securities
available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The
Company s investment securities available-for-sale are measured at fair value
using Level 2 valuations. The market evaluation utilizes several sources which
include  observable inputs  rather than  significant unobservable inputs  and
therefore fall into the Level 2 category. The amortized cost, gross unrealized
gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value of investment securities are
summarized as follows:   
  
  The fair values of
securities with unrealized losses are as follows:   

-14-   

There were 16 securities,
or 5% of the total (none greater than 12 months), in an unrealized loss position
as of September 30, 2016. There were 5 securities, or 1% of the total (1 greater
than 12 months), in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2015. All
unrealized losses were reviewed to determine whether the losses were other than
temporary. Management believes that all unrealized losses are temporary since
they were market driven, and it is more likely than not that the Company will
not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized basis.   
  The amortized cost and fair
value of investment securities by contractual maturity are shown in the
following table. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities
because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without
prepayment penalties.   
  
  Proceeds from sales of
investment securities classified as available for sale were $0 and $33,395,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were
$21,491,000 and $99,347,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Gross realized gains were $0 and $1,271,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were $387,000 and
$2,910,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
There was one security totaling $3,750,000 pledged to secure public deposits and
for other purposes at September 30, 2016.   
  Note 12   Fair Value of
Financial Instruments   
  Following is a summary of
the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments:

The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:  
   Cash and Cash
Equivalents      The carrying amount
approximates fair value.   
  -15-   

Investment in Securities
     The fair value is measured on a
recurring basis using Level 2 valuations. Refer to Note 11,  Investment in
Securities,  for fair value and unrealized gains and losses by investment type.
  
   Loans      The fair value is estimated using present values
of future cash flows discounted at risk-adjusted interest rates for each loan
category designated by management and is therefore a Level 3 valuation.
Management believes that the risk factor embedded in the interest rates along
with the allowance for loan losses result in a fair valuation.   
  Impaired loans are valued
using the fair value of the collateral which is based upon an observable market
price or a current appraised value and therefore, the fair value is a
nonrecurring Level 3 valuation.   
   Accrued Interest
Receivable      The carrying amount
approximates fair value.   
   Deposits
     The fair value of demand
deposits, savings deposits and certain money market deposits is the amount
payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity
certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities and therefore, is a Level 2 valuation.
The fair value estimates above do not include the benefit that results from the
low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of
borrowing funds in the market or the benefit derived from the customer
relationship inherent in existing deposits.   
   Accounts and Drafts
Payable      The carrying amount
approximates fair value.   
   Accrued Interest  
   The carrying amount approximates
fair value.       
  There were no transfers
between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. No financial instruments are measured using Level 3
inputs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
  Note 13   Subsequent Events
  
  In accordance with FASB ASC
855,  Subsequent Events,  the Company has evaluated subsequent events after the
consolidated balance sheet date of September 30, 2016, and there were no events
identified that would require additional disclosures to prevent the Company s
unaudited consolidated financial statements from being misleading.   

ITEM 2.     
       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
      AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      
   Overview    
  Cass provides payment and
information processing services to large manufacturing, distribution and retail
enterprises from its offices/locations in St. Louis, Missouri, Columbus, Ohio,
Boston, Massachusetts, Greenville, South Carolina, Wellington, Kansas,
Jacksonville, Florida, and Breda, Netherlands. The Company s services include
freight invoice rating, payment processing, auditing, and the generation of
accounting and transportation information. Cass also processes and pays energy
invoices, which include electricity and gas as well as environmental and
telecommunications expense and is a provider of telecom expense management
solutions. Cass extracts, stores, and presents information from transportation,
energy, telecommunication and environmental invoices, assisting its customers 
transportation, energy, environmental and information technology managers in
making decisions that will enable them to improve operating performance. The
Company receives data from multiple sources, electronic and otherwise, and
processes the data to accomplish the specific operating requirements of its
customers. It then provides the data in a central repository for access and
archiving. The data is finally transformed into information through the
Company s databases that allow client interaction as required and provide
Internet-based tools for analytical processing. The Company also, through Cass
Commercial Bank, its St. Louis, Missouri-based bank subsidiary provides banking
services in the St. Louis metropolitan, Orange County, California, Colorado
Springs, Colorado, and other selected cities in the United States. In addition
to supporting the Company s payment operations, the Bank provides banking
services to its target markets, which include privately-owned businesses and
churches and church-related ministries.   

  -16-   

The specific payment and
information processing services provided to each customer are developed
individually to meet each customer s requirements, which can vary greatly. In
addition, the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange, imaging,
work flow, and web-based solutions varies greatly among customers and
industries. These factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the
customer base. In general, however, Cass is compensated for its processing
services through service fees and investment of account balances generated
during the payment process. The amount, type, and calculation of service fees
vary greatly by service offering, but generally follow the volume of
transactions processed. Interest income from the balances generated during the
payment processing cycle is affected by the amount of time Cass holds the funds
prior to payment and the dollar volume processed. Both the number of
transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics
followed by management. Other factors will also influence revenue and
profitability, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, which
have a significant effect on net interest income. The funds generated by these
processing activities are invested in overnight investments, investment grade
securities, and loans generated by the Bank. The Bank earns most of its revenue
from net interest income, or the difference between the interest earned on its
loans and investments and the interest paid on its deposits and other
borrowings. The Bank also assesses fees on other services such as cash
management services.   
  Industry-wide factors that
impact the Company include the willingness of large corporations to outsource
key business functions such as freight, energy, telecommunication and
environmental payment and audit. The benefits that can be achieved by
outsourcing transaction processing, and the management information generated by
Cass  systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive pressures
within industries to improve profitability, the general level of transportation
costs, deregulation of energy costs, and consolidation of telecommunication
providers. Economic factors that impact the Company include the general level of
economic activity that can affect the volume and size of invoices processed, the
ability to hire and retain qualified staff, and the growth and quality of the
loan portfolio. The general level of interest rates also has a significant
effect on the revenue of the Company. As discussed in greater detail in Item 7A,
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,  in the Company s
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, a decline in the general level of interest
rates can have a negative impact on net interest income and conversely, a rise
in the general level of interest rates can have a positive impact on net
interest income.   
  Currently, management views
Cass  major opportunity as the continued expansion of its payment and
information processing service offerings and customer base. Management intends
to accomplish this by maintaining the Company s leadership position in applied
technology, which when combined with the security and processing controls of the
Bank, makes Cass unique in the industry.   
   Critical Accounting
Policies    
  The Company has prepared
the consolidated financial statements in this report in accordance with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. These estimates have been generally accurate in the past,
have been consistent and have not required any material changes. There can be no
assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Certain
accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed
critical to the Company s results of operations or financial position have been
discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and are described
below.   
   Allowance for Loan
Losses   . The Company performs
periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall
collectability. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s
estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although these estimates
are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements,
actual results can differ significantly from estimated results. These policies
affect both segments of the Company. The impact and associated risks related to
these policies on the Company s business operations are discussed in the
 Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses  section of this report. The Company s
estimates have been materially accurate in the past, and accordingly, the
Company expects to continue to utilize the present processes.   
   Income
Taxes   . The objectives of
accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or
refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s
financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s
financial statements or tax returns such as the realization of deferred tax
assets or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the
Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by
the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. In accordance with
FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  the Company has unrecognized tax benefits related
to tax positions taken or expected to be taken. See Note 10 to the unaudited
consolidated financial statements contained herein.   
  -17-   

Pension Plans.
   The amounts recognized in the
unaudited consolidated financial statements related to pension plans are
determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
assumptions, including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which
the liabilities could be settled at December 31, 2015, rate of increase in
future compensation levels and mortality rates. These assumptions are updated
annually and are disclosed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
filed with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. Pursuant to FASB ASC 715,  Compensation   Retirement Benefits,  the
Company has recognized the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement
plan in its balance sheet and has recognized changes in that funded status
through comprehensive income. The funded status is measured as the difference
between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
as of the date of its fiscal year-end.  
   Results of Operations
   
  The following paragraphs
more fully discuss the results of operations and changes in financial condition
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 ( Third Quarter of 2016 )
compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 ( Third Quarter of
2015 ) and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 ( Nine Months Ended
2016 ) compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 ( Nine Months
Ended 2015 ). The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related
notes and with the statistical information and financial data appearing in this
report, as well as in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of
operations for the Third Quarter of 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be attained for any other period.   
   Net Income
   
  The following table
summarizes the Company s operating results  :   
  
   Fee Revenue and Other
Income   
  The Company s fee revenue
is derived mainly from transportation and facility payment and processing fees.
As the Company provides its processing and payment services, it is compensated
by service fees which are typically calculated on a per-item basis and by the
accounts and drafts payable balances generated in the payment process which can
be used to generate interest income. Processing volumes, fee revenue, and other
income were as follows  :   
  
  Third Quarter of 2016
compared to Third Quarter of 2015:   
  In the transportation market, new accounts boosted transaction volume, but multiple factors continued to challenge
dollar volume growth. A continuing impediment was declining activity from existing customers, especially those
involved in oil and gas production. Transportation sector dollar volume was also retarded by lower fuel prices
which reduced average invoice amounts. The expense management group had 16.0% growth in transaction volume.
New customer acquisition, including several large accounts that switched from competitors, was the primary driver
of the increase. Expense management dollar volume was also up for the quarter.  
  -18-   

There were no gains on
sales of securities in the Third Quarter of 2016, compared to $1,271,000 in the
Third Quarter of 2015.   
  Nine Months Ended 2016
compared to Nine Months Ended 2015:   
  Transportation transaction
and dollar volumes as well as expense management transaction volumes fluctuated
for the same reasons as the Second Quarter. Expense management dollar volume
decreased due to a change in the mix of its customer base.   
  There were $387,000 of
gains on sales of securities in the Nine Months Ended 2016, compared to
$2,910,000 in the Nine Months Ended 2015.   
   Net Interest Income
   
  Net interest income is the
difference between interest earned on loans, investments, and other earning
assets and interest expense on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.
Net interest income is a significant source of the Company s revenues. The
following table summarizes the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income and
related factors:   
  
  Third Quarter of 2016
compared to Third Quarter of 2015:   
  Third Quarter of 2016
average earning assets increased $117,169,000, or 9.5%, compared to the same
period in the prior year (see discussion in the following
paragraphs).  
  Average federal funds sold
and other short-term investments increased $62,777,000, or 51.1%, average
interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions increased $20,600,000,
or 19.3%, total average loans increased $15,919,000, or 2.4%, and average
investment securities increased $13,497,000, or 4.0%, for the Third Quarter of
2016 as compared to the Third Quarter of 2015. This was due to an increase in
deposits (see discussion in following paragraph) and accounts and drafts payable
balances.   
  Total average
interest-bearing liabilities for the Third Quarter of 2016 increased
$32,567,000, or 8.2%, average accounts and drafts payable increased $48,287,000,
or 7.5%, and average demand deposits increased $33,022,000, or 20.6%, for the
Third Quarter of 2016.   
  Net interest margin and
yield on earning assets decreased due to a less favorable mix of earning assets
in the Third Quarter of 2016. However, the 9.5% increase in the volume of
earning assets more than offset the decrease in yield and resulted in a 3.8%
increase in net interest income.   
  Nine Months Ended 2016
compared to Nine Months Ended 2015:   
  Nine Months Ended 2016
average earning assets increased $65,877,000, or 5.3%, compared to the same
period in the prior year (see following discussion).   
  Average federal funds sold
increased $33,341,000, or 31.7%, for the Nine Months Ended 2016 as compared to
the Nine Months Ended 2015. Average investment securities increased $24,371,000,
or 7.6%, as the Company took advantage of market opportunities.   
  -19-   

Total average
interest-bearing liabilities for the Nine Months Ended 2016 decreased
$9,833,000, or 2.4%, compared to the Nine Months Ended 2015. Average demand
deposits increased $27,921,000, or 17.5%, and average accounts and drafts
payable increased $19,648,000, or 3.1%.   
  Net interest margin and
yield on earning assets decreased slightly, however, the 5.3% increase in the
volume of earning assets more than offset the slight decrease in yield and
resulted in a 3.3% increase in net interest income.   
  For more information on the
changes in net interest income, please refer to the tables that
follow.  
   Distribution of Assets,
Liabilities and Shareholders  Equity; Interest Rate and Interest Differential
   
  The following tables show
the condensed average balance sheets for each of the periods reported, the
tax-equivalent interest income and expense on each category of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the average yield on such
categories of interest-earning assets and the average rates paid on such
categories of interest-bearing liabilities for each of the periods reported.

   Provision and Allowance
for Loan Losses ( ALLL )    
  A significant determinant
of the Company s operating results can be the provision for loan losses.
Provision for loan losses were $0 during the Third Quarter of 2016 and the Third
Quarter of 2015. Due to the improved assessment of the overall quality of the
Company s loan portfolio, primarily due to the payoff of a large nonperforming
loan, a negative loan loss provision of ($1,000,000) was recorded during the
Nine Months Ended 2016. There was no loan loss provision recorded in the Nine
Months Ended 2015. As discussed below, the Company continually analyzes the
outstanding loan portfolio based on the performance, financial condition and
 collateralization     of the
credits. Net loan recoveries were $1,000 and net loan charge-offs were $20,000
during the Third Quarter of 2016 and the Third Quarter of 2015, respectively.
Net loan recoveries were $38,000 in the Nine Months Ended 2016 and net loan
charge-offs were $12,000 during the Nine Months Ended 2015.   
  -23-   

The ALLL at September 30,
2016 was $10,673,000 and at December 31, 2015 was $11,635,000. The ratio of ALLL
to total loans outstanding at September 30, 2016 was 1.56% compared to 1.77% at
December 31, 2015. Nonperforming loans were $1,324,000, or .19%, of total loans
at September 30, 2016 compared to $3,135,000, or .48%, of total loans at
December 31, 2015. These loans, which are also considered impaired, consisted of
one nonaccrual loan and one past due 90 days and accruing at September 30, 2016.
Total nonaccrual loans decreased $2,795,000 from December 31, 2015 to September
30, 2016, primarily due to the payoff of two loans.   
  The ALLL has been
established and is maintained to absorb reasonably estimated and probable losses
in the loan portfolio. An ongoing assessment is performed to determine if the
balance is adequate. Charges or credits are made to expense to cover any
deficiency or reduce any excess, as required. The current methodology consists
of two components: 1) estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans
that are determined to be impaired in accordance with FASB ASC 310  Allowance
for Credit Losses,  and 2) estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of
the loan portfolio in accordance with FASB ASC 450,  Contingencies.  Estimated
credit losses is an estimate of the current amount of loans that is probable the
Company will be unable to collect according to the original terms.  
  For loans that are
individually evaluated, the Company uses two impairment measurement methods: 1)
the present value of expected future cash flows and 2) collateral value. For the
remainder of the portfolio, the Company groups loans with similar risk
characteristics into eight segments and applies historical loss rates to each
segment based on a five fiscal-year look-back period. In addition, qualitative
factors including credit concentration risk, national and local economic
conditions, nature and volume of loan portfolio, legal and regulatory factors,
downturns in specific industries including losses in collateral value, trends in
credit quality at the Company and in the banking industry and trends in
risk-rating agencies are also considered.  
  The Company also utilizes
ratio analysis to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the ALLL compared to
its peers and required levels of regulatory capital. Federal and state agencies
review the Company s methodology for maintaining the ALLL. These agencies may
require the Company to adjust the ALLL based on their judgments and
interpretations about information available to them at the time of their
examinations.  
   Summary of Asset Quality
   
  The following table
presents information on the Company s provision for loan losses and analysis of
the ALLL:   
  
  The Bank had no property
carried as other real estate owned as of September 30, 2016 or December 31,
2015.

Operating Expenses
   
  Total operating expenses
for the Third Quarter of 2016 were up 4.1%, or $917,000, compared to the Third
Quarter of 2015 and were up $1,944,000 for the Nine Months Ended 2016 compared
to the Nine Months Ended 2015.   
  Personnel
expense for the Third Quarter of 2016 increased $558,000 compared to the Third
Quarter of 2015 and increased $1,637,000 to $54,267,000 for the Nine Months
Ended 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended 2015 due to strategic investment in
staff and technology to win and support new business, annual merit increases,
and higher health insurance expense. This was offset by a decrease in retirement
plan expense related to the use of new mortality tables and an increase in the
discount rate.   
  Equipment expense for the
Third Quarter of 2016 increased $57,000, or 5.3%, compared to the Third Quarter
of 2015 and increased $81,000, or 2.5%, for the Nine Months Ended 2016 from the
Nine Months Ended 2015.   
  Other operating expenses
for the Third Quarter of 2016 increased $316,000 compared to the Third Quarter
of 2015 and increased $232,000 for the Nine Months Ended 2016 from the Nine
Months Ended 2015 primarily due to higher outside service and professional
service expense.  
  Income tax expense for the
Third Quarter of 2016 decreased $228,000 compared to the Third Quarter of 2015
and decreased $51,000 for the Nine Months Ended 2016 compared to the Nine Months
Ended 2015. The effective tax rate was 23.0% and 26.2% for the Third Quarters of
2016 and 2015, respectively, and was 24.8% and 26.0% for the Nine Months Ended
2016 and 2015, respectively. This was the result of credits for the continued
strategic investment in technology.   
   Financial Condition
   
  Total assets at September
30, 2016 were $1,547,653,000, an increase of $92,147,000, or 6.3%, from December
31, 2015. The most significant changes in asset balances during this period were
an increase of $49,931,000 in cash and cash equivalents and an increase of
$25,819,000 in loans. Changes in cash and cash equivalents reflect the Company s
daily liquidity position and are affected by the changes in the other asset
balances and changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable
balances.  
  Total liabilities at
September 30, 2016 were $1,335,341,000, an increase of $87,213,000, or 7.0%,
from December 31, 2015. Accounts and drafts payable at September 30, 2016 were
$682,762,000, an increase of $105,503,000, or 18.3%, from December 31, 2015.
Total deposits decreased $22,471,000, or 3.5%, from December 31, 2015. Total
shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 was $212,312,000, a $4,934,000, or
2.4%, increase from December 31, 2015.   
  Accounts and drafts payable
will fluctuate from period-end to period-end due to the payment processing
cycle, which results in lower balances on days when checks clear and higher
balances on days when checks are issued. For this reason, average balances are a
more meaningful measure of accounts and drafts payable (for average balances
refer to the tables under the  Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and
Shareholders  Equity; Interest Rate and Interest Differential  section of this
report).   
  The increase in total
shareholders  equity of $4,934,000 resulted primarily from net income of
$17,924,000 and a decrease of $2,941,000 in accumulated other comprehensive
loss. These were offset by an increase in common shares in treasury of
$8,252,000 and dividends paid of $7,406,000.   
   Liquidity and Capital
Resources    
  The balance of liquid
assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from
banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, federal funds
sold and other short-term investments, was $303,103,000 at September 30, 2016,
an increase of $49,931,000, or 19.7%, from December 31, 2015. At September 30,
2016, these assets represented 19.6% of total assets. These funds are the
Company s and its subsidiaries  primary source of liquidity to meet future
expected and unexpected loan demand, depositor withdrawals or reductions in
accounts and drafts payable.   
  Secondary sources of
liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines. Total investment
in securities was $382,671,000 at September 30, 2016, an increase of $6,975,000
from December 31, 2015. These assets represented 24.7% of total assets at
September 30, 2016. Of this total, 96% were state and political subdivision
  securities. Of the total
portfolio, 9.7% mature in one year or less, 15.3% mature in one to five years,
and 75.0% mature in five or more years   .

The Bank has unsecured
lines of credit at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum
of $78,000,000 at the following banks: Bank of America, $10,000,000; US Bank,
$20,000,000; Wells Fargo Bank, $15,000,000; Frost National Bank, $10,000,000;
PNC Bank, $12,000,000; UMB Bank, $5,000,000; and JPM Chase Bank, $6,000,000. The
Bank also has secured lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of
$204,136,000 collateralized by commercial mortgage loans. The Company also has
secured lines of credit with UMB Bank of $50,000,000 and First Tennessee Bank of
$50,000,000 collateralized by state and political subdivision securities. There
were no amounts outstanding under any line of credit as of September 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015.   
  The deposits of the
Company s banking subsidiary have historically been stable, consisting of a
sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize other
commercial products of the Bank. The accounts and drafts payable generated by
the Company has also historically been a stable source of funds. The Company is
part of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS ) and
Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS ) deposit placement programs. Time deposits include
$33,064,000 of CDARS deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits include
$76,837,000 of ICS deposits. These programs offer the Bank s customers the
ability to maximize Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance
coverage. The Company uses these programs to retain or attract deposits from
existing customers.  
  Net cash flows provided by
operating activities were $25,615,000 for the Nine Months Ended 2016 compared
with $25,805,000 for the Nine Months ended 2015, a decrease of $190,000. Net
cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the
Company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer
activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances.
Other causes for the changes in these account balances are discussed earlier in
this report. Due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances, the
analysis of changes in average balances, also discussed earlier in this report,
can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period-end balances used
in the statements of cash flows. Management anticipates that cash and cash
equivalents, maturing investments and cash from operations will continue to be
sufficient to fund the Company s operations and capital expenditures in 2016,
which are estimated to range from $5 million to $7 million.   
  The Company faces market
risk to the extent that its net interest income and fair market value of equity
are affected by changes in market interest rates. For information regarding the
market risk of the Company s financial instruments, see Item 3,  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.    
  There are several trends
and uncertainties that may impact the Company s ability to generate revenues and
income at the levels that it has in the past. In addition, these trends and
uncertainties may impact available liquidity. Those that could significantly
impact the Company include the general levels of interest rates, business
activity, and energy costs as well as new business opportunities available to
the Company.  
  As a financial institution,
a significant source of the Company s earnings is generated from net interest
income. Therefore, the prevailing interest rate environment is important to the
Company s performance. A major portion of the Company s funding sources are the
non-interest bearing accounts and drafts payable generated from its payment and
information processing services. Accordingly, higher levels of interest rates
will generally allow the Company to earn more net interest income. Conversely, a
lower interest rate environment will generally tend to depress net interest
income. The Company actively manages its balance sheet in an effort to maximize
net interest income as the interest rate environment changes. This balance sheet
management impacts the mix of earning assets maintained by the Company at any
point in time. For example, in the lower interest rate environment currently
faced by the Company, short-term, relatively lower rate liquid investments are
reduced in favor of longer-term relatively higher yielding investments and
loans.   
  The overall level of
economic activity can have a significant impact on the Company s ability to
generate revenues and income, as the volume and size of customer invoices
processed may increase or decrease. Higher levels of economic activity increase
both fee income (as more invoices are processed) and balances of accounts and
drafts payable.  
  The relative level of
energy costs can impact the Company s earnings and available liquidity. Lower
levels of energy costs will tend to decrease transportation and energy invoice
amounts resulting in a corresponding decrease in accounts and drafts payable.
Decreases in accounts and drafts payable generate lower interest income.
  
  New business opportunities
are an important component of the Company s strategy to grow earnings and
improve performance. Generating new customers allows the Company to leverage
existing systems and facilities and grow revenues faster than
expenses.

The Basel III Capital Rules
require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet and maintain several
minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets
ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total
capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets
leverage ratio. The FDIC also requires a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, defined
as the ratio of Tier 1 capital less purchased mortgage serving rights to total
assets, for banking organizations deemed the strongest and most highly rated by
banking regulators. A higher minimum leverage ratio is required of less
highly-rated banking organizations.   
  Common equity Tier 1
capital is generally defined as common stockholders  equity and retained
earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and
Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority
interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital
includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1
capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments
and related surplus meeting specified requirements. Also included in Tier 2
capital is the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of
risk-weighted assets and, for institutions like Cass, that have exercised an
opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity
securities with readily determinable fair market values. The calculation of all
types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified
in applicable regulations.   
  In addition to establishing
the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules limit
capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if
the institution does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5%
of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount
necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital
conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at
0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented
at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  
  The Company and the Bank
continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements, as evidenced by the
following capital amounts and ratios:   
  
   Inflation
   
  The Company s assets and
liabilities are primarily monetary, consisting of cash, cash equivalents,
securities, loans, payables and deposits. Monetary assets and liabilities are
those that can be converted into a fixed number of dollars. The Company s
consolidated balance sheet reflects a net positive monetary position (monetary
assets exceed monetary liabilities). During periods of inflation, the holding of
a net positive monetary position will result in an overall decline in the
purchasing power of a company. Management believes that replacement costs of
equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements will not materially affect
operations. The rate of inflation does affect certain expenses, such as those
for employee compensation, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of
the Company s services.   
   Impact of New and Not
Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    
  In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09      Revenue from
Contracts with Customers   . The ASU
supersedes revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,
including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance in the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification. The core principle of the new guidance is
that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The
guidance identifies specific  steps that
entities should apply in order to achieve this principle. Under the ASU, the
amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1,
2018 and must be applied retrospectively. The impact of the adoption of this ASU
is currently being evaluated but is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
   
  -27-   

In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-02      Leases
(ASC Topic 842)   . The ASU improves
financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies
and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and
manufacturing equipment. Consistent with current generally accepted accounting
principles  GAAP , the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses
and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its
classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current
GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance
sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the
balance sheet. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other
financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty
of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and
quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts
recorded in the financial statements. The ASU on leases will take effect for
public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The impact of the adoption of this ASU
is currently being evaluated but is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
  
  In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-09      Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting   . The ASU will simplify
the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard is
effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The impact of
the adoption of this ASU is currently being evaluated.   
  In June 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-13 -    Financial
Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments.    The ASU requires
measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held.
Under this standard, a company will be required to hold an allowance equal to
the expected life-of-loan losses on the loan portfolio. The standard is
effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The impact of
the adoption of this ASU is currently being evaluated.   
   ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
  As described in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the
Company manages its interest rate risk through measurement techniques that
include gap analysis and a simulation model. As part of the risk management
process, asset/liability management policies are established and monitored by
management. The policy objective is to limit the change in annualized net
interest income to 15.0% from an immediate and sustained parallel change in
interest rates of 200 basis points. Based on the Company s most recent
evaluation, management does not believe the Company s risk position at September
30, 2016 has changed materially from that at December 31, 2015.   
   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES    
  The Company s management,
under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15e and
15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of
the period covered by this report and concluded that, as of such date, these
controls and procedures were effective.  
  There were no changes in
the Third Quarter of 2016 in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting identified by the Company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer in connection with their evaluation that materially affected
or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  
   PART II. OTHER
INFORMATION    

ITEM 1.    
     
         LEGAL
      PROCEEDINGS    The Company
      is the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions and
      proceedings, including those that arise in the ordinary course of
      business. Management believes the outcome of all such proceedings will not
      have a material effect on the businesses or financial conditions of the
      Company or its subsidiaries.    

ITEM
      1A.

      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

(c)  
      Evaluated the

(d)  
      Disclosed in this
      report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial
      reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter

      that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
      affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
      and   

5.  
      The
      registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
      our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting,
      to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s
      board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
    functions):   

(a)    
      All significant
      deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
      internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
      adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize
      and report financial information; and   

(b)  
      Any fraud, whether or
      not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
      significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial
      reporting.
