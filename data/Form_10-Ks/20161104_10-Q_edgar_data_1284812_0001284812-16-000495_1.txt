1. Organization and Description of Business 
  Cohen   Steers, Inc. (CNS) was organized as a Delaware corporation on March 17, 2004. CNS is the holding company for its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Cohen   Steers Capital Management, Inc. (CSCM), Cohen   Steers Securities, LLC (CSS), Cohen   Steers Asia Limited (CSAL), Cohen   Steers UK Limited (CSUK) and Cohen   Steers Japan, LLC (collectively, the Company). 
  The Company is a global investment manager specializing in liquid real assets, including real estate securities, listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, as well as preferred securities and other income solutions. Founded in 1986, the Company is headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seattle. 

2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
   The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The condensed consolidated financial statements set forth herein include the accounts of CNS and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the interim results have been made. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted   In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised the guidance applicable to consolidation of legal entities. The revised rules include guidance for evaluating (a) limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) the impact of decision maker or service provider fees on the consolidation analysis, (c) the impact of interests held by related parties on the consolidation analysis and (d) consolidation of certain investment funds. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, using a full retrospective method. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, the Company reevaluated all of its sponsored funds and management fees under the new guidance. The Company concluded that certain entities that were not previously considered Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) would be considered VIEs under the revised guidance. See Note 4 for further discussion of the Company's seed investments. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the disclosure of certain investments that calculate net asset value per share (NAV) as a practical expedient. This guidance removes the requirement to categorize such investments within the fair value hierarchy table. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. As a result of adoption,   $7.1 million   and   $6.5 million   of NAV investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are no longer classified within Level 2 and Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in Note 5 are intended to permit reconciliation of the investments included in the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position. 
  Accounting Estimates   The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes the estimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the captions "distribution and service fees payable" and "due to broker" have been reclassified from "other liabilities and accrued expenses."

Consolidation of Company-sponsored Funds   The Company consolidates entities, including sponsored funds, that are deemed to be voting interest entities (VOE) when it has financial control over the entity which is generally when the Company owns a majority of the outstanding voting interest. Investments in Company-sponsored funds and management fees are evaluated at inception and subsequently if there is a reconsideration event to determine if the fund is a VIE or VOE and which consolidation model to apply. All of the Company's management fees are presumed to be commensurate and at market and are therefore not considered variable interests. VIEs for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary are consolidated. Investments in Company-sponsored funds that are determined to be VOEs are consolidated when the Company s ownership interest is greater than   50%   of the outstanding voting interests of the fund or when the Company is the general partner of the fund and the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights in the fund. The Company records noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries for which the Company s ownership is less than   100   percent. 
  A VIE is an entity in which either (a) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or (b) the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Investments and redemptions or amendments to the governing documents of the respective entities could affect an entity's status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. The Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of any VIEs identified by evaluating its economic interests in the entity held either directly by the Company and its affiliates or indirectly through employees. See Note 4 for further discussion about the Company s seed investments. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of   three months   or less. 
  Due from/to Broker   The Company conducts business, primarily with respect to its consolidated seed investments, with brokers for certain of its investment activities. The clearing and custody operations for these investment activities are performed pursuant to contractual agreements. The due from/to broker balance represents cash and cash equivalents balances at brokers/custodians and/or net receivables and payables for unsettled security transactions. 
  Investments   Management of the Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each statement of financial condition date. 
  Investments classified as trading represent securities held within the affiliated funds that the Company consolidates and are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices, market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management or as determined by the Company s valuation committee. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as gain (loss) from trading investments net in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Investments classified as equity method investments represent seed investments in which the Company owns between 20-50% of the outstanding voting interests in the fund or when it is determined that the Company is able to exercise significant influence but not control over the investments. When using the equity method, the Company recognizes its respective share of the investee s net income or loss for the period which is recorded as equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's equity method investments consisted of interests in affiliated funds which measure their underlying investments at fair value based on quoted market prices or NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and report a net asset value on a recurring basis. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair value. 
  Investments classified as available-for-sale are comprised of equity securities, investment-grade preferred instruments and investments in Company-sponsored open-end funds where the Company has neither control nor the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or market prices obtained from independent pricing services engaged by management, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company periodically reviews each individual security position that has an unrealized loss, or impairment, to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. If the Company believes an

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

impairment of a security position is other than temporary, based on available quantitative and qualitative information as of the report date, the loss will be recognized as gain (loss) from available-for-sale investments net in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  From time to time, the affiliated funds consolidated by the Company enter into derivative contracts to gain exposure to the underlying commodities markets or to hedge market and credit risks of the underlying portfolios utilizing options, total return swaps, credit default swaps and futures contracts. These instruments are measured at fair value with gains and losses recorded as gain (loss) from trading investments net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of these instruments are recorded in other assets or other liabilities and accrued expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the outstanding derivative contracts were subject to a master netting agreement or other similar arrangement. 
  Additionally, from time to time, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency exposure related to certain client receivables. These instruments are measured at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other non-operating income in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of these contracts are recorded in other assets or other liabilities and accrued expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets   Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the Company s investment in the net assets of an acquired company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value to their carrying amounts. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 3 for further discussion about the Company s goodwill and intangible assets. 
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest   Redeemable noncontrolling interest represents third-party interests in the Company's consolidated entities. This interest is redeemable at the option of the investors and therefore is not treated as permanent equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is remeasured at redemption value which approximates the fair value at each reporting period. 
  Investment Advisory and Administration Fees   The Company earns revenue by providing asset management services to institutional accounts and to Company-sponsored open-end and closed-end funds. Investment advisory fees are earned pursuant to the terms of investment management agreements, and are based on a contractual fee rate applied to the assets in the portfolio. The Company also earns administration fees from certain Company-sponsored open-end and closed-end funds pursuant to the terms of underlying administration contracts. Administration fees are based on the average assets under management of such funds. Investment advisory and administration fee revenue is recognized as such fees are earned. 
  Distribution and Service Fee Revenue   CSS acts as the principal distributor of the Company s sponsored open-end funds which may offer the following classes: Class A (initial sales load), Class C (back end sales load), Class R (load retirement) and Class Z (no load retirement). Effective May 2007, the Company suspended sales of Class B shares and all remaining Class B shares converted to Class A shares in 2015. Distribution and service fee revenue is based on the average daily net assets of the funds as detailed below. Distribution and service fee revenue is earned daily and is recorded gross of any third-party distribution and service fee expense for applicable share classes. 
  Pursuant to distribution plans with the Company's sponsored open-end funds, CSS receives distribution fees of up to 25bps for Class A shares and 75bps for Class C shares. CSS also receives shareholder servicing fees of up to 10bps on Class A shares and 25bps on Class C shares, pursuant to shareholder servicing plans with the funds. 
  CSS receives combined distribution and shareholder servicing fees of up to 50bps for Class R shares. 
  Distribution and Service Fee Expense   Distribution and service fee expense includes distribution fees, service fees and intermediary assistance payments. Distribution and service fee expense is recorded as incurred.

COHEN   STEERS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Distribution fee expense represents payments made to qualified dealers/institutions for (i) assistance in connection with the distribution of the Company's sponsored open-end funds' shares and (ii) for other expenses such as advertising costs and printing and distribution of prospectuses to investors. Such amounts may also be used to pay financial intermediaries for services as specified in the terms of written agreements complying with Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Rule 12b-1). CSS pays distribution fee expense based on the average daily net assets under management of up to 25bps on Class A shares and 75bps on Class C shares. 
  Shareholder servicing fee expense represents payments made to qualified dealers/institutions for shareholder account service and maintenance. These services are provided pursuant to written agreements with such qualified institutions. CSS pays service fee expenses based on the average daily net assets under management of up to 10bps on Class A shares and 25bps on Class C shares.  
  CSS pays combined distribution and service fee expenses based on the average daily net assets under management of up to 50bps on Class R shares. 
  Intermediary assistance payments represent payments to qualified dealers/institutions for activities related to distribution, shareholder servicing and marketing and support of Company-sponsored open-end funds and are incremental to those described above. Intermediary assistance payments are generally based on the average assets under management or the number of accounts being serviced. 
  Portfolio Consulting and Other   The Company earns portfolio consulting and other fees by: (i) providing portfolio consulting services in connection with model-based strategy accounts; (ii) earning a licensing fee for the use of the Company's proprietary indexes; and (iii) providing portfolio monitoring services related to a number of unit investment trusts. This revenue is earned pursuant to the terms of the underlying contract, and the fee schedules for these relationships vary based on the type of services the Company provides for each relationship. This revenue is recognized as such fees are earned. 
  Stock-based Compensation   The Company recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees. This expense is recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service. The Company also estimates forfeitures. 
  Income Taxes   The Company records the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years at tax rates that are expected to apply in those years. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable income in future years at tax rates that are expected to apply in those years. The Company records a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized. The effective tax rate for interim periods represents the Company s best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applied to the full fiscal year. 
  The calculation of the tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. 
  Currency Translation and Transactions   Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the applicable condensed consolidated statement of financial condition date. Revenue and expenses of such subsidiaries are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The gains or losses resulting from translating non-U.S. dollar functional currency into U.S. dollars are included in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The cumulative translation adjustment was   $(5,124,000)   and   $(3,908,000)   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Gains or losses resulting from non-U.S. dollar currency transactions are included in other non-operating income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Comprehensive income includes net income or loss attributable to common stockholders, foreign currency translation gain and loss (net of tax), unrealized gain and loss from available-for-sale investments (net of tax) and reclassification to statements of operations of gain and loss from available-for-sale investments (net of tax). 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance amending the current guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is intended to unify the currently diverse presentations and classifications,   which address eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows, including d  ebt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.   This new guidance will be effective for the Company s first quarter of 2018 and requires a retrospective approach to adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this revised guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance amending the current accounting for an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting. The guidance requires that the cost of acquiring an additional interest in the entity, if any, that resulted in the investment qualifying for the equity method be added to the carrying value of the investment. The equity method will then be applied from that point forward without any retroactive application or adjustment. This new guidance will be effective for the Company s first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, excess tax benefits, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This new guidance will be effective for the Company s first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance introducing a new lease model which requires all operating leases to be recorded on the balance sheet as right of use assets and offsetting lease liability obligations. The guidance requires disclosures by lessees and lessors to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This new guidance will be effective for the Company s first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this new guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance amending the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. This new guidance will be effective for the Company s first quarter of 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this new guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued new guidance regarding disclosure of going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The guidance requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within   one year   after the date that the financial statements are issued at each annual and interim reporting period. This new guidance will be effective for the Company s first quarter of 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this new guidance will have a material effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance which outlined a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance which clarifies the guidance related to (a) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard s principal versus agent guidance and (b) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard s control principle. In April 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to provide more detailed guidance including additional implementation guidance and examples related to a) identifying performance obligations and b) licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB amended the standard to clarify the guidance on assessing collectibility, presenting sales taxes, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. This new guidance will be effective for the Company's first quarter of 2018 and requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this new guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as well as the available transition methods.

              (2)  
    Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the seed investment in MLO as if it had been an equity method investment in those periods. Accordingly, unrealized losses in the amount of   $(4,755,000)   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and   $(6,506,000)   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. 
     The Cohen   Steers Low Duration Preferred and Income Fund, Inc. (LPX), launched by the Company in December 2015, is an open-end fund for which the Company is the investment adviser. LPX is a VOE and the Company owned the majority of the outstanding voting interests in the fund through February 29, 2016. Accordingly, the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of LPX had been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements with the third-party interests classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest. As a result of additional third-party subscriptions into the fund, effective March 1, 2016, the Company no longer owned the majority of the outstanding voting interest in LPX, however it was determined that the Company has significant influence over the financial decisions of LPX and therefore records its investment in LPX using the equity method of accounting. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's ownership in LPX was approximately   23%  .

The Cohen   Steers SICAV Global Listed Infrastructure Fund (GLI SICAV), a Luxembourg-domiciled undertaking for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS), was launched by the Company in September 2015, and meets the definition of an investment company. The Company is the investment adviser of GLI SICAV for which it receives a management fee. GLI SICAV is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was the only investor in the fund and therefore, the Company would absorb all of the expected losses and residual returns of GLI SICAV. Accordingly, the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of GLI SICAV have been included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The following represents the portion of the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition attributable to the consolidated GLI SICAV as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  The Cohen   Steers Active Commodities Fund, LP (ACOM), launched by the Company in April 2013, is structured as a partnership. The Company is the investment adviser of ACOM for which it is entitled to receive a management fee. The Company determined that ACOM was not a VIE as the limited partners, unaffiliated with the Company, have the ability to liquidate the fund with a majority vote. As a result, the Company does not have financial control and ACOM is not consolidated into the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company's equity interest in ACOM represents a seed investment to launch the fund, adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of the fund's earnings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's ownership in ACOM was approximately   10%  ; however, as the general partner, the Company has significant influence over the financial decisions of ACOM and therefore records its investment in ACOM using the equity method of accounting. 
  Cohen   Steers Global Realty Partners III-TE, L.P. (GRP-TE), which had its closing in October 2011, is structured as a partnership. The Company is the general partner and investment adviser of GRP-TE, for which it receives a management fee and is entitled to receive an incentive distribution, if earned. GRP-TE is a VIE and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. As the general partner, the Company has significant influence over the financial decisions of GRP-TE and therefore records its investment using the equity method of accounting. The Company's equity interest in GRP-TE represents a seed investment to launch the fund, adjusted for the Company s proportionate share of the fund s earnings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's ownership in GRP-TE was approximately   0.2%  . The Company's risk with respect to its investment in GRP-TE is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management fees. In conjunction with the launch of GRP-TE, the Company established Cohen   Steers Co-Investment Partnership, L.P. (GRP-CIP), which is used by

As of   September 30, 2016  , GRP-CIP is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary as it owns all of the voting interest in GRP-CIP. Accordingly, the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of GRP-CIP have been included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  The following represents the portion of the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition attributable to the consolidated GRP-CIP as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The assets may only be used to settle obligations of GRP-CIP and the liabilities are the sole obligation of GRP-CIP, for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company (in thousands): 

MLO, launched by the Company in December 2013, is an open-end fund for which the Company is the investment adviser. MLO is a VOE and it was determined that the Company had significant influence over the financial decisions of MLO, and therefore through April 30, 2015, the Company recorded its investment in MLO using the equity method of accounting. Effective May 1, 2015, the Company's ownership interest in MLO fell below   20%   and the Company no longer had significant influence over MLO. Accordingly, the Company began recording its investment in MLO as an available-for-sale investment.  
  During the three months ended December 31, 2015, MLO changed classification from available-for-sale to equity method. As a result, all prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this investment as if it had been an equity method investment in prior periods. Accordingly, unrealized losses in the amount of   $(4,755,000)   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and   $(6,506,000)   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. Effective June 1, 2016, the Company's ownership interest in MLO fell below   20%   and the Company no longer has significant influence over MLO. Accordingly, the Company began recording its investment in MLO as an available-for-sale investment. 
  Cohen   Steers Real Assets Fund, Inc. (RAP), launched by the Company in January 2012, is an open-end fund for which the Company is the investment adviser. RAP is a VOE.

  Available-for-sale investments with a fair value of approximately   $2,563,000   and   $1,779,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were in an unrealized loss position. 
  Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments as of   September 30, 2016   were generally caused by market conditions. When evaluating whether an unrealized loss on an available-for-sale investment is other than temporary, the Company reviews such factors as the extent and duration of the loss, as well as qualitative and quantitative information about the financial condition and near term prospects of the funds. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that it had the ability and intent to hold the remaining investments for which no other-than-temporary impairment has occurred until a recovery of fair value. Accordingly, impairment of these investments is considered temporary.

5. Fair Value 
  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement   (ASC 820) specifies a hierarchy of valuation classifications based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used in each valuation classification are observable or unobservable. These classifications are summarized in the   three   broad levels listed below: 
             
    Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
                
    Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable. 
                
    Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
     Inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, in which case the Company defaults to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with the investments. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performed a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 820. Transfers among levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period. There were no such transfers noted during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table presents fair value measurements as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

  Realized and unrealized gains (losses) from investments classified as trading investments in the above table were recorded as gain (loss) from trading investments in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
  Valuation Techniques 
  In certain instances, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable brokers/dealers or independent pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, independent pricing services may use information with respect to transactions in such investments, broker quotes, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. As part of its independent price verification process, the Company selectively performs detailed reviews of valuations provided by broker/dealers or independent pricing services. Investments in Company-sponsored funds are valued at their closing price or NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.

Foreign exchange contracts are valued by interpolating a value using the spot foreign exchange rate and forward points (based on the spot rate and currency interest rate differentials), which are all inputs that are observable in active markets (level 2). 
  In the absence of observable market prices, the Company values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments, little market activity may exist; management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances, and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors. Such investments are valued on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration any changes in key inputs and changes in economic and other relevant conditions, and valuation models are updated accordingly. The valuation process also includes a review by the Company's valuation committee which is comprised of senior members from various departments within the Company, including investment management. The valuation committee provides independent oversight of the valuation policies and procedures. 
  The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the following level 3 investments as of   September 30, 2016   were:

7. Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the total weighted average shares of common stock outstanding and common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are comprised of dilutive potential shares from restricted stock unit awards. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method. 
  Anti-dilutive common stock equivalents of approximately   19,000   shares were excluded from the computation for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Anti-dilutive common stock equivalents of approximately   90,000   and   36,000   shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

The following is a reconciliation of the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share data): 

8. Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the effective tax rate was approximately   38.2%   and   48.3%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 included the effect of recording a valuation allowance on the tax benefit associated with the retroactive adjustment to record the unrealized losses on one of the Company's seed investments as a result of a change in accounting classification. The effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   included the cumulative effect to adjust the estimated tax rate to   37.2%   for the full year 2016. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   was approximately   37.2%   and   40.8%  , respectively. The Company expects the tax rate for the full year 2016 to approximate   37.2%  , excluding discrete items. 
  Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of the temporary differences between book and tax basis and are measured using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse. The Company's net deferred tax asset is primarily comprised of future income tax deductions attributable to the delivery of unvested restricted stock units. The Company records a valuation allowance, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized. 

9. Regulatory Requirements 
  CSS, a registered broker/dealer in the U.S., is subject to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 (the Rule), which requires that broker/dealers maintain a minimum level of net capital, as prescribed under the Rule. As of   September 30, 2016  , CSS had net capital of approximately   $2,764,000  , which exceeded its requirements by approximately   $2,572,000  . The Rule also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if the resulting net capital of a broker/dealer is less than the amount required under the Rule and requires prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. In July 2016, CSCM made a capital contribution into CSS in the amount of   $2 million  . 
  CSS does not carry customer accounts and is exempt from SEC Rule 15c3-3 pursuant to provisions (k)(1) and (k)(2)(i) of such rule. 
  CSAL and CSUK are regulated outside the U.S. by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , CSAL and CSUK had aggregate regulatory

Sales proceeds, gross realized gains, gross realized losses and dividend income from available-for-sale investments in Company-sponsored funds for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 are summarized below (in thousands): 

The Company has agreements with certain affiliated open-end and closed-end funds to reimburse certain fund expenses. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , expenses of approximately   $2,273,000   and $  1,998,000  , respectively, were incurred by the Company pursuant to these agreements and are included in general and administrative expenses. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , fund reimbursement expenses of approximately   $6,096,000   and   $6,476,000  , respectively, were incurred.

11. Commitments and Contingencies 
  From time to time, the Company is involved in legal matters relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. There are currently no such matters pending that the Company believes could have a material adverse effect on its condensed consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
  The Company periodically commits to fund a portion of the equity in certain of its sponsored investment products.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has funded approximately   $3.3 million   with respect to this commitment. The actual timing for funding the unfunded portion of this commitment is currently unknown, as the drawdown of the Company's unfunded commitment is contingent on the timing of drawdowns by the underlying funds and co-investments in which GRP-TE invests. The unfunded

Such information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included herein.

Executive Overview 
  General 
  We are a global investment manager specializing in liquid real assets, including real estate securities, listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, as well as preferred securities and other income solutions. Founded in 1986, we are headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seattle. 
  Our primary investment strategies include U.S. real estate securities, global/international real estate securities, global listed infrastructure, master limited partnerships (MLPs), commodities, multi-strategy real assets, preferred securities and large cap value. Our strategies seek to achieve a variety of investment objectives for different risk profiles and are actively managed by specialist teams of investment professionals who employ fundamental-driven research and portfolio management processes. We offer our strategies through a variety of investment vehicles, including U.S. registered funds and other commingled vehicles and separate accounts, including subadvised portfolios for financial institutions around the world. 
  Our products and services are marketed through multiple distribution channels. We distribute our U.S. registered funds principally through financial intermediaries, including broker/dealers, registered investment advisers, banks and fund supermarkets. Our funds domiciled in Europe are marketed to individual and institutional investors through financial intermediaries, as well as privately to institutional investors. Our institutional clients include corporate and public defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, endowment funds and foundations, insurance companies and other financial institutions that access our investment management services directly, through consultants or through other intermediaries. 
  Our revenue is derived from investment advisory fees received from our clients, including fees for managing or sub-advising client accounts, and investment advisory, administration, distribution and service fees received from Company-sponsored open-end and closed-end funds. Our fees are paid in arrears, based on contractually specified percentages of the value of the assets we manage. Our revenue fluctuates with changes in the total value of our assets under management, which may occur as a result of our investment decisions, market conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, or investor subscriptions or redemptions, and is recognized over the period that the assets are managed.  
  Quarterly Highlights 
  Revenue increased   9%   from the second quarter of 2016 to   $94.4 million   for the third quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management in all three investment vehicles and one additional day in the quarter. Operating income increased   9%   from the second quarter of 2016 to   $37.2 million   for the third quarter of 2016. Operating margin decreased to   39.4%   for the third quarter of 2016 compared with   39.5%   for the second quarter of 2016. Our effective tax rate was   38.2%   for the third quarter of 2016. 
  Assets under management increased by   $1.7 billion  , or   3%  , in the third quarter of 2016 from   $58.7 billion   as of   June 30, 2016   to   $60.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . The increase was driven by net inflows and market appreciation, partially offset by distributions. Average assets under management increased by   8%   during the third quarter of 2016 from   $55.9 billion   during the second quarter of 2016 to   $60.5 billion   during the third quarter of 2016. Our overall annualized organic growth rate was   15%   for the third quarter of 2016. The organic growth rate represents the ratio of annualized net flows for the quarter to the beginning assets under management. 
  Third Quarter 2016 Business Developments 
  In August 2016, we hired a new head of funds and subadvisory sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He will play a critical role in developing relationships with financial intermediaries in that region, raising awareness of Cohen   Steers' expertise in liquid real assets and income solutions.

  General and administrative expenses increased   8%   to   $13.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $12.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher information technology expenses of approximately $347,000, marketing expenses of approximately $306,000 and rent and occupancy costs of approximately $192,000. 
  Operating Margin 
  Operating margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   39.4%  , compared with   39.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Non-operating Income 
  Non-operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.4 million  , compared with non-operating loss of   $7.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our seed investments. Non-operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 included an unrealized loss in the amount of $4.8 million that, due to a change in accounting classification, has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this unrealized loss on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Non-operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $46,000  . Non-operating loss for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   included net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $129,000  . 
  Income Taxes 
  Income tax expense was   $14.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $11.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The provision for income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes at an approximate effective tax rate of   38.2%  , which included the cumulative effect to adjust our estimated tax rate to 37.2% for the year. The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was approximately   48.3%   which included the effect of recording a valuation allowance on the tax benefit associated with the retroactive adjustment to record the unrealized losses on one of the company's seed investments as a result of a change in accounting classification. We expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to approximate   37.2%  , excluding discrete items. 
  Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared with   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  Revenue 
  Total revenue increased   5%   to   $260.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $247.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily attributable to higher investment advisory and administration fees of   $9.8 million  , primarily resulting from higher average assets under management in institutional accounts and open-end funds. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :  
             
    Total investment advisory revenue from institutional accounts increased   9%   to   $69.9 million   from   $64.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Total investment advisory revenue compared with average assets under management in institutional accounts implies an annualized effective fee rate of 33 bps for both the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

34 

Total investment advisory and administration revenue from open-end funds increased   8%   to   $110.8 million   from   $102.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Total investment advisory and administration revenue compared with average assets under management in open-end funds implies an annualized effective fee rate of 78 bps and 79 bps for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
                
    Total investment advisory and administration revenue from closed-end funds decreased   7%   to   $57.5 million   from   $61.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Employee compensation and benefits increased   9%   to   $87.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $80.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation of approximately $3.4 million, salaries of approximately $2.3 million, and higher production compensation of approximately $2.1 million, partially offset by lower severance of $400,000. 
  Distribution and service fee expenses increased   8%   to   $29.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $27.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds.  
  General and administrative expenses increased   2%   to   $38.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $37.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees of approximately $541,000, higher rent and occupancy costs of approximately $516,000, and increased information technology expenses of approximately $465,000, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment of approximately $451,000 and recruiting fees of approximately $292,000. 
  Operating Margin 
  Operating margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   38.3%  , compared with   39.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Non-operating Income 
  Non-operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.5 million  , compared with non-operating loss of   $9.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our seed investments. Non-operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included an unrealized loss in the amount of $6.5 million that, due to a change in accounting classification, has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this unrealized loss on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Non-operating income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $149,000  . Non-operating loss for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   included net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $163,000  .

The provision for income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes at an approximate effective tax rate of   37.2%  . The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was approximately   40.8%  . We expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to approximate   37.2%  , excluding discrete items.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
  Management believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures may enhance the evaluation of our results, as they provide greater transparency into our operating results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to prepare our internal management reports and by management in evaluating our business.  
  While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our results and operating performance, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our investment advisory business does not require us to maintain significant capital balances. Our current financial condition is highly liquid, with a significant amount of our assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents, equity method investments, available-for-sale investments and accounts receivable (together, liquid assets). Our cash flows generally result from the operating activities of our business, with investment advisory and administration fees being the most significant contributor. Cash and cash equivalents, equity method investments (excluding investments measured at NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement)  , available-for-sale investments and accounts receivable, were 80% and 71% of total assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Cash and cash equivalents increased   $22.1 million  , excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, over the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net cash provided by operating activities was   $60.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Net cash provided by investing activities was   $1.0 million  , which included proceeds from sales of available-for-sale investments in the amount of   $15.2 million  , partially offset by purchases of property and equipment in the amount of   $7.4 million   and purchases of available-for-sale investments in the amount of   $7.2 million  . Net cash of   $39.7 million   was used in financing activities, primarily for dividends paid to stockholders of   $35.9 million   and repurchases of common stock to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations on the vesting and delivery of restricted stock units of   $8.0 million  , partially offset by contributions from redeemable noncontrolling interest of   $3.9 million  . 

38 

Cash and cash equivalents increased   $21.7 million  , excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, over the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net cash provided by operating activities was   $68.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net cash provided by investing activities was   $1.2 million  , which included proceeds from sales of available-for-sale investments in the amount of   $7.0 million  , partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale investments in the amount of   $4.1 million   and purchases of property and equipment in the amount of   $1.6 million  . Net cash of   $47.9 million   was used in financing activities, primarily for dividends paid to stockholders of   $34.1 million   and repurchases of common stock to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations on the vesting and delivery of restricted stock units of   $19.2 million  , partially offset by excess tax benefits associated with the vesting and delivery of restricted stock units of   $4.7 million  . 
  We continuously monitor and evaluate the adequacy of our capital. We have consistently maintained net capital in excess of the regulatory requirements for our broker/dealer, as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker/dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. At   September 30, 2016  , we exceeded our minimum regulatory capital requirements by approximately   $2.6 million  . During July 2016, Cohen   Steers Capital Management, Inc. made a capital contribution of $2 million into Cohen   Steers Securities, LLC. 
  Cohen   Steers Asia Limited (CSAL) and Cohen   Steers UK Limited (CSUK) are regulated outside the U.S. by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , CSAL and CSUK exceeded their aggregate minimum regulatory capital requirements by approximately   $66.6 million  . We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated capital requirements and other obligations as they become due. 
  Included in cash and cash equivalents was approximately $88.8 million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  . It is our current intention to permanently reinvest funds held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We believe that our liquid assets held in the U.S. are more than sufficient to cover our working capital needs in the U.S. 
  We periodically commit to fund a portion of the equity in certain of our sponsored investment products. We have committed to co-invest up to $5.1 million alongside Cohen   Steers Global Realty Partners III-TE, L.P. (GRP-TE). As of   September 30, 2016  , we have funded approximately $3.3 million with respect to this commitment. Our co-investment alongside GRP-TE is illiquid and is anticipated to be invested for the life of the fund. The timing of the funding of the unfunded portion of our commitment is currently unknown, as the drawdown of our commitment is contingent on the timing of drawdowns by the underlying funds and co-investments in which GRP-TE invests. The unfunded portion of this commitment was not recorded on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of   September 30, 2016   or December 31, 2015. 
  Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 
  We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our noncancelable long-term operating leases for office space, information technology applications and office equipment. There were no material capital lease obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . The following summarizes our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support, or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  A complete discussion of our critical accounting policies is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 31.1 
  Chief Executive Officer Certification  
  As Adopted Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  
  I, Robert H. Steers, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   of Cohen   Steers, Inc. (the Registrant);  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  
              4. 
    The Registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have:  
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and  
              5. 
    The Registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
