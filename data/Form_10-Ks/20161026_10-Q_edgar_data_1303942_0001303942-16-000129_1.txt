  NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued) 

Basis of Presentation  : BankFinancial Corporation, a Maryland corporation headquartered in Burr Ridge, Illinois, is the owner of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of BankFinancial, F.S.B. (the  Bank ). The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of and transactions of BankFinancial Corporation, the Bank, and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Financial Assurance Services, Inc. and BF Asset Recovery Corporation (collectively,  the Company ), and reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Use of Estimates  : To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and future results could differ. 
  Reclassifications  : Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior period s financial statements to conform them to the current period s presentation. 
  These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update originally were to become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. During 2015, the FASB delayed the effectiveness by one year to annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities). The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring: equity investments (other than equity method or consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets (i.e. securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities; eliminating the requirement for non-public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is to be required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from the change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as  own credit ) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective

for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ).  These amendments require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019 (i.e., January 1, 2020, for calendar year entities).  Early application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
   
  NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Amounts reported in earnings per share reflect earnings available to common stockholders for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, exclusive of unearned ESOP shares and unvested restricted stock shares. Stock options and restricted stock are regarded as potential common stock and are considered in the diluted earnings per share calculations to the extent that they would have a dilutive effect if converted to common stock.

  NOTE 3 - SECURITIES 

The fair value of securities and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are shown below. 

The mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations reflected in the preceding table were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities or agencies, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae, and are obligations which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. All securities reflected in the preceding table were classified as available-for-sale at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The amortized cost and fair values of securities by contractual maturity are shown below. Securities not due at a single maturity date are shown separately. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

Sales of securities were as follows:

  NOTE 3 - SECURITIES   (continued) 

Securities with unrealized losses not recognized in income are as follows: 

The Company evaluates marketable investment securities with significant declines in fair value on a quarterly basis to determine whether they should be considered other-than-temporarily impaired under current accounting guidance, which generally provides that if a marketable security is in an unrealized loss position, whether due to general market conditions or industry or issuer-specific factors, the holder of the securities must assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. 
  Certain collateralized mortgage obligations that the Company holds in its investment portfolio were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  , but the unrealized losses were not considered significant under the Company s impairment testing methodology.  In addition, the Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is likely that the Company will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery occurs.

The following represents the components of recorded investment: 
  Loan principal balance 
  Less unapplied payments 
  Plus negative unapplied balance 
  Less escrow balance 
  Plus negative escrow balance 
  Plus unamortized net deferred loan costs

Nonaccrual Loans 
  The following tables present the recorded investment in nonaccrual loans and loans past due over 90 days still on accrual by class of loans: 

Nonaccrual loans and impaired loans are defined differently. Some loans may be included in both categories, and some may only be included in one category. Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. 
  The Company s reserve for uncollected loan interest was   $238,000   and   $181,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. When a loan is on nonaccrual status and the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. Alternatively, when a loan is on non-accrual status but there is doubt concerning only the ultimate collectability of interest, contractual interest is credited to interest income only when received, under the cash basis method pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC 310 10, as applicable. In all cases, the average balances are calculated based on the month end balances of the financing receivables within the period reported pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC 310 10, as applicable.

The following tables present the aging of the recorded investment of loans at   December 31, 2015   by class of loans: 

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  The Company evaluates loan extensions or modifications in accordance with FASB ASC 310 40 with respect to the classification of the loan as a Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR"). In general, if the Company grants a loan extension or modification to a borrower for other than an insignificant period of time that includes a below market interest rate, principal forgiveness, payment forbearance or other concession intended to minimize the economic loss to the Company, the loan extension or loan modification is classified as a TDR. In cases where borrowers are granted new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal then due and payable, management measures any impairment on the restructured loan in the same manner as for impaired loans as noted above. 
  The Company had   $413,000   of TDRs at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .    No   specific valuation reserves were allocated to those loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company had   no   outstanding commitments to borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs at either date.  During the first quarter of 2016, six loans totaling   $1.5 million   were declassified as TDRs as they successfully met the criteria for removal from TDR status. 
  The following table presents loans classified as TDRs:

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the terms of certain loans were modified and classified as TDRs. The modification of the terms of such loans included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan.  
  The following tables present TDR activity:

The following table presents TDRs for which there was a payment default during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and    2015   within twelve months following the modification. 

A TDR is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 
  The TDRs for which there was a payment default resulted in   no   change to the allowance for loan losses allocated and resulted in   no   charge-offs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The TDRs for which there was a payment default resulted in   no   change to the allowance for loan losses allocated and resulted in   no   charge-offs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  There were certain other loan modifications during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   that did not meet the definition of a TDR. These loans had a total recorded investment of   $615,000   and   $2.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The modification of these loans involved either a modification of the terms of a loan to borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulties or a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant.  
  In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting policy. 
   
  Credit Quality Indicators 
  The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, including current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans based on credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed on a monthly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
  Special Mention.   A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
  Substandard.   Loans categorized as Substandard continue to accrue interest, but exhibit a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. The loans continue to accrue interest because they are well secured and collection of principal and interest is expected within a reasonable time. The risk rating guidance published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency clarifies that a loan with a well-defined weakness does not have to present a probability of default for the loan to be rated Substandard, and that an individual loan s loss potential does not have to be distinct for the loan to be rated Substandard. 
  Nonaccrual.   An asset classified Nonaccrual has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  The loans were placed on nonaccrual status. 
  Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered  Pass  rated loans.

  NOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED 

R  eal estate that is acquired through foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned ("OREO") until it is sold. When real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, it is recorded at its fair value, less the estimated costs of disposal. If the fair value of the property is less than the loan balance, the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses. 

The following represents the roll forward of OREO and the composition of OREO properties: 

Activity in the valuation allowance is as follows:

  NOTE 6 - SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE (continued) 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were secured by mortgage-backed securities with a carrying amount of   $5.3 million   and   $6.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Also included in total borrowings were advances from the FHLBC of   $62.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  ; there were   no   outstanding advances at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Because security values fluctuate due to market conditions, the Company has no control over the market value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase.  The Company is obligated to promptly transfer additional securities to the counterparty if the market value of the securities falls below the repurchase price, per the agreement. 
   
  NOTE 7 - FAIR VALUE 
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 
             
    Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2   Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
     The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 
  Securities  : The fair values of marketable equity securities are generally determined by quoted prices, in active markets, for each specific security (Level 1). If Level 1 measurement inputs are not available for a marketable equity security, we determine its fair value based on the quoted price of a similar security traded in an active market (Level 2). The fair values of debt securities are generally determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2). 
  Impaired Loans:   The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available for similar loans and collateral underlying such loans. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted in accordance with the allowance policy. 
  Other Real Estate Owned:   Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.

NOTE 7 - FAIR VALUE   (continued) 

Mortgage Servicing Rights  : On a quarterly basis, loan servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. The fair values of mortgage servicing rights are based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The Company is able to compare the valuation model inputs and results to widely available published industry data for reasonableness (Level 2). 
  The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets that were accounted for at fair value and are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table sets forth the Company s assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis: 

Impaired loans that are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and which have specific valuation allowances had a carrying amount of   $385,000  , with a valuation allowance of   $39,000   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a carrying amount of   $557,000   and a valuation allowance of   $44,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease in the provision for loan losses of   $5,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  There was a decrease in the provision for loan losses of   $384,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  OREO, which is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell, had a carrying value of   $3.2 million   less a valuation allowance of   $398,000  , or   $2.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a carrying value of   $2.5 million   less a valuation allowance of   $881,000  , or   $1.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . There were   $244,000   of valuation adjustments of OREO recorded for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  There were   $467,000   of valuation adjustments of OREO recorded for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Mortgage servicing rights, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, had a carrying amount of   $240,000   at   September 30, 2016  , and a carrying amount of   $281,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  There was   no   pre-tax provision for our mortgage servicing rights

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments are as follows: 

For purposes of the above, the following assumptions were used: 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  : The estimated fair values for cash and cash equivalents are based on their carrying value due to the short-term nature of these assets. 
  Loans  : The estimated fair value for loans has been determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows based on the current rate the Company would charge for similar loans with similar maturities, applied for an estimated time period until the loan is assumed to be repriced or repaid.  
  FHLBC Stock  : It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLBC stock due to the restrictions placed on its transferability.

  NOTE 7 - FAIR VALUE   (continued) 

NOTE 7 - FAIR VALUE   (continued) 

Deposit Liabilities  : The estimated fair value for certificates of deposit has been determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows based on estimates of rates the Company would pay on such deposits, applied for the time period until maturity. The estimated fair values of noninterest-bearing demand, NOW, money market, and savings deposits are assumed to approximate their carrying values as management establishes rates on these deposits at a level that approximates the local market area. Additionally, these deposits can be withdrawn on demand. 
  Borrowings  : The estimated fair values of advances from the FHLBC and notes payable are based on current market rates for similar financing. The estimated fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase is assumed to equal its carrying value due to the short-term nature of the liability. 
  Accrued Interest  : The estimated fair values of accrued interest receivable and payable are assumed to equal their carrying value. 
  Off  -  Balance-Sheet Instruments  : Off-balance-sheet items consist principally of unfunded loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and unused lines of credit. The estimated fair values of unfunded loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and unused lines of credit are not material. 
  While the above estimates are based on management s judgment of the most appropriate factors, as of the balance sheet date, there is no assurance that the estimated fair values would have been realized if the assets were disposed of or the liabilities settled at that date, since market values may differ depending on the various circumstances. The estimated fair values would also not apply to subsequent dates. 
  In addition, other assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments, such as premises and equipment, are not included in the above disclosures.

    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
     Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
  Forward Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and other periodic and current reports, press releases and other public stockholder communications of BankFinancial Corporation may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to our future plans, strategies and expectations, as well as our future revenues, earnings, losses, financial performance, financial condition, asset quality metrics and future prospects. Forward looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words  believe,   may,   will,   should,   could,   expect,   estimate,   intend,   anticipate,   project,   plan,  or similar expressions. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date made. They are frequently based on assumptions that may or may not materialize, and are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements. We intend all forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for the purpose of invoking these safe harbor provisions. 
  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or projected and which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or future prospects include, but are not limited to: (i) less than anticipated loan growth due to intense competition for high quality loans and leases, particularly in terms of pricing and credit underwriting, or a dearth of borrowers who meet our underwriting standards; (ii) the impact of re-pricing and competitors  pricing initiatives on loan and deposit products; (iii) interest rate movements and their impact on the economy, customer behavior and our net interest margin; (iv) adverse economic conditions in general, in the Chicago metropolitan area in particular and in other market areas where we operate that could result in increased delinquencies in our loan portfolio or a decline in the value of our investment securities and the collateral for our loans; (v) declines in real estate values that adversely impact the value of our loan collateral, OREO, asset dispositions and the level of borrower equity in their investments; (vi) borrowers that experience legal or financial difficulties that we do not currently foresee; (vii) results of supervisory monitoring or examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that a regulatory authority could, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or adversely change our loan classifications, write-down assets, reduce credit concentrations or maintain specific capital levels; (viii) changes, disruptions or illiquidity in national or global financial markets; (ix) the credit risks of lending activities, including risks that could cause changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs or changes in estimates relating to the computation

Table of Contents  

of our allowance for loan losses; (x) monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; (xi) factors affecting our ability to access deposits or cost-effective funding, and the impact of competitors' pricing initiatives on our deposit products; (xii) the impact of new legislation or regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, on our products, services, operations and operating expenses; (xiii) higher federal deposit insurance premiums; (xiv) higher than expected overhead, infrastructure and compliance costs; (xv) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; and (xvi) privacy and cybersecurity risks, including the risks of business interruption and the compromise of confidential customer information resulting from intrusions. 
  These risks and uncertainties, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as other filings we make with the SEC, should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the future, or to reflect circumstances and events that occur after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operation depend, and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments, are included in the discussion entitled  Critical Accounting Policies  in Item 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , and all amendments thereto, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Overview 
  Total loans increased due to stronger originations in commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases and multi-family loans.  Total commercial-related loan balances reached a new record level of $1.1 billion, and now comprise 88.4% of total loans. We are encouraged by an increase in loan opportunities in all commercial-related loan segments, but it remains difficult to predict the quantity of new loan originations due to the various competitive factors we encounter.   
  The combination of our existing loan prospects and the success of our continuing marketing efforts provide us reason to believe that commercial-related loan originations should achieve meaningful net growth during the remainder of 2016.  As previously announced, we are in the process of seeking the necessary regulatory approvals to convert to a national bank to eliminate the existing statutory limits on the composition of our commercial loan and lease portfolio. 
  Our average yield on loans remained stable and our net interest margin increased modestly due to the relative composition of new loan originations and a decline in higher-yield loan payoffs during the quarter.  Non-interest income increased modestly due primarily to slightly higher deposit-account related income and other income. Non-interest expense continues to decline in line with our expectations for 2016.  
  Past due and classified loan trends remain favorable.  Our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.31% and our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 0.54% at September 30, 2016.  Non-performing commercial-related loans represented 0.11% of total commercial-related loans.  Non-performing asset and OREO expenses increased slightly in the third quarter due in part to real estate tax and resolution expenses, as well as a seasonally higher volume of updated valuations on non-performing assets.  We continue to focus on pro-active portfolio management and resolutions of non-performing loans and assets to maintain our asset quality and reduce non-performing asset expense to the lowest practicable levels.

  Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015 
  Total assets increased   $27.8 million  , or   1.8%  , to   $1.540 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.512 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in total assets was primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and loans.  Partially offsetting this increase was a   $14.9 million  , or   12.9%  , decrease in securities to   $99.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $114.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Loans increased   $9.6 million  , or   0.8%  , to   $1.242 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.232 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase was due in part to commercial loan and lease originations of $306.5 million in 2016, which was partially offset by year to date commercial loan and lease repayments of $248.3 million and the sale of three performing loans to a single borrower with a total carrying value of $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2016.  At   September 30, 2016  , our loan portfolio consisted of   $835.0 million   of real estate loans, which represented   66.9%   of total loans.  The Bank s primary lending area consists of the counties in the State of Illinois where our branch offices are located, and contiguous counties. We derive the most significant portion of our

revenues from these geographic areas. We also engage in multi-family     lending activities in carefully selected metropolitan areas outside our primary lending area, and engage in certain types of commercial lending and leasing activities on a nationwide basis.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $291.9 million  , or   57.8%  , of our multi-family loans were in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Chicago, Illinois, while   $54.1 million  , or   10.7%  , were in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Dallas, Texas;   $52.3 million  , or   10.4%  , were in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Denver, Colorado;   $20.7 million  , or   4.1%  , were in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Minneapolis, Minnesota; and   $16.8 million  , or   3.3%  , were in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Tampa, Florida. This information reflects the location of the collateral, but does not necessarily reflect the location of the borrower. 
  Total liabilities increased   $36.5 million  , or   2.8%  , to   $1.337 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.300 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to increases in interest-bearing NOW accounts and certificates of deposits.  The increases were partially offset by decreases in borrowings, non-interest demand accounts and money market accounts.  Total deposits increased   $103.8 million  , or   8.6%  , to   $1.317 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.213 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  Certificates of deposit increased   $120.0 million  , or   53.9%  , to   $342.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $222.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase included a   $107.4 million   increase in brokered certificates of deposit, of which $62.0 million was used to repay FHLBC advances.  Interest-bearing NOW accounts increased   $14.3 million  , or   5.74%  , to   $263.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $249.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Savings accounts decreased   $1.6 million  , or   1.0%  , to   $155.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $156.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased   $20.2 million  , or   7.9%  , to   $234.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $254.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Money market accounts decreased   $8.8 million  , or   2.68%  , to   $320.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $329.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Core deposits (which consists of savings, money market, noninterest-bearing demand and NOW accounts) were   74.0%   and   81.6%   of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Total stockholders  equity was   $203.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $212.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in total stockholders  equity was primarily due to the combined impact of our repurchase of   1,026,106   shares of our common stock at a total cost of   $12.7 million  , and our declaration and payment of cash dividends totaling   $3.0 million  , during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  These items were partially offset by the net income of   $5.2 million   that we recorded for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The unallocated shares of common stock that our ESOP owns were reflected as an   $8.6 million   reduction to stockholders  equity at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a   $9.3 million   reduction at   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Operating Results for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  Net Income.     We had net income of   $2.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net income   $2.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Earnings per basic and fully diluted share of common stock were   $0.13   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.12   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Interest Income  .    Net interest income was   $11.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.4 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in net interest income reflected a   $698,000  , or   5.7%  , increase in interest income, which was partially offset by a   $315,000  , or   45.1%  , increase in interest expense.   
  The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in net average interest-earning assets.  Total average interest-earning assets increased   $78.3 million  , or   5.86%  , to   $1.415 billion   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from $  1.336 billion   for the same period in   2015  .  Our net interest rate spread decreased by   10   basis points to   3.23%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   3.33%   for the same period in   2015  .  Our net interest margin decreased by   seven   basis points to   3.33%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   3.40%   for the same period in   2015  .  The decreases in the net interest rate spread and net interest margin resulted from increased average balances and increased costs for interest-bearing liabilities.  The yield on interest-earning assets remained at   3.61%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased   ten   basis points to   0.38%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   0.28%   for the same period in   2015  .

Provision for Loan Losses 
  We establish provisions for loan losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of nonperforming and other classified loans. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or events change. We assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance. 
  We recorded a recovery of loan losses of   $525,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a recovery of loan losses of   $956,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The provision for or recovery of loan losses is a function of the allowance for loan loss methodology that we use to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted.  The portion of the allowance for loan losses attributable to loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased   $539,000  , or   6.1%  , to   $8.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from $8.8 million at   June 30, 2016  .     The reserve established for loans individually evaluated for impairment decreased   $42,000  , or   51.9%  , to   $39,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Net charge-offs were   $56,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was   212.82%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 170.52% at   June 30, 2016  . 
  A loan balance is classified as a loss and charged-off when it is confirmed that there is no readily apparent source of repayment for the portion of the loan that is classified as loss. Confirmation can occur upon the receipt of updated third-party appraisal valuation information indicating that there is a low probability of repayment upon sale of the collateral, the final disposition of collateral where the net proceeds are insufficient to pay the loan balance in full, our failure to obtain possession of certain consumer-loan collateral within certain time limits specified by applicable federal regulations, the conclusion of legal proceedings where the borrower s obligation to repay is legally discharged (such as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding), or when it appears that further formal collection procedures are not likely to result in net proceeds in excess of the costs to collect. 
  Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased   $72,000  , or   4.2%  , to   $1.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Deposit service charges and fees decreased   $65,000  , or   10.0%  , to   $583,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $648,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other fee income decreased   $24,000  , or   4.8%  , to   $478,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $502,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Noninterest income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included a   $38,000   gain on sale of loans.  Loan servicing fees decreased   $19,000   due to a decrease in the balance of loans serviced for others.  Other income increased   $27,000  , or   13.6%  , to   $226,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $199,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense decreased by   $320,000  , or   3.1%  , to   $9.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $10.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was due in substantial part to decreases in nonperforming asset management expenses and lower valuation adjustments for OREO.  Advertising and public relations expense decreased   $68,000  , or   32.1%  , to   $144,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $212,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Nonperforming asset management expense decreased   $155,000  , or   63.5%  , to   $89,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $244,000   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to lower legal expenses.  Valuation adjustments of OREO decreased   $116,000  , to   $115,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $231,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Other expenses included a $16,000 increase in the mortgage representation and warranty reserve for mortgage loans sold, compared to no provision or recovery in 2015 for loans serviced for others.  The amount of the warranty and representation reserve was calculated by applying published Fannie Mae data relating to the percentage of loans that it required to be repurchased due to breaches of warranties and representations to the Bank's outstanding sold loans. 
  Income Taxes 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded income tax expense of   $1.6 million  , compared to   $1.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   38.5%  , compared to   39.5%   for the same period in   2015  . 
   
  Operating Results for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Net Income.     We had net income of   $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The decline in net income was due in part to a pre-tax charge off of $1.6 million resulting from our decision to sell three performing loans to a single borrower with a total carrying value of $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2016.  Our earnings per basic and fully diluted share of common stock was   $0.27   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.33   per basic and fully diluted share for the same period in 2015. 
  Net Interest Income  .    Net interest income was   $35.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $34.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in net interest income reflected a   $1.6 million   increase in interest income, which was partially offset by a   $746,000   increase in interest expense. 
  The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in net average interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets.  Total average interest-earning assets increased   $71.3 million  , or   5.3%  , to   $1.414 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $1.343 billion   for the same period in   2015  .  Our net interest rate spread decreased by   12   basis points to   3.25%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   3.37%   for the same period in   2015  .  Our net interest margin decreased by   nine   basis point to   3.34%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   3.43%   for the same period in   2015  .  The decreases in the net interest spread and net interest margin resulted from

Provision for Loan Losses 
  We recorded a provision for loan losses of   $300,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a recovery of   $2.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The portion of the allowance for loan losses attributable to loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased   $1.4 million  , or   14.0%  , to   $8.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $9.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The reserve established for loans individually evaluated for impairment decreased   $5,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Net charge-offs were   $1.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to net recoveries of   $259,000   for the same period in   2015  .  Net charge-offs included a $1.6 million charge-off resulting from the sale of three performing loans to a single borrower with a total carrying value of $16.2 million in the second quarter of 2016.  The loans were previously discussed in the  Nonperforming Assets  section of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2015, and in a Current Report on Form 8-K that the Company filed with the SEC on June 22, 2016.  Although the loans were well-secured and supported by adequate cash flow, the Company concluded that possible future events could increase the risk of a default and subject the Company to significant legal expenses and an extended resolution period.  The Company therefore elected to pursue a resolution that would result in a finite, known consequence rather than pursue alternative resolution strategies that presented multiple uncertainties and risks that were difficult to quantify. 
  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was   212.82%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   271.30%   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased by   $166,000  , or   3.4%  , to   $4.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $4.9 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Deposit service charges and fees increased   $46,000  , or   2.8%  , to   $1.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.6 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase reflects increased charges for savings accounts.  Other fee income decreased   $160,000  , or   9.8%  , to   $1.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The decrease reflects decreased ATM and visa debit card charges and other loan fees.  Noninterest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included a   $59,000   gain on sale of loans, compared to a   $92,000   gain on sale of loans for the same period in   2015  .  Loan servicing fees decreased   $57,000   due to a decrease in the balance of loans serviced for others.

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense increased by   $572,000  , or   1.9%  , to   $31.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $30.8 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Compensation and benefits expense increased   $833,000  , or   5.1%  , due in substantial part to an $875,000 stock-based compensation expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to a $351,000 stock-based compensation expense for the same period in   2015  .  Expenses for office occupancy and equipment and supplies, telephone and postage decreased as a result of efficiency reviews.  Operations of OREO increased   $135,000  , or   33.4%  , to   $539,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $404,000   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase reflects a $236,000 decrease in rental income and a $51,000 increase in repair and maintenance expense, which were partially offset by a decrease of $102,000 in receiver fees.  Other expenses included a $150,000 increase in mortgage representation and warranty reserve for mortgage loans sold, compared to a loss of $68,000 recorded in 2015 for a loan serviced for others.  The amount of the warranty and representation reserve was calculated by applying published Fannie Mae data relating to the percentage of loans that it required to be repurchased due to breaches of warranties and representations to the Bank's outstanding sold loans. 
  Income Taxes 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $3.2 million   of income tax expense, compared to   $4.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Our effective tax rate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   38.2%  , compared to   39.3%   for the same period in   2015  . 
   
  Nonperforming Loans and Assets 
  We review loans on a regular basis, and generally place loans on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. In addition, the Company places loans on nonaccrual status when we do not expect to receive full payment of interest or principal. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed from interest income. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are recognized in accordance with our significant accounting policies. Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the borrower must generally demonstrate at least six months of payment performance before the loan is eligible to return to accrual status. We may have loans classified as 90 days or more delinquent and still accruing. Generally, we do not utilize this category of loan classification unless: (1) the loan is repaid in full shortly after the period end date; (2) the loan is well secured and there are no asserted or pending legal barriers to its collection; or (3) the borrower has remitted all scheduled payments and is otherwise in substantial compliance with the terms of the loan, but the processing of loan payments actually received or the renewal of the loan has not occurred for administrative reasons. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   loans in this category. 
  We typically obtain new third party appraisals or collateral valuations when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, conduct impairment testing or conduct a TDR analysis unless the existing valuation information for the collateral is sufficiently current to comply with the requirements of our Appraisal and Collateral Valuation Policy ( ACV Policy ). We also obtain new third party  

38 

Table of Contents  

appraisals or collateral valuations when the judicial foreclosure process concludes with respect to real estate collateral, and when we otherwise acquire actual or constructive title to real estate collateral. In addition to third party appraisals, we use updated valuation information based on Multiple Listing Service data, broker opinions of value, actual sales prices of similar assets sold by us and approved sales prices in response to offers to purchase similar assets owned by us to provide interim valuation information for consolidated financial statement and management purposes. Our ACV Policy establishes the maximum useful life of a real estate appraisal at 18 months. Because appraisals and updated valuations utilize historical or  ask side  data in reaching valuation conclusions, the appraised or updated valuation may or may not reflect the actual sales price that we will receive at the time of sale. 
  Real estate appraisals may include up to three approaches to value: the sales comparison approach, the income approach (for income-producing property) and the cost approach. Not all appraisals utilize all three approaches. Depending on the nature of the collateral and market conditions, we may emphasize one approach over another in determining the fair value of real estate collateral. Appraisals may also contain different estimates of value based on the level of occupancy or planned future improvements.  As-is  valuations represent an estimate of value based on current market conditions with no changes to the use or condition of the real estate collateral.  As-stabilized  or  as-completed  valuations assume the real estate collateral will be improved to a stated standard or achieve its highest and best use in terms of occupancy.  As-stabilized  or  as-completed  valuations may be subject to a present value adjustment for market conditions or the schedule of improvements. 
  As part of the asset classification process, we develop an exit strategy for real estate collateral or OREO by assessing overall market conditions, the current use and condition of the asset, and its highest and best use. For most income producing real estate, we believe that investors value most highly a stable income stream from the asset; consequently, we perform a comparative evaluation to determine whether conducting a sale on an  as is ,  as stabilized  or  as completed  basis is most likely to produce the highest net realizable value. If we determine that the  as stabilized  or  as completed  basis is appropriate, we then complete the necessary improvements or tenant stabilization tasks, with the applicable time value discount and improvement expenses incorporated into our estimates of the expected costs to sell. As of   September 30, 2016  , substantially all impaired real estate loan collateral and OREO were valued on an  as is basis.  
  Estimates of the net realizable value of real estate collateral also include a deduction for the expected costs to sell the collateral or such other deductions from the cash flows resulting from the operation and liquidation of the asset as are appropriate. For most real estate collateral subject to the judicial foreclosure process, we generally apply a 10.0% deduction to the value of the asset to determine the expected costs to sell the asset. This estimate includes one year of real estate taxes, sales commissions and miscellaneous repair and closing costs. If we receive a purchase offer that requires unbudgeted repairs, or if the expected resolution period for the asset exceeds one year, we then include, on a case-by-case basis, the costs of the additional real estate taxes and repairs and any other material holding costs in the expected costs to sell the collateral. For OREO, we generally apply a 7.0% deduction to determine the expected costs to sell, as expenses for real estate taxes and repairs are expensed when incurred.

Nonperforming Assets Summary 
  The following table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. 

Nonperforming Assets 
  Nonperforming assets totaled $  8.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $10.6 million   at each of   June 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Nonperforming assets decreased   $2.3 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Although we experience occasional isolated instances of new nonaccrual loans, we believe that continuing our aggressive resolution posture will maintain the trends favoring very strong asset quality. 
  Three residential real estate loans and one nonresidential real estate loan with a book balance of   $215,000   were transferred from nonaccrual loans to OREO during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  We continue to experience modest quantities of defaults on residential real estate loans principally due either to the borrower s personal financial condition or deteriorated collateral value. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity.   The overall objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash funds to meet all financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. We manage liquidity in order to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. 
  Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and, to a lesser extent, wholesale borrowings, the proceeds from maturing securities and short-term investments, and the proceeds from the sales of loans and securities and lease payments. The scheduled amortization of loans and securities, as well as proceeds from borrowings, are predictable sources of funds. Other funding sources, however, such as deposit inflows, mortgage prepayments and mortgage loan sales are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments and lines of credit and maturing certificates of deposit that are not renewed or extended. We generally remain fully invested and utilize additional sources of funds through FHLBC advances.  We had   no   FHLBC advances at   September 30, 2016  , and   $62.0 million   of FHLBC advances at   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no other material commitments for capital expenditures.

Capital Management 
  On September 16, 2016, the Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, filed an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to convert from a federal savings bank to a national bank.  As part of the charter conversion, the Company will apply to the Federal Reserve Board to register as a bank holding company instead of a savings and loan holding company.  The charter conversion remains subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. No timetable has been established for its completion.  If approved, the charter conversion will eliminate current restrictions on and facilitate the expansion of the Bank s commercial lending and leasing activities, including small business lending. 
  Capital Management - Bank.   The overall objectives of our capital management are to ensure the availability of sufficient capital to support loan, deposit and other asset and liability growth opportunities and to maintain capital to absorb unforeseen losses or write-downs that are inherent in the business risks associated with the banking industry. We seek to balance the need for higher capital levels to address such unforeseen risks and the goal to achieve an adequate return on the capital invested by our stockholders. 
  The Bank and the Company are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measure of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of regulatory actions.  The final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks (Basel III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019.  The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. 
  Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. 
  The Company and the Bank have each adopted Regulatory Capital Plans that require the Bank to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 7.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5% (including the Capital Conservation Buffer ("CCB")). The minimum capital ratios set forth in the Regulatory Capital Plans will be increased and other minimum capital requirements will be established if and as necessary. In accordance with the Regulatory Capital Plans, neither the Company nor the Bank will pursue any acquisition or growth opportunity, declare any dividend or conduct any stock repurchase that would cause the Bank's total risk-based capital ratio and/or its Tier 1 leverage ratio to fall below the established minimum capital levels or the capital levels required for capital adequacy plus the CCB.  The minimum CCB in 2016 is 0.625% and will increase 0.625% annually through 2019 to 2.5%.  In addition, the Company will continue to maintain its ability to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank by holding at least $5.0 million of cash or liquid assets for that purpose.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank and the Company were well-capitalized, with all capital ratios exceeding the well-capitalized requirement.  There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Bank s prompt corrective action capitalization category.

Actual and required capital amounts and ratios were: 

The Bank paid a dividend of $15.0 million to the Company in April 2016 to be used for general corporate purposes.  The Bank also paid a quarterly dividend of $534,000 to the Company during the third quarter of 2016. 
  Capital Management - Company.   Total stockholders  equity was   $203.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $212.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in total stockholders  equity was primarily due to the combined impact of our repurchase of   1,026,106   shares of our common stock at a total cost of   $12.7 million  , and our declaration and payment of cash dividends totaling   $3.0 million  , during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  These items were partially offset by net income of   $5.2 million   that we recorded for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The unallocated shares of common stock that our ESOP owns were reflected as a   $8.6 million   reduction to stockholders  equity at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a   $9.3 million   reduction at   December 31, 2015  .

Quarterly Cash Dividends.    The Company declared cash dividends of   $0.15   and   $0.16   per share for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Stock Repurchase Program.   On March 30, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 1,055,098 shares of the Company s common stock, which represented approximately 5% of the Company s then issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  On December 28, 2015, the Board of Directors extended this repurchase authorization from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, and increased the number of shares that can be repurchased in accordance with the authorization by 1,046,868. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had repurchased   1,830,755   shares of its common stock out of the 2,101,966 shares of common stock authorized under this repurchase authorization. 
   
  ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Qualitative Analysis.   A significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk results from timing differences in the maturity or repricing of our assets, liabilities and off balance sheet contracts (  i.e.,   forward loan commitments), the effect of loan prepayments and deposit withdrawals, the difference in the behavior of lending and funding rates arising from the use of different indices and  yield curve risk  arising from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities for constant or variable credit risk investments. In addition to directly affecting net interest income, changes in market interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans, the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings, the carrying value of investment securities classified as available-for-sale and the flow and mix of deposits. 
  The general objective of our interest rate risk management is to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy and then manage that risk in a manner that is consistent with our policy to reduce, to the extent possible, the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ), which consists of certain members of senior management, evaluates the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities, our operating environment and capital and liquidity requirements, and modifies our lending, investing and deposit gathering strategies accordingly. The Board of Directors then reviews the ALCO s activities and strategies, the effect of those strategies on our net interest margin, and the effect that changes in market interest rates would have on the economic value of our loan and securities portfolios as well as the intrinsic value of our deposits and borrowings, and reports to the full Board of Directors. 
  We actively evaluate interest rate risk in connection with our lending, investing and deposit activities. In an effort to better manage interest-rate risk, we have de-emphasized the origination of residential mortgage loans, and have increased our emphasis on the origination of nonresidential real estate loans, multi-family mortgage loans, commercial loans and commercial leases. In addition, depending on market interest rates and our capital and liquidity position, we generally sell all or a portion of our longer-term, fixed-rate residential loans, usually on a servicing-retained basis. Further, we primarily invest in shorter-duration securities, which generally have lower yields compared to longer-term investments. Shortening the average maturity of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term loans and securities, as well as loans with variable rates of interest, helps to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Finally, we have classified all of our investment portfolio as available-for-sale so as to provide flexibility in liquidity management. 
  We utilize a combination of analyses to monitor the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates. The economic value of equity analysis is a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value ( NPV ) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. In calculating changes in NPV, we assume estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates that seem most likely based on historical experience during prior interest rate changes. 
  Our net interest income analysis utilizes the data derived from the dynamic GAP analysis, described below, and applies several additional elements, including actual interest rate indices and margins, contractual limitations such as interest rate floors and caps and the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of the balance sheet date. In addition, we apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred instantaneously. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the dynamic GAP repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. 
  Our dynamic GAP analysis determines the relative balance between the repricing of assets and liabilities over multiple periods of time (ranging from overnight to five years). Dynamic GAP analysis includes expected cash flows from loans and mortgage-backed securities, applying prepayment rates based on the differential between the current interest rate and the market interest rate for each loan and security type. This analysis identifies mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing but does not necessarily provide an accurate indicator of interest rate risk because it omits the factors incorporated into the net interest income analysis.

Quantitative Analysis.   The following table sets forth, as of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated changes in the Bank s NPV and net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. 

The table set forth above indicates that at   September 30, 2016  , in the event of an immediate 25 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Bank would be expected to experience a   0.71%   decrease in NPV and a   $404,000   decrease in net interest income.  In the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Bank would be expected to experience a   1.10%   decrease in NPV and a   $1,240,000   increase in net interest income. This data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could reduce the actual impact on NPV and net interest income, if any. 
  Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV and net interest income requires that we make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The NPV and net interest income table presented above assumes that the composition of our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors. The table also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities. Because of the shortcomings mentioned above, management considers many additional factors such as projected changes in loan and deposit balances and various projected forward interest rate scenarios when evaluating strategies for managing interest rate risk.  Accordingly, although the NPV and net interest income table provides an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate changes at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.
