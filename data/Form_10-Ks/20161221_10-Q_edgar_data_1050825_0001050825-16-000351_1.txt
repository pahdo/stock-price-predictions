  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
           1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions in Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. Results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for a full year. Reference should be made to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 26, 2016   ( Form 10-K ). The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   February 26, 2016   was derived from the audited Consolidated Balance Sheet included in our Form 10-K. 
  As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Report ), unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to  Steelcase,   we,   our,   Company  and similar references are to Steelcase Inc. and its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Unless the context otherwise indicates, reference to a year relates to the fiscal year, ended in February of the year indicated, rather than a calendar year. Additionally, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 reference the first, second, third and fourth quarter, respectively, of the fiscal year indicated. All amounts are in millions, except share and per share data, data presented as a percentage or as otherwise indicated. 
   
           2.   
    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
     In November 2016 and August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU") No. 2016-18 and No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  , which update the guidance as to how restricted cash, certain cash receipts and certain cash payments should be presented and classified.  The updates are intended to reduce diversity in practice.  The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)  .  The update is intended to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  We plan to adopt this accounting guidance in Q1 2018.  The updated guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)  , which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses.  The update is intended to provide financial statement users with more useful information about expected credit losses.  The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning December 15, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  , which is part of the FASB Simplification Initiative.  The updated guidance simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions.  The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which establishes a new lease accounting model for lessees.  The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.  The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)  , which updates the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.  The updated guidance changes the accounting and disclosure of equity investments (except those that are consolidated or accounted for under the equity method).  The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , a new standard on revenue recognition.  The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
   
           3. 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
     Earnings per share is computed using the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Participating securities represent restricted stock units in which the participants have non-forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents during the performance period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effects of certain performance units in which the participants have forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents during the performance period.

    FAIR VALUE 
     The carrying amounts for many of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities, approximate their fair value due to their relatively short maturities.  Our short-term investments, foreign exchange forward contracts and long-term investments are measured at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  Our total debt is carried at cost and was   $297.3   and   $299.1   as of   November 25, 2016   and   February 26, 2016  , respectively. The fair value of our total debt is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for similar types of instruments and was approximately   $332   and   $326   as of   November 25, 2016   and   February 26, 2016  , respectively.  The estimation of the fair value of our total debt is based on Level 2 fair value measurements. 
  We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intention to reduce our risk of short-term volatility. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.

    INVENTORIES 

The portion of inventories determined by the LIFO method was   $78.3   and   $76.3   as of   November 25, 2016   and   February 26, 2016  , respectively. 
   
           7. 
    SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT 
     On September 23, 2016 we entered into a   $125   committed five-year unsecured revolving syndicated credit facility ( New Facility ). The New Facility amends and restates our previous unsecured revolving syndicated credit facility ( Old Facility ) that was scheduled to expire in March 2017. At our option, and subject to certain conditions, we may increase the aggregate commitment under the New Facility by up to   $75   by obtaining at least one commitment from one of the lenders. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the New Facility. 
  We can use borrowings under the New Facility for general corporate purposes, including friendly acquisitions.  Interest on borrowings is based on the rate, as selected by us, between the following two options: 
             
    the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal fund effective rate plus 0.5%, and the Eurocurrency rate for a one month interest period plus 1%, plus the applicable margin as set forth in the credit agreement; or 
                
    the Eurocurrency rate plus the applicable margin as set forth in the credit agreement. 
     The New Facility requires us to satisfy two financial covenants: 
             
    A maximum leverage ratio covenant, which is measured by the ratio of (x) indebtedness (as determined under the credit agreement) less unrestricted cash (as determined under the credit agreement) to (y) trailing four quarter Adjusted EBITDA (as determined under the credit agreement) and is required to be no greater than 3:1. (In the context of certain permitted acquisitions, we have a one-time ability, subject to certain conditions, to increase the maximum ratio to 3.25 to 1.0 for four consecutive quarters.) 
                
    A minimum interest coverage ratio covenant, which is measured by the ratio of (x) trailing four quarter   Adjusted EBITDA (as determined under the credit agreement) to (y) trailing four quarter interest expense and is required to be no less than 3.5:1. 
     The New Facility does not include any restrictions on cash dividend payments or share repurchases.  As of November 25, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the New Facility.

During Q3 2017, French tax authorities concluded an audit of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 tax years.  As a result, we reduced unrecognized tax benefits by   $5.7   and recognized a tax benefit of   $5.7  .   

9. 
    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
     Performance Units 
  In Q1 2017, we awarded   189,800   performance units ("PSUs") to our executive officers. The PSUs awarded are earned after a three-year performance period, from 2017 through 2019, based on achievement of certain total shareholder return results relative to a comparison group of companies, which is a market condition, and, if earned, will be issued in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock. The number of shares that may be earned can range from   0%   to   200%   of the target amount; therefore, the maximum number of shares that can be issued under these awards is   379,600  . These PSUs are expensed and recorded in   Additional paid-in capital   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets over the performance period. We used the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the fair value of these PSUs on the date of grant. The model resulted in a weighted average grant date fair value of   $16.33   per unit for these PSUs, compared to   $24.15   and   $23.25   per unit for similar PSUs granted in 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  The weighted average grant date fair values were determined using the following assumptions:    

  _______________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Based on the U.S. government bond benchmark on the grant date. 
              (2) 
    Represents the historical price volatility of the Company s common stock for the three-year period preceding the grant date. 
     The total PSU expense and associated tax benefit for all outstanding awards for the   three and nine months ended     November 25, 2016   and   November 27, 2015   are as follows: 

As of   November 25, 2016  , there was   $5.3   of remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of   1.5   years.

The PSU activity for the   nine months ended     November 25, 2016   is as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units 
  During the nine months ended   November 25, 2016  , we awarded   975,663   restricted stock units ("RSUs"), of which   168,200   were awarded to our executive officers. These RSUs have restrictions on transfer which lapse three years after the date of grant, at which time the units will be issued as unrestricted shares of Class A Common Stock. RSUs are expensed and recorded in   Additional paid-in capital   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets over the requisite service period based on the value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. 
  The RSU expense and associated tax benefit for all outstanding awards for the   three and nine months ended     November 25, 2016   and   November 27, 2015   are as follows: 

As of   November 25, 2016  , there was   $11.3   of remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.9   years. 
  The RSU activity for the   nine months ended     November 25, 2016   is as follows: 

10. 
    REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
     Our reportable segments consist of the Americas segment, the EMEA segment and the Other category. Unallocated corporate costs are reported as Corporate.

  Revenue and operating income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     November 25, 2016   and   November 27, 2015   and total assets as of   November 25, 2016   and   February 26, 2016   by segment are presented below: 

11. 
    RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES 
     In Q1 2016, we announced restructuring actions in EMEA related to the establishment of a Learning + Innovation Center in Munich, Germany.  In Q2 2016, we completed negotiations with the works councils related to these actions.  We expect to incur approximately   $10   of restructuring costs in connection with this project, including approximately   $7   of employee separation costs and approximately   $3   of costs associated with employee and equipment moves, retention compensation and consulting costs.  We recognized   $0.2   of benefits related to favorable adjustments to employee separation costs and incurred   $0.3   of employee separation costs in the EMEA segment in connection with these actions during the three and nine months ended   November 25, 2016  , respectively.  We also incurred   $0.2   of business exit and other related costs in the EMEA segment in connection with these actions during the nine months ended   November 25, 2016  .  We incurred   $6.7   of employee separation costs and   $1.9   of business exit and other related costs in the EMEA segment in connection with these actions during 2016. 
  In Q1 2015, we announced restructuring actions in the Americas to close a manufacturing facility in High Point, North Carolina.  In connection with these actions, we incurred a total of   $4.2   of business exit and other related costs in the Americas segment, including   $2.6   during the nine months ended   November 25, 2016  .  We also incurred   $3.1   of employee termination costs in the Americas segment, all of which were recorded prior to 2017.  These restructuring actions are complete.

In Q3 2014, we announced restructuring actions in EMEA to close a manufacturing facility in Durlangen, Germany, and to establish a new manufacturing location in Stribro, Czech Republic.  In connection with this project, we incurred a total of   $8.8   related to business exit and other related costs in the EMEA segment, including   $1.6     during the nine months ended   November 25, 2016  .  We also incurred   $17.5   of employee termination costs, all of which were recorded prior to 2017.  These restructuring actions are complete. 
  Restructuring costs (benefits) are summarized in the following table:

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: 
     This management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 26, 2016  . Reference to a year relates to the fiscal year, ended in February of the year indicated, rather than the calendar year, unless indicated by a specific date. Additionally, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 reference the first, second, third and fourth quarter, respectively, of the fiscal year indicated. All amounts are in millions, except share and per share data, data presented as a percentage or as otherwise indicated. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  This item contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A  non-GAAP financial measure  is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the condensed consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we have provided a reconciliation below of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
  The non-GAAP financial measures used are: (1) organic revenue growth (decline), which represents the change in revenue excluding estimated currency translation effects and the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, and (2) adjusted operating income (loss), which represents operating income (loss) excluding restructuring costs (benefits). These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends. Therefore, management believes this information is also useful for investors.

Overview 
  In Q3 2017, revenue was relatively flat compared to the prior year, with the Americas and EMEA each posting modest organic revenue growth and the Other category posting a modest organic revenue decline.  Our revenue growth in the Americas exceeded the industry for the first two months of the quarter, based on the most current information available from our industry association.  Our new product introductions and other strategic actions taken in the current year contributed to growth in our day-to-day business and continued strengthening of our internal estimates of project orders expected to ship in the next four quarters compared to the prior year. 
  Our operating performance in the quarter reflected a decline in the Americas which was largely offset by a significant improvement in EMEA which achieved adjusted operating income compared to an adjusted operating loss in the prior year.  The decline in the Americas was driven by unfavorable shifts in business mix and higher operating expenses.  It was the first time in four years that EMEA posted adjusted operating income and the year-over-year improvement of $15 was driven by a 1,050 basis point reduction in cost of sales as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year.  EMEA posted modest organic revenue growth in the quarter driven by the timing of customer deliveries, while orders and backlog declined during the quarter. 
  Q3 2017 Compared to Q3 2016 
  We recorded net income of   $41.2   and diluted earnings per share of   $0.34   in   Q3 2017   compared to net income of   $35.6   and diluted earnings per share of   $0.28   in   Q3 2016  .  Operating income of   $54.6   in   Q3 2017   compared to operating income of   $55.2   in   Q3 2016  .  Higher operating expenses in the Americas were partially offset by reductions in cost of sales as a percent of revenue in EMEA and lower restructuring costs.  After adjusting for the impact of restructuring costs, adjusted operating income of   $54.4   in   Q3 2017   represented a decrease of   $3.8   (or 50 basis points as a percent of revenue) compared to   Q3 2016  .

Revenue in   Q3 2017   was relatively flat compared to the prior year, with the Americas posting minimal growth offset by small declines in EMEA and the Other category.  After adjusting for   $3.8   of unfavorable currency translation effects, organic revenue growth was   $2.7   or less than 1%.  On an organic basis, revenue in the Americas was consistent with the prior year, while revenue in EMEA grew by   2%   and revenue in the Other category declined by   2%  . 
  Cost of sales decreased by   80   basis points to   66.7%   of revenue in   Q3 2017   compared to   Q3 2016  .  The improvement was due to a significant decrease in EMEA, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase in the Americas.  The improvement in EMEA was driven by the elimination of disruption costs and inefficiencies associated with operational footprint changes and other manufacturing and distribution issues experienced in the prior year, as well as benefits from cost reduction efforts, gross margin improvement initiatives and favorable shifts in business mix.  The increase in the Americas was primarily driven by unfavorable shifts in business mix. 
  Operating expenses of   $207.5   in   Q3 2017   represented an increase of   $9.7   or   130   basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year.  The increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense (including expense associated with a tax benefit recorded in the quarter) and higher sales, product development and marketing costs. 
  We recorded restructuring benefits of   $0.2   in   Q3 2017   compared to restructuring costs of   $3.0   in   Q3 2016  .  The   Q3 2017   benefits represented favorable adjustments to employee separation costs relating to the establishment of the Learning + Innovation Center in Munich.  The   Q3 2016   costs primarily related to the establishment of the Learning + Innovation Center in Munich and the closure of a manufacturing facility in Durlangen, Germany.  See Note   11   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Our effective tax rate in   Q3 2017   was   24.8%   compared to a   Q3 2016   effective tax rate of   34.9%  .  The improvement was primarily due to a benefit related to the outcome of a tax audit in EMEA.  See Note   8   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Year-to-Date 2017 Compared to Year-to-Date 2016 
  We recorded   year-to-date 2017   net income of   $98.8   compared to   year-to-date 2016   net income of   $92.8  .    Year-to-date 2017   operating income increased by   $1.0   to   $149.8   compared to the prior year.  The slight improvement was driven by a reduction in cost of sales as a percent of revenue in EMEA and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by higher operating expenses in the Americas.  After adjusting for the impact of restructuring costs, adjusted operating income of   $154.5   in   year-to-date 2017   represented a decrease of   $10.5   (or 30 basis points as a percent of revenue) compared to prior year. 
  Year-to-date 2017   revenue of   $2,263.3   represented a decrease of   $48.8   compared to the prior year.  The decrease in revenue was driven by lower revenue in the Americas and EMEA.  After adjusting for a   $6.8   favorable impact of an acquisition in the Americas and   $7.9   of unfavorable currency translation effects, the organic revenue decline was   $47.7   or   2%  .  On an organic basis, revenue declined by   3%   in the Americas and   2%   in EMEA which was partially offset by revenue growth of   3%   in the Other category. 
  Cost of sales decreased by   120   basis points to   66.5%   of revenue in   year-to-date 2017   compared to   year-to-date 2016  .  The improvement was due to a   770   basis point improvement in EMEA, while cost of sales in the Americas and the Other category was generally consistent with the prior year.  The improvement in EMEA was driven by the same factors as the quarter. 
  Operating expenses of   $604.5   in   year-to-date 2017   represented an increase of   $21.9   or   150   basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year.  Operating expenses increased by   $16.0   in the Americas,   $2.8   in EMEA and   $2.6   in the Other category.  The increase in the Americas was driven by higher sales, product development and marketing costs.  The increase in EMEA was driven by costs associated with the new Learning + Innovation center in Munich. 
  We recorded   year-to-date 2017   net restructuring costs of   $4.7   compared to net restructuring costs of   $16.2   in   year-to-date 2016  .  The   year-to-date 2017   amount included costs related to the closure of the manufacturing facility in High Point, North Carolina, the closure of the manufacturing facility in Durlangen and the establishment of the Learning + Innovation Center in Munich.  The   year-to-date 2016   amount included costs associated with those three projects as well as the exit of a manufacturing facility in Wisches, France, partially offset by a $2.8 gain related to the sale of a facility in the Americas.  See Note   11   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

The decline in the quarter was primarily driven by unfavorable shifts in business mix and higher variable compensation expense.  On a year-to-date basis, the decline was driven by lower sales volume and higher sales and marketing costs.  After adjusting for the impact of restructuring costs, adjusted operating income decreased by   $15.4   in   Q3 2017   and   $32.7   in   year-to-date 2017   compared to the prior year.

Geographic regions     The Northeast and East Business Groups grew year over year while the South and West Business Groups declined. 

Contract type     Continuing business grew, while marketing programs and project business declined year over year. 
     Year-to-date 2017   revenue of   $1,668.1   represented a decrease of   $42.6   compared to   year-to-date 2016  , and the decrease was driven by lower volume.  After adjusting for   $2.3   of unfavorable currency translation effects and a   $6.8   favorable impact of an acquisition, the   year-to-date 2017   organic revenue decline was   $47.1   or   3%   compared to the prior year. 
  Cost of sales in the Americas increased by   140   basis points to   66.1%   of revenue in   Q3 2017   compared to   64.7%   of revenue in   Q3 2016  .  The increase was driven primarily by unfavorable shifts in business mix.    Year-to-date 2017   cost of sales was   65.0%   of revenue which is consistent with the prior year. 
  Operating expenses increased by   $7.7  , or   120   basis points as a percent of revenue, in   Q3 2017   compared to the prior year primarily due to $5.5 of higher variable compensation expense and $2.2 of higher sales, product development and marketing costs including dealer conferences.  Operating expenses increased by   $16.0  , or   150   basis points as a percent of revenue, in   year-to-date 2017   compared to the prior year driven by $9.2 of higher sales, product development and marketing costs and higher corporate costs. 
  There were no restructuring costs recorded in the Americas in   Q3 2017   compared to restructuring costs of   $0.7   in   Q3 2016   associated with the closure of the manufacturing facility in High Point which was completed in Q1 2017.    Year-to-date 2017   restructuring costs of   $2.6   associated with the High Point closure compared to net restructuring benefits of   $0.7   in   year-to-date 2016   which included a $2.8 gain related to the sale of a facility, partially offset by costs associated with the High Point closure.  See Note   11   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Operating results in EMEA improved significantly in   Q3 2017   and   year-to-date 2017   compared to the prior year.  The improvement in   Q3 2017   and   year-to-date 2017   was due to a significant decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenue and lower restructuring costs compared to the prior year.  The year-to-date improvement was partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume. 
  EMEA revenue represented   17.2%   of consolidated revenue in   Q3 2017  .  Revenue for   Q3 2017   was   $135.5   compared to   $136.2   in   Q3 2016  .  After adjusting for   $3.4   of unfavorable currency translation effects, the organic revenue growth was   $2.7   or   2%  .  For   year-to-date 2017  , revenue declined by   $10.6   or   3%   compared to the prior year due to volume declines in the United Kingdom, Middle East and Africa, partially offset by revenue growth in France.  
  Cost of sales as a percent of revenue decreased significantly in Q3 2017 and year-to-date 2017 compared to the prior year, driven by the elimination of disruption costs and inefficiencies associated with operational footprint changes and other manufacturing and distribution issues experienced in the prior year.  We incurred zero and approximately $3 of costs relating to these issues in Q3 2017 and year-to-date 2017, respectively, compared to approximately $9 and $23 in Q3 2016 and year-to-date 2016, respectively.  Q3 2017 and year-to-date 2017 also benefited from cost reduction efforts, gross margin improvement initiatives and favorable shifts in business mix. 
  Operating expenses in   Q3 2017   declined slightly compared to the prior year.  Operating expenses increased by   $2.8   in   year-to-date 2017   compared to the prior year and reflected higher costs associated with our new Learning + Innovation Center in Munich. 
  Restructuring benefits of   $0.2   in   Q3 2017   represented favorable adjustments to employee separation costs relating to the establishment of the Learning + Innovation Center in Munich.  Restructuring costs of   $2.1   in   year-to-date 2017   were related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in Durlangen which was completed in Q1 2017 and the establishment of the Learning + Innovation Center in Munich.  Restructuring costs of   $2.3   and   $16.9   in   Q3 2016   and   year-to-date 2016  , respectively, were primarily related to the same two projects.  See Note   11   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Other 
  The Other category includes Asia Pacific, Designtex and PolyVision. Asia Pacific serves customers in Asia and Australia primarily under the Steelcase brand with an emphasis on freestanding furniture systems, storage and seating solutions. Designtex designs and sells surface materials including textiles and wall coverings which are specified by architects and designers directly to end-use customers primarily in North America. PolyVision manufactures ceramic steel surfaces for use in multiple applications, but primarily for sale to third-party fabricators and distributors to create static whiteboards and chalkboards sold in the primary and secondary education markets globally.

     Table of Contents  

Operating results in the Other category declined slightly in   Q3 2017   and   year-to-date 2017   compared to the prior year.  The   Q3 2017   results reflect lower operating income in Asia Pacific driven by lower volume compared to a strong prior year and higher operating expenses.  On a year-to-date basis, lower income at PolyVision was partially offset by improvements in Asia Pacific and Designtex. 
  Revenue in the Other category represented   9.5%   of consolidated revenue in   Q3 2017  .  Revenue in   Q3 2017   decreased   $1.6   or   2%   compared to the prior year driven by lower volume in Asia Pacific and PolyVision, partially offset by growth at Designtex.    Year-to-date 2017   revenue of   $221.6   represented an increase of   $4.4   or   2%   compared to the prior year.  The increase was driven by strong growth in Asia Pacific and Designtex partially offset by lower volume at PolyVision. 
   
  Corporate 
  Corporate costs include unallocated portions of shared service functions, such as information technology, corporate facilities, finance, human resources, research, legal and executive, plus deferred compensation expense and income or losses associated with COLI. 

The increase in operating expenses in Q3 2017 was primarily due to lower COLI income, while the increase in operating expenses in year-to-date 2017 was primarily due to higher deferred compensation expense, partially offset by higher COLI income. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Based on current business conditions, we target a minimum of $75 to $150 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund day-to-day operations, including seasonal disbursements, particularly the annual payment of accrued variable compensation and retirement plan contributions in Q1 of each fiscal year.  In addition, we may carry additional liquidity for potential investments in strategic initiatives and as a cushion against economic volatility. 

As of   November 25, 2016  , we held a total of   $235.8   in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  The majority of our short-term investments are located in the U.S. Of our total   $139.1   in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 54% was located in the U.S. and the remaining 46% was located outside of the U.S., primarily in France, Mexico, Hong Kong and China.  The amounts located outside the U.S. would be taxable if repatriated to the U.S. as dividends.  Such amounts are considered available to repay intercompany debt, available to meet local working capital requirements or permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. 
  The majority of our short-term investments are maintained in a managed investment portfolio, which primarily consists of corporate debt securities and U.S. agency debt securities.

Our investments in COLI policies are intended to be utilized as a long-term funding source for long-term employee benefit obligations.  However, COLI can be used as a source of liquidity if needed.  We believe the financial strength of the issuing insurance companies associated with our COLI policies is sufficient to meet their obligations.  COLI investments are recorded at their net cash surrender value. 
  Availability under credit facilities may be reduced related to compliance with applicable covenants.  See Note   7   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     November 25, 2016   and   November 27, 2015  : 

Cash provided by operating activities 

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in year-to-date 2017 compared to year-to-date 2016 was partially driven by higher variable compensation payments compared to the prior year. In addition, year-to-date 2016 included proceeds from the settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts.  Year-to-date 2017 also reflected a reduction in VAT recoverable. 
  Cash used in investing activities

     Table of Contents  

Capital expenditures in year-to-date 2017 included investments in our global manufacturing operations, product development and the new Learning + Innovation Center in Munich.  In addition, a $3 payment was made in year-to-date 2017 in connection with the delivery of a new aircraft compared to $26 of progress payments in year-to-date 2016.  
  Liquidations of short-term investments were higher in year-to-date 2017 in order to fund higher variable compensation payments and other liquidity needs. 
  Cash used in financing activities 

We paid dividends of $0.12 per common share in each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $0.1125 per share in each of the first three quarters of 2016. 
  In year-to-date 2017, we made common stock repurchases of 3,506,661 shares, 506,661 of which were made to satisfy participants' tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of equity awards, pursuant to the terms of the Incentive Compensation Plan.  As of the end of   Q3 2017  , we had   $126.5   of remaining availability under the $150 share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in Q4 2016. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  During   Q3 2017  , no material change in our off-balance sheet arrangements occurred. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  During   Q3 2017  , no material change in our contractual obligations occurred. 
  Liquidity Facilities 
  Our total liquidity facilities as of   November 25, 2016   were: 

On September 23, 2016 we entered into a $125 million committed five-year unsecured revolving syndicated credit facility ( New Facility ).  The New Facility amends and restates our previous unsecured syndicated credit facility that was scheduled to expire in March 2017.  See further details on the New Facility in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  The various uncommitted lines may be changed or canceled by the banks at any time.  There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted facilities as of November 25, 2016. 
  In addition, we have credit agreements of   $37.6   which can be utilized to support letters of credit, bank guarantees or foreign exchange contracts; letters of credit and bank guarantees of   $13.1   were outstanding under such facilities as of   November 25, 2016  .  There were no draws on our standby letters of credit during   Q3 2017  . 
  Total consolidated debt as of   November 25, 2016   was   $297.3  .  Our debt primarily consists of $248.1 in term notes due in 2021 with an effective interest rate of 6.6%.  In addition, we have a term loan with a balance as of  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

November 25, 2016   of $48.7.  This term loan has a floating interest rate based on 30-day LIBOR plus 1.20% and is due in Q1 2024.  The term notes are unsecured and the term loan is secured by two aircraft.  The term notes and the term loan do not contain financial covenants and are not cross-defaulted to our other debt facilities. 
  Liquidity Outlook 
  Our current cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, funds available under our credit facilities, funds available from COLI and cash generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity needs.  We continue to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity and maintain flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures and discretionary operating expenses. 
  Our significant uses of funds include non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, variable compensation and retirement plan contributions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt service obligations. 
  We currently expect capital expenditures to approximate $60 to $70 in 2017 compared to $93 in 2016.  This estimate includes investments in our global manufacturing operations, product development and the new Learning + Innovation Center in Munich.  We closely manage capital spending to ensure we are making investments that we believe will sustain our business and preserve our ability to introduce innovative new products.  
  On December 20, 2016, we announced a quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.12 per share, or approximately $14.4, to be paid in Q4 2017.  Future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds: 
     Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  The following is a summary of share repurchase activity during   Q3 2017  : 

_______________________________________ 
           (1) 
    In January 2016, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program permitting the repurchase of up to $150 of shares of our common stock.  This program has no specific expiration date.  On October 10, 2016, we entered into a stock repurchase agreement with a third party broker under which the broker is authorized to repurchase up to 5 million shares of our common stock on our behalf during the period from October 11, 2016 through March 23, 2017, subject to certain price, market and volume constraints specified in the agreement.  A similar agreement with a broker expired on September 23, 2016, under which the broker was authorized to repurchase up to 4 million shares of our common stock.
