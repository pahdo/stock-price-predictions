Note 1.        Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Government Properties Income Trust and its subsidiaries, or GOV, we, us or our, are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted.  We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or our Annual Report.  In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.  All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.  Our operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. Reclassifications have been made to the prior years  condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation. 
    
  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant estimates in the condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets, impairment of real estate and equity method investments and the valuation of intangible assets. 

Note 2.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2015-02,   Consolidation  . Among other things, this update changes how an entity determines the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The implementation of this update did not have an impact in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability, and FASB ASU No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  , which addresses the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements. The implementation of these updates resulted in the reclassification of certain of our capitalized debt issuance costs as an offset to the associated debt liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The classification of capitalized debt issuance costs related to our unsecured revolving credit facility remains unchanged in accordance with ASU No. 2015-15. As of   December 31, 2015  , debt issuance costs related to our unsecured term loans, senior unsecured notes and mortgage notes payable of   $3,510  ,   $2,172   and   $344  , respectively, were reclassified from assets to the associated debt liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The implementation of this update did not have an impact in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which changes how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted subject to certain conditions. Currently, changes in fair value of these investments are recorded through other comprehensive income. Under this ASU, these changes will be recorded through earnings. We are continuing to evaluate this guidance, but we expect the implementation of this guidance will affect how changes in the fair value of available for sale equity investments we hold are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  , which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). ASU No. 2016-02

requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right of use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which requires that entities use a new forward looking  expected loss  model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3.        Weighted Average Common Shares 
    
  The following table provides a reconciliation of the weighted average number of common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands):  

Note 4.   Real Estate Properties 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   71   properties (  91   buildings), with an undepreciated carrying value of   $1,788,001  , excluding   one   property (  one   building) classified as discontinued operations with an undepreciated carrying value of   $12,260  . We generally lease space at our properties on a gross lease or modified gross lease basis pursuant to fixed term contracts expiring between 2016 and 2032.  Our leases generally require us to pay all or some property operating expenses and to provide all or most property management services.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into   17   leases for   136,466   rentable square feet, for a weighted (by rentable square feet) average lease term of   6.8 years   and we made commitments for approximately   $3,428   of leasing related costs. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into   51   leases for   1,226,068   rentable square feet, including a   25,579   square foot expansion to be constructed at an existing property, for a weighted (by rentable square feet) average lease term of   10.3 years   and we made commitments for approximately   $35,033   of leasing related costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have estimated unspent leasing related

obligations of   $21,580   and have committed to redevelop and expand an existing property at an estimated cost to complete of approximately   $17,990  . 
    
  Acquisition Activities 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired an office property (  one   building) located in Sacramento, CA with   337,811   rentable square feet.  This property was   86%   leased, of which   71%   was leased to the State of California and occupied by   three   separate agencies, on the date of acquisition.  The purchase price was   $79,235  , excluding acquisition costs.  Our allocation of the purchase price of this acquisition based on the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is presented in the table below.  

In July 2016, we acquired certain land we leased from a third party at one of our properties in Atlanta, GA for   $1,623  , excluding acquisition costs. 
    
  Also in July 2016, we entered an agreement to acquire an office property (  one   building) located in Manassas, VA with   69,374   rentable square feet for a purchase price of   $13,200  , excluding acquisition costs.  This property is   100%   leased to Prince William County.  
    
  In August 2016, we entered an agreement to acquire transferable development rights that would allow us to expand a property we own in Washington, D.C. for a purchase price of   $2,030  , excluding acquisition costs. 
    
  Our pending acquisitions are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete these acquisitions or that these acquisitions will not be delayed or the terms of these acquisitions will not change. 
    
  We regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate an impairment in the value of our long lived assets. If there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized. We determine the amount of any impairment loss by comparing the historical carrying value to estimated fair value. We estimate fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance and projected discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques. In addition to consideration of impairment upon the events or changes in circumstances described above, we regularly evaluate the remaining lives of our long lived assets. If we change our estimate of the remaining lives, we allocate the carrying value of the affected assets over their revised remaining lives. 
    
  Disposition Activities   Continuing Operations 
    
  In July 2016, we sold an office property (  one   1   building     ) in Savannah, GA with   35,228   rentable square feet that had a net book value of   $2,986   for   $4,000  , excluding closing costs. In connection with this sale, we provided   $3,600   of mortgage financing to the buyer. The mortgage note requires interest to be paid at an annual rate of LIBOR plus   4.0%  , subject to a minimum annual interest rate of   5.0%  , and requires monthly payments of interest only until maturity on June 30, 2021. This sales transaction did not qualify for full gain recognition under GAAP and is being accounted for under the installment method. Accordingly, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of   $79   during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and recorded a deferred gain of   $712  , which we currently expect to recognize when the mortgage note is repaid.  The mortgage note receivable of   $3,600  , net of the   $712   deferred gain, is included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  
    
  We classified this property as held for sale as of June 30, 2016. The results of operations for this property were included in continuing operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements up to the date of sale.  Summarized balance sheet information for the property as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:

Disposition Activities   Discontinued Operations 
    
  In March 2016, we entered an agreement to sell an office property (  one   building) in Falls Church, VA with   164,746   rentable square feet and a net book value of   $12,282   at   September 30, 2016  .  The contract sales price is   $13,000  , excluding closing costs.  This sale is subject to conditions, including the purchaser obtaining certain zoning entitlements, and is currently expected to occur in the first quarter of 2017.  We cannot be sure that the sale of this property will occur, that the sale will not be delayed or that its terms will not change. We have classified this property, which was held for sale prior to our adoption of FASB ASU No. 2014-08,   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,   as a discontinued operation in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Summarized balance sheet and income statement information for the property is as follows: 
    
  Balance Sheets    

Statements of Operations 

Note 5.   Revenue Recognition 
    
  We recognize rental income from operating leases that contain fixed contractual rent changes on a straight line basis over the term of the lease agreements.  Certain of our leases with government tenants provide the tenant the right to terminate before the lease expiration date if the legislature or other funding authority does not appropriate the funding necessary for the government tenant to meet its lease obligations; we have determined the fixed non-cancelable lease term of these leases to be the fully executed term of the lease because we believe the occurrence of early terminations to be remote contingencies based on both our historical experience and our assessments of the likelihood of lease cancellation on a separate lease basis. 
    
  We increased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by   $1,205   and   $613   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1,789   and   $2,820   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,

respectively.  Rents receivable include   $20,784   and   $18,995   of straight line rent receivables at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 6.   Concentration 
    
  Tenant and Credit Concentration 
    
  We define annualized rental income as the annualized contractual base rents from our tenants pursuant to our lease agreements as of the measurement date, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated recurring expense reimbursements to be paid to us, and excluding lease value amortization. The U.S. Government,   13   state governments, and   three   other government tenants combined were responsible for approximately   92.4%   and   92.8%   of our annualized rental income, excluding   one   property (  one   building) classified as discontinued operations, as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The U.S. Government is our largest tenant by annualized rental income and was responsible for approximately   63.9%   and   67.5%   of our annualized rental income, excluding one property classified as discontinued operations, as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Geographic Concentration 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our   71   properties (  91   buildings), excluding   one   property (  one   building) classified as discontinued operations, were located in   31   states and the District of Columbia.  Properties located in California, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Georgia, New York, Maryland and Massachusetts were responsible for approximately   14.6%  ,   10.0%  ,   9.9%  ,   9.2%  ,   8.1%  ,   7.6%   and   5.3%   of our annualized rental income as of   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

Note 7.   Indebtedness 
    
  Our principal debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   were: (1)   $25,000   of outstanding borrowings under our   $750,000   unsecured revolving credit facility; (2)   $550,000   aggregate outstanding principal amount of term loans; (3) an aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $660,000   of public issuances of senior unsecured notes; and (4)   $27,877   aggregate principal amount of mortgage notes.  
    
  Our   $750,000   unsecured revolving credit facility is available for general business purposes, including acquisitions. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is January 31, 2019 and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of our revolving credit facility by   one   year to January 31, 2020.  We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity and   no   principal repayment is due until maturity. We are required to pay interest at a rate of   LIBOR   plus a premium, which was 125 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  , on borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  We also pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, which was 25 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  .

term loan.  The interest rate premium is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings.

The weighted average annual interest rate under our   $250,000   term loan was   2.3%   for both the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2.0%   for both the three and   nine   months ended September 30,   2015  . 
    
  Our   $750,000   revolving credit facility, our   $300,000   term loan and our   $250,000   term loan are governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders that includes a number of features common to all of these credit arrangements. This credit agreement also includes a feature under which the maximum aggregate borrowing availability may be increased to up to   $2,500,000   on a combined basis in certain circumstances. 
    
  In May 2016, we issued   $300,000   of   5.875%   senior unsecured notes due 2046 in an underwritten public offering. In June 2016, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase an additional   $10,000   of these notes. The net proceeds from this offering of   $299,771  , after offering expenses, were used to repay all amounts then outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes. These notes require quarterly payments of interest only through maturity and may be repaid at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest) on or after May 26, 2021. Our   $350,000   of   3.75%   senior unsecured notes due 2019 require semi-annual payments of interest only through maturity and may be repaid at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest) on or after July 15, 2019 or before that date together with a make whole premium. Both issuances of our senior notes are governed by an indenture and its supplements. 
    
  Our credit agreement and senior notes indenture and its supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC, ceasing to act as our business manager and property manager.  Our credit agreement and our senior notes indenture and its supplements also contain a number of covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, require us to maintain certain financial ratios and, in the case of our credit agreement, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances.  We believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of the respective covenants under our credit agreement and senior notes indenture and its supplements at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In February 2016, we repaid, at par, a   $23,473   mortgage note requiring annual interest of   6.21%   which was secured by   one   office property (  one   building) located in Landover, MD. This mortgage note was scheduled to mature in August 2016.  We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $21   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represented unamortized debt issuance costs related to this note. 
    
  In March 2016, we repaid, at par, an   $83,000   mortgage note requiring annual interest of   5.55%   which was secured by   one   office property (  two   buildings) located in Reston, VA.  This mortgage note was scheduled to mature in April 2016.  We recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $125   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which represented the net unamortized debt premium and debt issuance costs related to this note. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   three   of our properties (  three   buildings) with an aggregate net book value of   $53,150   are encumbered by   three   mortgages for an aggregate principal amount of   $27,877  . Our mortgage notes are non-recourse, subject to certain limited exceptions and do not contain any material financial covenants.

    Our   1,214,225   shares of class A common stock of The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., which are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are reported at fair value which is based on quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs).  Our historical cost basis for these shares is   $26,888   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The net unrealized gain of   $19,180   for these shares as of   September 30, 2016   is included in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
              (2) 
    We estimated the fair value of this property at   September 30, 2016   based upon broker estimates of value less estimated sale costs (Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). 
          
  In addition to the assets described in the table above, our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rents receivable, mortgage note receivable, accounts payable, a revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, mortgage notes payable, amounts due to related persons, other accrued expenses and security deposits.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of our financial instruments approximated their carrying values in our condensed consolidated financial statements due to their short term nature or variable interest rates, except as follows: 

(1) 
    Carrying amount includes certain unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized premiums and discounts. 
              (2) 
    We assumed these mortgages in connection with our acquisitions of the encumbered properties.  The stated interest rates for these mortgage debts are the contractually stated rates.  We recorded the assumed mortgages at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and we are amortizing the fair value premiums, if any, to interest expense over the respective terms of the mortgages to reduce interest expense to the estimated market interest rates as of the date of acquisition. 
         
  We estimate the fair value of our senior unsecured notes using an average of the bid and ask price of the notes as of the measurement date (Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). We estimate the fair values of our mortgage notes payable by using discounted cash flow analyses and currently prevailing market terms as of the measurement date (Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP).  Because Level 3 inputs are unobservable, our estimated fair value may differ materially from the actual fair value.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   24,918,421  , or approximately   27.9%  , of the then outstanding SIR common shares.  SIR is a real estate investment trust that is primarily focused on owning and investing in net leased, single tenant properties.

($283)   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10,248   and   ($75)   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our investment in SIR had a carrying value of   $491,973   and a market value, based on the closing price of SIR common shares on the Nasdaq on   September 30, 2016  , of   $670,306  . We periodically evaluate our equity investment in SIR for possible indicators of other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable.  These indicators may include the length of time the market value of our investment is below our cost basis, the financial condition of SIR, our intent and ability to be a long term holder of the investment and other considerations.  If the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, we may record an impairment charge to adjust the basis of the investment to its fair value. 
    
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , SIR issued   53,400   and   65,900   common shares, respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , SIR issued   45,389   and   29,414,279   common shares, respectively.  We recognized a gain (loss) on issuance of shares by SIR of   $72   and   ($21)   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and a gain (loss) of   $88   and   ($42,145)   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as a result of the per share issuance price of these SIR common shares being above (below) the then average per share carrying value of our SIR common shares. 
    
  The cost of our investments in SIR exceeded our proportionate share of SIR s total shareholders  equity book value on their dates of acquisition by an aggregate of   $166,272  . As required under GAAP, we were amortizing this difference to equity in earnings of investees over the average remaining useful lives of the real estate assets and intangible assets and liabilities owned by SIR as of the respective dates of our acquisitions.  This amortization decreased our equity in the earnings of SIR by   zero   and   $4,742   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  We recorded a loss on impairment of our SIR investment during the three months ended June 30, 2015 resulting in the carrying value of our SIR investment being less than our proportionate share of SIR s total shareholders  equity book value as of June 30, 2015.  As a result, the previous basis difference was eliminated and we are currently accreting a basis difference of   ($95,089)   to earnings over the estimated remaining useful lives of the real estate assets and intangible assets and liabilities owned by SIR as of June 30, 2015.  This accretion increased our equity in the earnings of SIR by   $740   and   $2,219   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and by   $1,893   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  We received cash distributions from SIR totaling   $12,708   and   $12,459   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $37,627   and   $34,571   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following are summarized financial data of SIR as reported in SIR s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , or the SIR Quarterly Report. References in our financial statements to the SIR Quarterly Report are included as references to the source of the data only, and the information in the SIR Quarterly Report is not incorporated by reference into our financial statements.

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or our Annual Report. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, organized under Maryland law. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   71   properties (  91   buildings), excluding one property (  one   building) classified as discontinued operations.  Our properties are located in   31   states and the District of Columbia and contain approximately   11   million rentable square feet, of which   61.1%   was leased to the U.S. Government,   22.3%   was leased to   13   state governments,   2.8%   was leased to three other government tenants,   8.8%   was leased to various non-governmental organizations and   5.0%   was available for lease as of   September 30, 2016  . The U.S. Government,   13   state governments and   three   other government tenants combined were responsible for   92.4%   and   92.8%   of our annualized rental income as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The term annualized rental income as used in this section is defined as the annualized contractual base rents from our tenants pursuant to our lease agreements as of the measurement date, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated recurring expense reimbursements to be paid to us, and excluding lease value amortization. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we also owned   24,918,421   common shares, or approximately   27.9%   of the then outstanding common shares, of Select Income REIT, or SIR. SIR is a REIT that is primarily focused on owning and investing in net leased, single tenant properties.  See Notes 10 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding our investment in SIR. We account for our investment in SIR under the equity method. 
    
  Property Operations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , excluding one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations,   95.0%   of our rentable square feet was leased, compared to   93.5%   of our rentable square feet as of   September 30, 2015  .  Occupancy data for our properties as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows (square feet in thousands): 

(1) 
    Based on properties we owned on   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and excludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations. 
              (2) 
    Based on properties we owned on   September 30, 2016   and which we owned continuously since January 1, 2015, and excludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations.  Our comparable properties increased from 67 properties (86 buildings) at   September 30, 2015   as a result of our acquisition of four properties (five buildings) during the year ended   December 31, 2014  , offset by the sale of one property (one building) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (3) 
    Subject to changes when space is re-measured or re-configured for tenants. 
              (4) 
    Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for tenant occupancy pursuant to our lease agreements, if any, and (ii) space which is leased, but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any, as of the measurement date. 
       
  The average annualized effective rental rate per square foot for our properties for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

21 

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    Average annualized effective rental rate per square foot represents annualized total rental income during the period specified divided by the average rentable square feet leased during the period specified. Excludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations. 
              (2) 
    Based on properties we owned on   September 30, 2016   and excludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations. 
              (3) 
    Based on properties we owned on   September 30, 2016   and which we owned continuously since July 1, 2015 and January 1, 2015, respectively, and excludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations. 
       
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , changes in rentable square feet leased and available for lease at our properties, excluding one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations, were as follows: 

(1) 
    Based on leases entered into during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Rentable square footage of new leases for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   excludes a   25,579   square foot expansion to be constructed at an existing property prior to the commencement of the lease. 
              (3) 
    Rentable square footage is subject to changes when space is re-measured or re-configured for tenants. 
       
  Leases at our properties totaling   82,030   and   1,204,575   rentable square feet expired during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered into leases totaling   136,466   and   1,226,068   rentable square feet, including a   25,579   square foot expansion to be constructed at an existing property, and lease renewals of   75,895   and   1,017,982   rentable square feet, respectively.  The weighted (by rentable square feet) average rental rates for leases of   62,552   and   1,038,052   rentable square feet entered into with government tenants (which includes the   25,579   square foot expansion referenced above) during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by   10.5%   and   9.6%  , respectively, when compared to the weighted (by rentable square feet) average prior rents for the same space. The weighted (by rentable square feet) average rental rates for leases of   73,914   and   188,016   rentable square feet entered into with non-government tenants during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by   3.8%   and   2.0%  , respectively, when compared to the weighted (by rentable square feet) average rental rates previously charged for the same space. 
    
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , changes in effective rental rates per square foot achieved for new leases and lease renewals that commenced during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to prior effective rental rates per square foot in effect for the same space (and excluding space acquired vacant), were as follows:  

(1) 
    Effective rental rate includes contractual base rents from our tenants pursuant to our lease agreements, plus straight line rent adjustments and estimated expense reimbursements to be paid to us, and excluding lease value amortization.

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , commitments made for expenditures, such as tenant improvements and leasing costs, in connection with leasing space at our properties were as follows: 

(1) 
    Includes commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, tenant reimbursements and free rent. 
              (2) 
    Rentable square footage includes a   25,579   square foot expansion to be constructed at an existing property prior to the commencement of the lease. 
              (3) 
    Excludes the estimated cost to complete of   $17,990   to redevelop and expand an existing property prior to the commencement of the lease. 
       
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amounts capitalized at our properties, excluding one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations, for tenant improvements, leasing costs, building improvements and development and redevelopment activities were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(1) 
    Tenant improvements include capital expenditures used to improve tenants  space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space. 
              (2) 
    Leasing costs include leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and other tenant inducements. 
              (3) 
    Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets. 
              (4) 
    Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include (i) capital expenditures that are identified at the time of a property acquisition and incurred within a short time period after acquiring the property, and (ii) capital expenditure projects that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenue. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have estimated unspent leasing related obligations of   $21,580   and have committed to redevelop and expand an existing property at an estimated cost to complete of approximately   $17,990  . 
    
  We believe that current government budgetary pressures have resulted in a decrease in government employment, government tenants reducing their space utilization per employee and consolidation into existing government owned properties, thereby reducing the demand for government leased space. Our historical experience with respect to properties of the type we own that are majority leased to government tenants has been that government tenants frequently renew leases to avoid the costs and disruptions that may result from relocating their operations. However, relocation has become more prevalent in instances where efforts by government tenants to reduce their space utilization requires a significant reconfiguration of currently leased space. Accordingly, we are unable to reasonably project what the financial impact of market conditions or changing government financial circumstances will be on our financial results for future periods. 
    
  The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, has publicly stated that it plans to discontinue its tax return processing operations at our property located in Fresno, CA in 2021. The IRS lease for this property, which accounted for approximately   3.3%   of our annualized rental income as of September 30, 2016, expires in 2021.  The IRS has also publicly stated that it plans to  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

discontinue its tax return processing operations in Covington, KY in 2019.  Our property located in Florence, KY is leased to the IRS and we believe it is used to support these operations.  This lease, which accounted for approximately   1.0%   of our annualized rental income as of September 30, 2016, expires in 2022 but is subject to early termination rights beginning in 2017. The IRS has not notified us of its intentions regarding these properties.  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had leases totaling   970,781   rentable square feet that were scheduled to expire through September 30, 2017. As of   October 25, 2016  , tenants with leases totaling   138,936   rentable square feet that are scheduled to expire through September 30, 2017, have notified us that they do not plan to renew their leases upon expiration and we can provide no assurance as to whether additional tenants may or may not renew their leases upon expiration.  Based upon current market conditions and tenant negotiations for leases scheduled to expire through September 30, 2017, we expect that the rental rates we are likely to achieve on new or renewed leases for space under expiring leases through September 30, 2017 will, in the aggregate and on a weighted (by annualized revenues) average basis, be modestly higher than the rates currently being paid, thereby generally resulting in higher revenue from the same space. We can provide no assurance regarding the rental rates which will result from our ongoing negotiations regarding lease renewals or any new leases we may enter into; also, we may experience material declines in our rental income due to vacancies upon lease expirations.  Prevailing market conditions and government tenants' needs at the time we negotiate and enter leases will generally determine rental rates and demand for leased space in our properties, and market conditions and government tenants' needs are beyond our control. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , lease expirations at our properties, excluding one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations, by year are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(2) 
    Leased square feet is pursuant to leases existing as of   September 30, 2016  , and includes (i) space being fitted out for tenant occupancy pursuant to our lease agreements, if any, and (ii) space which is leased, but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any.  Square feet measurements are subject to changes when space is re-measured or re-configured for new tenants. 
       
           (3) 
    Leased square footage excludes a   25,579   square foot expansion to be constructed at an existing property prior to the commencement of the lease.

Acquisition and Disposition Activities (dollar amounts in thousands) 
    
  On January 29, 2016, we acquired an office property (one building) located in Sacramento, CA with   337,811   rentable square feet for a purchase price of   $79,235  , excluding acquisition costs, using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  We acquired this property at a capitalization rate of   7.2%  .  We calculate the capitalization rate for property acquisitions as the ratio of (x) annual straight line rental income, excluding the impact of above and below market lease amortization, based on leases in effect on the acquisition date, less estimated annual property operating expenses as of the acquisition date, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, to (y) the acquisition purchase price, including the principal amount of assumed debt, if any, and excluding acquisition costs. 
    
  In March 2016, we entered an agreement to sell an office property ( one building) in Falls Church, VA with   164,746   rentable square feet and a net book value of   $12,282   at   September 30, 2016  .  The contract sales price is   $13,000  , excluding closing costs.  This sale is subject to conditions, including the purchaser obtaining certain zoning entitlements, and is currently expected to occur in the first quarter of 2017.   
    
  In July 2016, we acquired certain land we leased from a third party at one of our properties in Atlanta, GA for   $1,623  , excluding acquisition costs. 
    
  Also in July 2016, we sold an office property (one building) in Savannah, GA with   35,228   rentable square feet and a net book value of   $2,986   at   September 30, 2016   for   $4,000  , excluding closing costs. In connection with this sale, we provided   $3,600   of mortgage financing to the buyer. 
    
  Also in July 2016, we entered an agreement to acquire an office property (  one   building) located in Manassas, VA with   69,374   rentable square feet for a purchase price of   $13,200  , excluding acquisition costs.  This property is   100%   leased to Prince William County.  
    
  In August 2016, we entered an agreement to acquire transferable development rights that would allow us to expand a property we own in Washington, D.C. for a purchase price of   $2,030  , excluding acquisition costs. 
    
  Our pending acquisitions and dispositions are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure that we will complete these acquisitions and dispositions or that these acquisitions and dispositions will not be delayed or the terms of these acquisitions and dispositions will not change.     
    
  Our strategy related to property acquisitions and dispositions is materially unchanged from that disclosed in our Annual Report. We continue to explore and evaluate for possible acquisition additional properties that are majority leased to government tenants; however, we cannot be sure that we will reach any agreement to acquire such properties, or that if we do reach any such agreement, that we will complete any acquisitions. Although we have not identified properties for disposition other than the property described above, we expect to periodically identify properties for sale based on future changes in market conditions, changes in property performance, our expectation regarding lease renewals, our plans with regard to particular properties or alternative opportunities we may wish to pursue. Our plans for particular properties and other strategic considerations may cause us to change our acquisition and disposition strategies, and we may do so at any time and without shareholder approval.

    Comparable properties consist of   70   properties (  90   buildings) we owned on   September 30, 2016   and which we owned continuously since July 1, 2015, and excludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations. 
              (2)

    The calculation of net operating income, or NOI, excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. We define NOI as income from our rental of real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions because we record those amounts as depreciation and amortization. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income (loss) because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and operating income as presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do. 
              (5) 
    We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, as shown above. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and the difference between FFO attributable to an equity investment and equity in earnings of an equity investee but excluding impairment charges on real estate assets, any gain or loss on sale of properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO because we include the difference between FFO and Normalized FFO attributable to our equity investment in SIR, we include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will ultimately be payable when all contingencies for determining any such fees are determined at the end of the calendar year and we exclude acquisition related costs, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, loss on impairment of SIR investment and gains or losses on issuance of shares by SIR. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss) and operating income. We believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, our receipt of distributions from SIR and our expected needs and availability of cash to pay our obligations. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and operating income as presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do. 
       
  We refer to the   70   properties (  90   buildings) we owned on   September 30, 2016   and which we have owned continuously since July 1, 2015, excluding one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations, as comparable properties. We refer to the one property (one building) we acquired during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as the acquired property. We refer to the one property (one building) we sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as the disposed property. 
    
  Our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   include the operating results of the acquired property for the entire period, as we acquired this property prior to July 1, 2016, and include the operating results of the disposed property for less than the entire period, as that property was sold during the period.  Our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   exclude the operating results of the acquired property for the entire period, as we acquired that property after   September 30, 2015  , and include the operating results of the disposed property for the entire period, as we sold that property after September 30, 2015. 
    
  References to changes in the income and expense categories below relate to the comparison of consolidated results for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Rental income.     The increase   in rental income reflects an increase in rental income for comparable properties and the effect of the acquired property partially offset by the effect of the disposed property. Rental income increased   $2,180   as a result of the acquired property.  Rental income decreased   $20   as a result of the disposed property.  Rental income for comparable properties   increased     $226   due primarily to an increase in occupied space at certain of our properties in the   2016   period.  Rental income includes non-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling   $1,205   in the   2016   period and   $613   in the   2015   period, and amortization of acquired leases and assumed lease obligations totaling   ($370)   in the   2016   period and   ($298)   in the   2015   period. 
    
  Real estate taxes.     The decrease   in real estate taxes reflects a decrease in real estate taxes for comparable properties partially offset by the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed property. Real estate taxes increased   $205   as a result of the acquired property.  Real estate taxes decreased   $18   as a result of the disposed property. Real estate taxes for comparable properties decreased   $331   due primarily to the effect of lower real estate tax valuation assessments at certain of our properties in the   2016   period.

     Table of Contents  

Utility expenses.     The increase   in utility expenses reflects an increase in utility expenses for comparable properties and the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed property. Utility expenses increased   $213   as a result of the acquired property.  Utility expenses declined   $14   as a result of the disposed property.  Utility expenses at comparable properties increased   $90   primarily due to an increase in electricity usage at certain of our buildings during the   2016   period compared to the   2015   period. 
    
  Other operating expenses.   Other operating expenses consist of salaries and benefit costs of property level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, cleaning expense, other direct costs of operating our properties and property management fees, net of amortization of the liability we recorded in connection with our June 2015 acquisition of shares of Class A common stock of The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc. (see Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).   The increase   in other operating expenses reflects an increase in expenses for comparable properties and the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed property. Other operating expenses increased   $579   as a result of the acquired property. Other operating expenses declined   $25   as a result of the disposed property. Other operating expenses at comparable properties   increased     $1,019   primarily as a result of higher salaries, cleaning and repairs and maintenance costs at certain of our properties during the   2016   period. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization.     The increase   in depreciation and amortization reflects the effect of the property acquisition and improvements made to certain of our properties, partially offset by the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization increased   $1,255   as a result of the acquired property. Depreciation and amortization at comparable properties declined   $12   due primarily to certain depreciable leasing related assets becoming fully depreciated after July 1,   2015  , partially offset by depreciation and amortization of improvements made to certain of our properties after July 1, 2015. 
    
  Acquisition related costs.   Acquisition related costs in both the   2016   and   2015   periods include legal and due diligence costs incurred in connection with our property acquisition activity. 
    
  General and administrative.   General and administrative expenses consist of fees pursuant to our business management agreement, net of amortization of the liability we recorded in connection with our June 2015 acquisition of RMR Inc. shares (see Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), equity compensation expense, legal and accounting fees, Trustees  fees and expenses, securities listing and transfer agency fees and other costs relating to our status as a publicly traded company. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily as a result of an increase in stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in other professional fees during the   2016   period. 
    
  Dividend income.   Dividend income consists of dividends received from our investment in RMR Inc. during the   2016   period. 
    
  Interest income.   The increase in interest income is primarily the result of interest earned from the mortgage financing we provided to the purchaser of one of our properties during the 2016 period. For more information, see Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Interest expense.   The increase in interest expense reflects higher average outstanding debt balances and higher weighted average interest rates on borrowings during the   2016   period compared to the   2015   period. 
    
  Gain on early extinguishment of debt  .  We recorded a $34 gain on early extinguishment of debt in the 2015 period in connection with the repayment of a mortgage note. 
    
  Gain (loss) on issuance of shares by Select Income REIT.   Gain (loss) on issuance of shares by SIR is a result of the issuance of common shares by SIR at prices above or (below) our then per share carrying value of our SIR common shares. 
     
  Income tax (expense) benefit.   The change in income tax (expense) benefit reflects higher operating income in certain jurisdictions in the   2016   period that is subject to state income taxes, compared to a decrease in our accrued state income tax liability in the   2015   period due to lower estimated operating income in certain jurisdictions. 
    
  Equity in earnings of investees.   Equity in earnings of investees represents our proportionate share of earnings from our investments in SIR and Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC. 
    
  Loss from discontinued operations.   Loss from discontinued operations reflects operating results for one property (one building) included in discontinued operations during the   2016   and   2015   periods.

  Rental income.     The increase   in rental income reflects an increase in rental income for comparable properties and the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed properties.  Rental income increased   $5,852   as a result of the acquired property.  Rental income declined   $1,801   as a result of the disposed properties.  Rental income for comparable properties   increased     $1,235   due primarily to an increase in occupied space at certain of our properties in the   2016   period.  Rental income includes non-cash straight line rent adjustments totaling   $1,789   in the 2016 period and   $2,820   in the   2015   period, and amortization of acquired leases and assumed lease obligations totaling   ($1,103)   in the   2016   period and   ($862)   in the   2015   period. 
    
  Real estate taxes.     The decrease   in real estate taxes reflects the decrease in real estate taxes for comparable properties partially offset by the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed properties. Real estate taxes increased   $524   as a result of the acquired property.  Real estate taxes declined   $217   as a result of the disposed properties.  Real estate taxes for comparable properties   declined     $316   due primarily to the effect of lower real estate tax valuation assessments at certain of our properties in the   2016   period. 
    
  Utility expenses.     The decrease   in utility expenses reflects a decrease in utility expenses for comparable properties partially offset by the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed properties. Utility expenses increased   $417   as a result of the acquired property.  Utility expenses declined   $129   as a result of the disposed properties.  Utility expenses at comparable properties   declined     $746   primarily due to milder temperatures experienced in certain parts of the United States during the   2016   period compared to the   2015   period. 
    
  Other operating expenses.     The increase   in other operating expenses reflects an increase in expenses for comparable properties and the net effect of the acquired property and the disposed properties. Other operating expenses increased   $1,438   as a result of the acquired property.  Other operating expenses declined   $376   as a result of the disposed properties.  Other operating expenses at comparable properties   increased     $2,310   primarily as a result of higher salaries, cleaning and insurance costs at certain of our properties partially offset by lower snow removal costs at certain of our properties during the   2016   period. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization.     The increase   in depreciation and amortization reflects the effect of the property acquisition and improvements made to certain of our properties, partially offset by the effect of certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization increased   $3,343   as a result of the acquired property. Depreciation and amortization at comparable properties   declined     $305   due primarily to certain depreciable leasing related assets becoming fully depreciated after January 1,   2015  , partially offset by depreciation and amortization of improvements made to certain of our properties after January 1, 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our Operating Liquidity and Resources (dollar amounts in thousands) 
    
  Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses, debt service obligations and pay distributions on our common shares are the operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our properties, the distributions we receive from our investment in SIR and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations and pay distributions on our common shares for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon:  
             
    our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties; 
                
    our ability to control operating expenses at our properties; 
                
    our ability to purchase additional properties which produce cash flows from operations in excess of our cost of acquisition capital and property operating expenses; and 
     
   32 

     Table of Contents  

our receipt of distributions from our investment in SIR. 
       
  Our future purchases of properties cannot be accurately projected because such purchases depend upon purchase opportunities which come to our attention and our ability to successfully conclude the acquisitions. We generally do not intend to purchase  turn around  properties, or properties which do not generate positive cash flows. 
    
  Our changes in cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   were as follows: (i) cash provided by operating activities increased from   $89,053   in   2015   to   $91,674   in   2016  ; (ii) cash used in investing activities increased from   $65,793   in   2015   to   $94,848   in   2016  ; and (iii) cash flows from financing activities changed from   $25,745   of cash used in financing activities in   2015   to   $8,138   of cash provided by financing activities in   2016  . 
    
  The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily reflects an increase in property net operating income and an increase in distributions of earnings received from our investment in SIR common shares, partially offset by changes in working capital in the   2016   period. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due primarily to our real estate acquisition activity in the   2016   period versus disposition activity in the   2015   period, partially offset by our investment in SIR in the   2015   period. The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due primarily to an increase in net borrowings in the   2016   period, including our issuance of senior unsecured notes. 
    
  Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share and per square foot amounts) 
    
  In order to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a $750,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is January 31, 2019 and, subject to our payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have an option to extend the stated maturity date of our revolving credit facility by one year to January 31, 2020. We are required to pay interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a premium, which was 125 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  , on the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We also pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, which was 25 basis points per annum at   September 30, 2016  . Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.7%  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   October 25, 2016  , we had   $25,000   and   $15,000  , respectively, outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Our revolving credit facility is governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders, which also governs our two unsecured term loans: 

Our credit agreement also includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing availability may be increased to up to $2,500,000 on a combined basis in certain circumstances. 
    
  Our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loans provides that, with certain exceptions, a subsidiary of ours is required to guaranty our obligations under the revolving credit facility and term loans only if that subsidiary has  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

separately incurred debt (other than nonrecourse debt), within the meaning specified in the credit agreement, or provided a guarantee of debt incurred by us or any of our other subsidiaries. 
    
  Our $350,000 of 3.75% senior unsecured notes require semi-annual payments of interest only through maturity in August 2019 and may be repaid at par (plus accrued and unpaid interest) on or after July 15, 2019 or before that date together with a make whole premium. 
       
  In May 2016, we issued $300,000 of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2046 in an underwritten public offering. In June 2016, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase an additional $10,000 of these notes. The net proceeds from this offering of   $299,771  , after offering expenses, were used to repay all amounts then outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes.  
    
  Our debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility) are as follows:   $369   in   2016  ,   $1,549   in   2017  ,   $1,671   in   2018  ,   $359,439   in   2019  ,   $301,619   in   2020   and   $573,230   thereafter.  
    
  None of our debt obligations require sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates.  Our   $27,877   in mortgage debts generally require monthly payments of principal and interest through maturity. 
  In addition to our debt obligations, as of   September 30, 2016  , we have estimated unspent leasing related obligations of   $21,580   and have committed to redevelop and expand an existing property at an estimated cost to complete of approximately   $17,990  . 
    
  We currently expect to use cash balances, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from our property sales, distributions received from our investment in SIR, assumption of mortgage debt and net proceeds from offerings of equity or debt securities to fund our future operations, capital expenditures, distributions to our shareholders and property acquisitions. When significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility or the maturity date of our revolving credit facility, term loans, senior notes, mortgage notes or our other debts approach, we intend to explore alternatives for repaying or refinancing such amounts. Such alternatives may include incurring additional term debt, issuing equity or debt securities, extending the maturity date of our revolving credit facility and entering into a new revolving credit facility. We may assume additional mortgage debt in connection with our acquisition of properties or elect to place new mortgages on properties we own as a source of financing. Although we cannot be sure that we will be successful in consummating any particular type of financing, we believe that we will have access to financing, such as debt and equity offerings, to fund future acquisitions and capital expenditures and to pay our obligations. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. 
  Our ability to obtain, and the costs of, our future financings will depend primarily on market conditions and our creditworthiness. We have no control over market conditions. Potential investors and lenders likely will evaluate our ability to pay distributions to shareholders, fund required debt service and repay debts when they become due by reviewing our business practices and plans to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial profile and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully carry out this intention. 
    
  On   February 25, 2016  , we paid a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of $0.43 per share, or approximately   $30,584  . On May 23, 2016, we paid a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of $0.43 per share, or approximately   $30,585  . On August 22, 2016, we paid a regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders of record on July 22, 2016 of   $0.43   per share, or   $30,590  .  On October 11, 2016, we declared a regular quarterly distribution payable to common shareholders of record on October 21, 2016 of   $0.43   per share, or approximately   $30,607  . We expect to pay this amount on or about November 21, 2016 using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  In February 2016, we repaid, at par, a $23,473 mortgage note requiring annual interest at 6.21% which was secured by one office property (one building) located in Landover, MD using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. This mortgage note was scheduled to mature in August 2016. 
    
  In March 2016, we repaid, at par, an $83,000 mortgage note requiring annual interest at 5.55% which was secured by one office property (two buildings) located in Reston, VA using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  This mortgage note was scheduled to mature in April 2016.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
    
  Debt Covenants (dollars in thousands) 
    
  Our principal debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   consisted of borrowings under our $750,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, our $300,000 term loan, our $250,000 term loan, an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $660,000 of public issuances of senior unsecured notes and three secured mortgage notes that were assumed in connection with certain of our acquisitions. Our publicly issued senior unsecured notes are governed by an indenture.  Our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplements and the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and our two term loans provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC, ceasing to act as our business manager and property manager. Our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplements and our credit agreement also contain a number of covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, require us to maintain various financial ratios, and, in the case of our credit agreement, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances. Our mortgage notes are non-recourse, subject to certain limited exceptions, and do not contain any material financial covenants.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of our respective covenants under our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplements and our credit agreement. 
  Neither our credit agreement nor our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our credit agreement our highest senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay. Accordingly, if that debt rating is downgraded by certain credit rating agencies, our interest expense and related costs under our credit agreement would increase. 
  Our credit agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of $25,000 or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of $50,000 or more. Similarly, our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of more than $25,000 (or up to $50,000 in certain circumstances). 
  Related Person Transactions 
    
  We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR LLC, SIR and others related to them.  For example, we have no employees and the personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR LLC pursuant to management agreements; RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC and we own shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc.; and the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., ABP Trust, is owned by our Managing Trustees and ABP Trust also owns an equity interest in RMR LLC. Also, we own common shares of SIR; and we and six other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services own in equal amounts AIC, an insurance company, and we participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and reinsured in part by AIC. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, please see Notes 10 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our   2016   Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  In addition, please see the section captioned  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships.  Our filings with the SEC and copies of certain of our agreements with these related parties are publicly available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC s website, www.sec.gov.  We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including RMR LLC and companies to which RMR LLC or its affiliates provide management services.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     (dollar amounts in thousands) 
    
  We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates has not materially changed since   December 31, 2015  . Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
    
  Fixed Rate Debt 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding fixed rate debt consisted of the following: 

(1) 
    The principal balances and interest rates are the amounts determined pursuant to the contracts. In accordance with GAAP, our carrying values and recorded interest expense may differ from these amounts because of market conditions at the time we issued or assumed these debts.  For more information, see Notes 7 and 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
       
  Our $350,000 senior unsecured notes require semi-annual interest payments through maturity and our $310,000 senior unsecured notes require quarterly interest payments through maturity.  Our mortgages generally require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to amortization schedules.  Because these debts require interest at a fixed rate, changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations.  If these debts were refinanced at interest rates which are 100 basis points higher or lower than shown above, our per annum interest cost would increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately   $7,097  . 
    
  Changes in market interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt, while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt.  Based on the balances outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , and discounted cash flow analyses through the respective maturity dates, and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would change the fair value of those obligations by approximately   $50,096  . 
    
  Some of our fixed rate secured debt arrangements allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date. In some cases, we are not allowed to make early repayment prior to a cutoff date and we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount, as defined, which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder. These prepayment rights may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risk of refinancing our debts at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity. 
    
  Floating Rate Debt 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our floating rate debt consisted of   $25,000   of borrowings under our $750,000 revolving credit facility, our $300,000 term loan and our $250,000 term loan. Our revolving credit facility matures in January 2019 and, subject to the payment of an extension fee and our meeting other conditions, we have the option to extend the stated maturity by one year to January 2020. No principal repayments are required under our revolving credit facility or our term loans prior to maturity, and we can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility, subject to conditions, at any time without penalty. Our $300,000 term loan matures on March 31, 2020. Our $250,000 term loan matures on March 31, 2022. Amounts outstanding under our term loans may be repaid at any time, but after they are repaid amounts may not be redrawn. Our $300,000 term loan may be repaid without penalty at any time. If our $250,000 term loan is repaid on or prior to November 21, 2016, a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the amount repaid would be incurred.  Subsequent to November 21, 2016, no prepayment premium would be incurred.

     Table of Contents  

Borrowings under our $750,000 revolving credit facility and term loans are in U.S. dollars and require interest at a rate of LIBOR plus premiums that are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term rates, specifically LIBOR. In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility or term loans, we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums due to market conditions or our perceived credit characteristics. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of our floating rate debt but would affect our operating results. 
    
  The following table presents the impact a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Weighted based on the respective interest rates and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Based on the weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  The following table presents the impact a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of   September 30, 2016   if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility and our term loans remained outstanding: 

(1) 
    Weighted based on the respective interest rates and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility (assuming fully drawn) and our term loans as of   September 30, 2016  .  
              (2) 
    Based on the weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  The foregoing tables show the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  .  If interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility, our term loans or our other floating rate debt, if any. Although we have no present plans to do so, we may in the future enter into hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Managing Trustees, our President and Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Managing Trustees, our President and Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    ACTS OF TERRORISM, OUTBREAKS OF SO CALLED PANDEMICS OR OTHER MANMADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. 
       
  FOR EXAMPLE: 

OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND TO MAKE FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FUTURE EARNINGS, THE CAPITAL COSTS WE INCUR TO LEASE OUR PROPERTIES AND OUR RECEIPT OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SIR,  
                
    WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT RATE OF DISTRIBUTIONS ON OUR COMMON SHARES AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED, 
                
    OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND INCREASE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO BUY PROPERTIES AND LEASE THEM FOR RENTS, LESS PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, THAT EXCEED OUR CAPITAL COSTS. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES THAT WE WANT TO ACQUIRE OR TO NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE PURCHASE PRICES, ACQUISITION FINANCING OR LEASE TERMS FOR NEW PROPERTIES, 
                
    SOME OF OUR TENANTS MAY NOT RENEW EXPIRING LEASES, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN NEW TENANTS TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THE HISTORICAL OCCUPANCY RATES OF, OR RENTS FROM, OUR PROPERTIES, 
                
    SOME GOVERNMENT TENANTS MAY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS TO VACATE THEIR SPACE BEFORE THE STATED EXPIRATION OF THEIR LEASES, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN NEW TENANTS TO MAINTAIN THE HISTORICAL OCCUPANCY RATES OF, OR RENTS FROM, OUR PROPERTIES, 
                
    RENTS THAT WE CAN CHARGE AT OUR PROPERTIES MAY DECLINE BECAUSE OF CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE, 
                
    CONTINGENCIES IN OUR ACQUISITION AND SALE AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND SALES MAY NOT OCCUR, MAY BE DELAYED OR THE TERMS OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY CHANGE, 
                
    CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO OUR SATISFYING CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SATISFY, 
     
   39 

     Table of Contents  

ACTUAL COSTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER FLOATING RATE CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE HIGHER THAN LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM BECAUSE OF OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FACILITIES, 
                
    WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REPAY OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME DUE, 

THE MAXIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOANS MAY BE INCREASED TO UP TO $2.5 BILLION ON A COMBINED BASIS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES; HOWEVER, INCREASING THE MAXIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOANS IS SUBJECT TO OUR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM LENDERS, WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR, 

WE HAVE THE OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UPON PAYMENT OF A FEE AND MEETING OTHER CONDITIONS.  HOWEVER, THE APPLICABLE CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE MET, 
                
    THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND RMR LLC HAVE CONTINUING 20 YEAR TERMS.  HOWEVER, THOSE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE TERMS WHICH PERMIT EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR CONTINUING 20 YEAR TERMS OR FOR SHORTER TERMS, 
                
    WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RELATED PARTIES, INCLUDING RMR LLC, RMR INC., SIR, AIC AND OTHERS AFFILIATED WITH THEM MAY BENEFIT US AND PROVIDE US WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN OPERATING AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THE ADVANTAGES WE BELIEVE WE MAY REALIZE FROM THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE, 

THE PREMIUMS USED TO DETERMINE THE INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOANS AND THE FACILITY FEE PAYABLE ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS.  FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY CAUSE THE INTEREST AND FEES WE PAY TO INCREASE, 
                
    SIR MAY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ITS DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING US, 
                
    WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL OUR SIR COMMON SHARES FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO OUR CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE SHARES AND ANY SUCH SALE MAY BE AT A DISCOUNT TO MARKET PRICE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE SIZE OF OUR SIR HOLDINGS OR OTHERWISE; WE MAY REALIZE A LOSS ON OUR INVESTMENT IN OUR SIR SHARES, AND 
                
    WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY   $18.0   MILLION TO COMPLETE OUR  REDEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF AN EXISTING PROPERTY IN CONNECTION WITH A NEW LEASE AGREEMENT.  IN ADDITION, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, WE HAVE ESTIMATED UNSPENT LEASING RELATED OBLIGATIONS OF   $21.6   MILLION, WHICH EXCLUDES THE ESTIMATED DEVELOPMENT COSTS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND OUR UNSPENT LEASING RELATED OBLIGATIONS MAY COST MORE OR LESS AND MAY TAKE LONGER TO COMPLETE THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT, AND WE MAY INCUR INCREASING AMOUNTS FOR THESE AND SIMILAR PURPOSES IN THE FUTURE. 
       
  CURRENTLY UNEXPECTED RESULTS COULD OCCUR DUE TO MANY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT TENANTS  NEEDS FOR LEASED SPACE, ACTS OF TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS OR CHANGES IN CAPITAL MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY GENERALLY.

EXHIBIT 10.1 
    
  GOVERNMENT PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST 
  Share Award Agreement 
  This Share Award Agreement (this  Agreement ) is made as of  DATE , 2016, between  NAME  (the  Recipient ) and Government Properties Income Trust (the  Company ). 
  In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.      Grant of Shares  .  Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and the terms and conditions of the Government Properties Income Trust 2009 Incentive Share Award Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the  Plan ), the Company hereby grants to the Recipient, effective as of the date of this Agreement,  NUMBER  of its common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share (the  Common Shares ).  The shares so granted are hereinafter referred to as the  Shares,  which term shall also include any shares of the Company issued to the Recipient by virtue of his or her ownership of the Shares, by share dividend, share split or combination, recapitalization or otherwise. 
  2.      Vesting; Repurchase of Shares  . 
  (a)    Subject to Sections 2(b) and 2(c) hereof, the Shares shall vest one-fifth of the total number of Shares as of the date hereof and as to a further one-fifth of such total number of Shares on each anniversary of the date hereof for the next four calendar years.  Any Shares not vested as of any date are herein referred to as  Unvested Shares.  
  (b)    Subject to Section 2(c) hereof, at the option of the Company, in the event the Recipient ceases to render significant services, whether as an employee or otherwise, to (i) the Company, (ii) the entity which is the manager or shared services provider to the Company or an entity controlled by, under common control with or controlling such entity (collectively, the  Manager ), or (iii) an affiliate of the Company (which shall be deemed for such purpose to include any other entity to which the Manager is the manager or shared services provider), all or any portion of the Unvested Shares shall be forfeited by the Recipient as of the date the Recipient ceases to render all such services.  The Company may exercise such option by delivering or mailing to the Recipient (or his or her estate), at any time after the Recipient has ceased to render such services, a written notice of exercise of such option.  Such notice shall specify the number of Unvested Shares to be forfeited. 
  (c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately upon the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined below), all of the Unvested Shares shall vest and any forfeiture or other rights of the Company described in Section 2(b) shall lapse in their entirety, and such vesting and lapse of forfeiture or other Company rights shall also immediately apply to each other Common Share previously granted to the Recipient which then remains subject to comparable restrictions and rights.  For  

purposes of this Section 2(c), an Acceleration Event shall be deemed to occur immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: a Change in Control, a Termination Event (as each such term is defined in Exhibit A hereto) or the death of the Recipient. 
  3.      Legends  .  Vested and Unvested Shares granted under this Agreement may bear or contain, as applicable, such legends and notations as may be required by the Plan or the Company s declaration of trust, any applicable supplement thereto or bylaws, each as in effect from time to time, or as the Company may otherwise determine appropriate. 
  Promptly following the request of the Recipient with respect to any Shares (or any other Common Shares previously granted to the Recipient), the Company shall take, at its sole cost and expense, all such actions as may be required to permit the Recipient to sell such shares including, as applicable and without limitation, providing to the Company s transfer agent certificates of officers of the Company, and opinions of counsel and/or filing an appropriate registration statement, and taking all such other actions as may be required to remove the legends set forth above with respect to transfer and vesting restrictions from the certificates evidencing such shares and, if applicable, from the share books and records of the Company.  The Company shall reimburse the Recipient, promptly upon the receipt of a request for payment, for all expenses (including legal expenses) reasonably incurred by the Recipient in connection with the enforcement of the Recipient s rights under this paragraph.   
  4.      Tax Withholding  .  To the extent required by law, the Company or the Manager shall withhold or cause to be withheld income and other taxes incurred by the Recipient by reason of a grant of Shares, and the Recipient agrees that he or she shall, upon the request of the Company or the Manager, pay to the Company or to the Manager an amount sufficient to satisfy his or her tax withholding obligations from time to time (including as Shares become vested). 
  5.      Miscellaneous  . 
  (a)      Amendments  .  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed or modified except by an agreement in writing executed by the Recipient and the Company; provided, however, that any change or modification that does not adversely affect the rights hereunder of the Recipient, as they may exist immediately prior to the effective date of such change or modification, may be adopted by the Company without an agreement in writing executed by the Recipient, and the Company shall give the Recipient written notice of such change or modification reasonably promptly following the adoption of such change or modification. 
  (b)      Binding Effect of the Agreement  .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon , the Company, the Recipient and their respective estates, heirs, executors, transferees, successors, assigns and legal representatives. 
  (c)      Provisions Separable  .
