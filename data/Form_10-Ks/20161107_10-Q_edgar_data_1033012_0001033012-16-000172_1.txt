  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Note   1     Basis of Presentation  
    
  The accompanying financial statements of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. ("Flagstar," or the "Company"), including its wholly owned principal subsidiary, Flagstar Bank, FSB (the "Bank"), have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial statements. Where we say "we," "us," or "our," we usually mean Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. However, in some cases, a reference to "we," "us," or "our" will include our wholly owned subsidiary Flagstar Bank, FSB (the "Bank"). 
    
  These consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for a full year presentation and certain disclosures have been condensed or omitted in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These interim financial statements are unaudited and include, in our opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods indicated, which are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for the full year. These consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which is available on our website, at flagstar.com, and on the SEC website, at sec.gov. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  

Note   2     Investment Securities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , investment securities were comprised of the following: 

(1) 
    There were   no   securities of a single issuer, which are not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded   10 percent   of stockholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Credit related declines in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities that are determined to be other than temporary are reported as a separate component of noninterest income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. An impaired investment security is considered to be other than temporary if (1) we intend to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments.  
    
  We evaluate our securities portfolio each quarter to determine if any security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired. In making this evaluation, management considers its ability and intent to hold securities to recover current market losses. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we had   no   other than temporary impairments.  
    
  Available-for-sale securities 
    
    Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and unrealized losses, to the extent they are temporary in nature, reported as a component of other comprehensive income.  
    
  We purchased   $136 million   and   $203 million  , of available-for-sale securities, which included U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal obligations, during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. We purchased   $59 million   and   $783 million  , of available-for-sale securities, which included U.S. government sponsored agencies comprised of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage and municipal obligations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. During the third quarter 2015, we subsequently transferred   $462 million   of the securities purchased to held-to-maturity investments. 
    
  Gains (losses) on sales of available-for-sale securities are reported in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   $115 million   and   $290 million  , respectively, in sales of available-for-sale securities, which did not include those related to mortgage loans that had been securitized for sale in the normal course of business. These sales resulted in a realized gain of   $3 million   and   $4 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. During both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   there were   no   sales of available-for-sale securities, except those related to mortgage loans that had been securitized for sale in the normal course of business. 
    
  Held-to-maturity securities 
    
  Investment securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method. Unrealized losses are not recorded to the extent they are temporary in nature. 
    
  Transfers of investment securities into the held-to-maturity category from the available-for-sale category are accounted for at fair value on the date of transfer. The related unrealized gain, net of tax that was included in the transfer is retained in other comprehensive income amortizing as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of the securities. During the third quarter   2015  , we transferred   $1.1 billion   of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity securities at a premium of   $8 million  , reflecting our intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. The related   $5 million   of unrealized holding gain, net of tax, that was included in the transfer is retained in other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining life of the securities. There were   no   gains or losses recognized as a result of this transfer.  
    
  We purchased   zero   and   $15 million   of held-to-maturity securities, which included U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. During both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we purchased   $10 million   of held-to-maturity securities. 
    
  Gains (losses) on sales of held-to-maturity securities are reported in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were   no   sales of held-to-maturity securities. During both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , there were no maturities and   $25 million   of maturities in held-to-maturity securities, respectively.

The following table summarizes by duration the unrealized loss positions on investment securities:    

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities at   September 30, 2016  , are presented below by contractual maturity: 

We pledge investment securities, primarily municipal taxable and agency collateralized mortgage obligations, to collateralize lines of credit and/or borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , we had pledged investment securities of   $918 million   compared to   $14 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  

Note   3     Loans Held-for-Sale 
    
  The majority of our mortgage loans originated as loans held-for-sale are sold into the secondary market on a whole loan basis or by securitizing the loans and selling the securities. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans held-for-sale totaled   $3.4 billion   and   $2.6 billion  , respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had net gains on loan sales associated with loans held-for-sale, excluding the gains from the sale of mortgage loans transferred from loans held-for-investment, of   $94 million   and   $244 million  , respectively, as compared to   $68 million   and   $242 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
       
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $40 million   and   $35 million  , respectively, of loans held-for-sale were recorded at lower of cost or fair value. The remainder of the loans in the portfolio are recorded at fair value as we have elected the fair value option for such loans.

Note   4     Loans Held-for-Investment 
    
    Loans held-for-investment are summarized as follows: 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we transferred   $2 million   and   $30 million  , respectively, of loans held-for-sale to loans held-for-investment, based upon a change in our intent. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold nonperforming, TDR and non-agency loans with unpaid principal balances of   $110 million  . Upon a change in our intent, the loans were transferred to held-for-sale and subsequently sold resulting in a loss on sale of   $2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which is recorded in net loss on sale of assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The loans sold also resulted in a charge-off of   $8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Also, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold performing residential first mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances of   $1.2 billion  . Upon a change in our intent, the loans were transferred to held-for-sale and subsequently sold resulting in a gain of   $14 million  , which is recorded in net gain on loan sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold or transferred interest-only residential first mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances totaling   $600 million  , along with   $420 million   of nonperforming troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") and non-agency first mortgage loans. Upon a change in our intent, the loans were transferred to held-for-sale and subsequently sold resulting in a net loss on sale of less than   $1 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The loans sold also resulted in a charge-off of   $67 million  .  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased jumbo residential first mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of   $150 million   and a premium of   $1 million  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we purchased   $197 million   of home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") loans with a premium of   $7 million  . 
    
  We have pledged certain loans held-for-investment, loans held-for-sale, and loans with government guarantees to collateralize lines of credit and/or borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had pledged loans of   $5.6 billion   and   $5.8 billion  , respectively. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  We determine the appropriate estimate of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. Refer to Note 1, "Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a description of the methodology. The all

     Table of Contents  

owance for loan losses, other than for loans that have been identified for individual evaluation for impairment, is determined on a loan pool basis by grouping loan types with common risk characteristics to determine our best estimate of incurred losses.  
    
  The allowance for loan losses by class of loan are summarized in the following table: 

(1) 
    Includes allowance and charge-offs related to loans with government guarantees. 
              (2) 
    Includes charge-offs of   zero   and   $16 million   related to the transfer and subsequent sale of loans during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and   $8 million   and   $67 million   related to the sale of loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Also includes charge-offs related to loans with government guarantees of   $6 million   and   $13 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
              (3) 
    Does not include   $7 million   provision for loan losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to reserve for repossessed loans with government guarantees during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

     Table of Contents  

The loans held-for-investment and allowance for loan losses by class of loan is summarized in the following table:   
   
           (1) 
    Includes allowance related to loans with government guarantees. 
              (2) 
    Excludes loans carried under the fair value option.

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth the loans held-for-investment aging analysis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , of past due and current loans: 

(1) 
    Includes loans that are less than 90 days past due, which have been placed on nonaccrual. 
        
  For all classes within the consumer and commercial loan portfolio, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due (or are determined to be impaired), or earlier when we become aware of information indicating that collection of principal and interest is in doubt. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued interest income is reversed. Loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible.  
    
  Interest income is recognized on nonaccrual loans using a cash basis method. Interest that would have been accrued on impaired loans totaled   $1 million   and   $2 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1 million   and   $4 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   loans 90 days past due and still accruing.

     Table of Contents  

Troubled Debt Restructuring 
       
  We may modify certain loans in both consumer and commercial loan portfolios to retain customers or to maximize collection of the outstanding loan balance. We have programs designed to assist borrowers by extending payment dates or reducing the borrower's contractual payments. All loan modifications are made on a case-by-case basis. Our standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other factors, minimum verified income requirements, cash flow analysis, and collateral valuations. TDRs result in those instances in which a borrower demonstrates financial difficulty and for which a concession has been granted, which includes reductions of interest rate, extensions of amortization period, principal and/or interest forgiveness and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. These loans are classified as nonperforming TDRs if the loan was nonperforming prior to the restructuring, or based upon the results of a contemporaneous credit evaluation. Such loans will continue on nonaccrual status until the borrower has established a willingness and ability to make the restructured payments for at least six months, after which they will begin to accrue interest. 
    
  Some loan modifications classified as TDRs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest, as modified, but may give rise to potential incremental losses. We measure impairments using a discounted cash flow method for performing TDRs and measure impairment based on collateral values for re-defaulted TDRs. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of TDRs outstanding by type and performing status:

Credit Quality 
    
  We utilize an internal risk rating system in accordance with the Rating Credit Risk booklet of the Comptroller's Handbook, April 2011 and the Uniform Retail Credit classification and Account Management Policy issued June 20, 2000 by the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council ("FFIEC") which is applied to all consumer and commercial loans. Descriptions of our internal risk ratings as they relate to credit quality follow the ratings used by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies as listed below. 
    
  Pass.   Pass assets are not impaired nor do they have any known deficiencies that could impact the quality of the asset. 
    
  Watch.   Watch assets are defined as pass rated assets that exhibit elevated risk characteristics or other factors that deserve management s close attention and increased monitoring. However, the asset does not exhibit a potential or well-defined weakness that would warrant a downgrade to criticized or adverse classification. 
    
  Special mention.   Assets identified as special mention possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management's close attention. Special mention assets have a potential weakness or pose an unwarranted financial risk that, if not corrected, could weaken the assets and increase risk in the future. Special mention assets are criticized, but do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
    
    Substandard  . Assets identified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. For HELOC loans and other consumer loans, we evaluate credit quality based on the aging and status of payment activity and any other known credit characteristics that call into question full repayment of the asset. Nonperforming loans are classified as either substandard, doubtful or loss. 
    
    Doubtful  . An asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. A doubtful asset has a high probability of total or substantial loss, but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the asset, its classification as loss is deferred. Doubtful borrowers are usually in default, lack adequate liquidity or capital, and lack the resources necessary to remain an operating entity. Pending events can include mergers, acquisitions, liquidations, capital injections, the perfection of liens on additional collateral, the valuation of collateral, and refinancing. Generally, pending events should be resolved within a relatively short period and the ratings will be adjusted based on the new information. Because of high probability of loss, non-accrual accounting treatment is required for doubtful assets. 
    
  Loss.   An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but, rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 
    
  Commercial Loans 
    
  Management conducts periodic examinations which serve as an independent verification of the accuracy of the ratings assigned. Loan grades are based on different factors within the borrowing relationship: entity sales, debt service coverage, debt/total net worth, liquidity, balance sheet and income statement trends, management experience, business stability, financing structure of the deal, and financial reporting requirements. The underlying collateral is also rated based on the specific type of collateral and corresponding loan-to-value ("LTV"). The combination of the borrower and collateral risk ratings result in the final rating for the borrowing relationship.  
    
  Consumer Loans 
    
  Consumer loans consist of open and closed end loans extended to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures, and includes consumer loans, loans to individuals secured by their personal residence, including first mortgage, home equity, and home improvement loans. Because consumer loans are usually relatively small-balance, homogeneous exposures, consumer loans are rated primarily on payment performance. Payment performance is a proxy for the strength of repayment capacity and loans are generally classified based on their payment status rather than by an individual review of each loan. 
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

In accordance with regulatory guidance, we assign risk ratings to consumer loans in the following manner: 
     Consumer loans are classified as Watch once the loan becomes 60 days past due. 
     Open and closed-end consumer loans 90 days or more past due are classified Substandard. 

Note   5     Loans with Government Guarantees 
       
  Substantially all loans with government guarantees are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. FHA loans earn interest at a rate based upon the   10  -year U.S. Treasury note rate at the time the underlying loan becomes delinquent, which is not paid by the FHA until claimed. Certain loans within our portfolio may be subject to indemnifications and insurance limits which exposes us to limited credit risk. We have reserved for these risks within other assets and as a component of our allowance for loan losses on residential first mortgages. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans with government guarantees totaled   $404 million   and   $485 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , repossessed assets and the associated claims recorded in other assets totaled   $152 million   and   $210 million  , respectively.

Note   6     Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs")  
    
  In 2015, we executed clean-up calls of the FSTAR 2005-1 and FSTAR 2006-2 long-term debt associated with the HELOC securitization trusts. As a result, the FSTAR 2005-1 and FSTAR 2006-2 HELOC securitization trusts were dissolved and we have no consolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  We have a continuing involvement, but are not the primary beneficiary for   one   unconsolidated VIE related to the FSTAR 2007-1 mortgage securitization trust. In accordance with the settlement agreement with MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA"), there is no further recourse to us related to FSTAR 2007-1, unless MBIA fails to meet their obligations. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the FSTAR 2007-1 mortgage securitization trust included   2,608   loans and   3,061   loans, respectively, with an aggregate principal balance of   $96 million   and   $117 million  , respectively.  

Note   7     Mortgage Servicing Rights 
    
  We have investments in mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing. The primary risk associated with MSRs is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted, in part, by declining interest rates or government intervention. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. We utilize derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the MSRs resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments. There is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected increases in default rates, which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives. See Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for further information regarding the derivative instruments utilized to manage our MSR risks. 
    
  Changes in the carrying value of residential first mortgage MSRs, accounted for at fair value, were as follows: 

(1) 
    Changes in fair value are included within net (loss) return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (2) 
    Represents estimated MSR value change resulting primarily from market-driven changes. 
       
  The following table summarizes the hypothetical effect on the fair value of servicing rights carried at fair value using adverse changes of   10 percent   and   20 percent   to the weighted average of certain significant assumptions used in valuing these assets: 

The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. To isolate the effect of the specified  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

change, the fair value shock analysis is consistent with the identified adverse change, while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change in one assumption generally impacts other assumptions, which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change. 
    
  See Note   17   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for further fair value disclosures relating to mortgage servicing rights. 
    
    Contractual servicing and subservicing fees  . Contractual servicing and subservicing fees, including late fees and other ancillary income are presented below. Contractual servicing fees are included within net (loss) return on mortgage servicing rights on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Contractual subservicing fees including late fees and other ancillary income are included within loan administration income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subservicing fee income is recorded for fees earned, net of third party subservicing costs, for loans subserviced.  
    
  The following table summarizes income and fees associated with contractual servicing rights: 

(1) 
    Servicing fees are recorded on the accrual basis. Ancillary income and late fees are recorded on a cash basis. 
              (2) 
    Includes a   $2 million   gain related to the sale of MSRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
              (3) 
    Changes in the derivatives utilized as economic hedges to offset changes in fair value of the MSRs. 
       
  The following table summarizes income and fees associated with our mortgage loans subserviced: 

(1) 
    Servicing fees are recorded on the accrual basis. Ancillary income and late fees are recorded on cash basis. 

Note   8     Derivative Financial Instruments  
    
  Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition after taking into account the effects of legally enforceable bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. We are exposed to non-performance risk by the counterparties to our various derivative financial instruments. We believe that the non-performance risk inherent in all our derivative contracts is minimal based on credit standards and the collateral provisions of the derivative agreements. A majority of our derivatives are centrally cleared through a Central Counterparty Clearing House or consist of residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments further limiting our exposure to non-performance risk. 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     We maintain a derivative portfolio of interest rate swaps, futures and forward commitments used to manage exposure to changes in interest rates, MSR asset values and to meet the needs of customers. We also enter into interest rate lock commitments, which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate. Market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held-for-sale is managed using corresponding forward sale commitments. 

23 

     Table of Contents  

Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
    Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:   We have designated certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of certain interest rate payments of our variable-rate Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  
    
  Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition and reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the hedge transaction is recognized in earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $37 million   (net-of-tax) recorded of unrealized losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), compared to   $3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The estimated amount to be reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings during the next 12 months represents   $7 million   of losses (net-of-tax).  
    
  Derivatives that are designated in hedging relationships are assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis at inception and throughout the hedge period. All hedge relationships were and are expected to be highly effective as of   September 30, 2016  . Cash flows and the profit impact associated with designated hedges are reported in the same category as the underlying hedged item. 
    
  The net gain (loss) recognized in income on derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting positions, were as follows:

We pledged a total of   $84 million   of cash collateral to counterparties and had an obligation to return cash of   $24 million   at   September 30, 2016   for derivative activities. We pledged a total of   $41 million   of cash collateral to counterparties and had an obligation to return cash of   $14 million   at   December 31, 2015   for derivative activities. The net cash pledged is restricted and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

Note   9     Debt 
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and other 
    
  The following is a breakdown of our Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other short-term debt outstanding: 

(1) 
    Includes short-term adjustable rate federal funds line of credit.  
              (2) 
    Other short-term debt consists of borrowings that settle through the Federal Reserve Bank. 
        
  We settled   $375 million   in long-term fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank advances during the fourth quarter 2015, which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $3 million  , included in other noninterest income. 
    
  We are required to maintain a minimum amount of qualifying collateral. In the event of default, the Federal Home Loan Bank advance is similar to a secured borrowing, whereby the Federal Home Loan Bank has the right to sell the pledged collateral to settle the fair value of the outstanding advances. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had the authority and approval from the Federal Home Loan Bank to utilize a line of credit of up to   $7.0 billion   and we may access that line to the extent that collateral is provided. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.5 billion   of advances outstanding and an additional   $2.0 billion   of collateralized borrowing capacity available at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The advances can be collateralized by non-delinquent single-family residential first mortgage loans, loans with government guarantees, certain other loans and investment securities.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.0 billion   of the outstanding advances were adjustable rate based on the   three  -month LIBOR index. Interest rates on these advances reset every   three   months and the advances may be prepaid without penalty, with notification at scheduled   three   month intervals after an initial   12   month lockout period.  
    
  The following table contains detailed information on our Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowings: 

27 

     Table of Contents  

The following outlines our Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other final maturity dates as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Senior Notes and Trust Preferred Securities 
    
  The following table presents long-term debt: 

Senior Notes  
    
  On July 11, 2016, we issued   $250 million   of senior notes ( 2021 Senior Notes ) which mature on July 15, 2021. The proceeds from these notes were used to bring current and redeem our outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. The notes are unsecured and rank equally and ratably with the unsecured senior indebtedness of Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. 
    
  Prior to June 15, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 0.50 percent, plus, in each case accrued and unpaid interest.   
    
  Trust Preferred Securities  
    
  We sponsor nine trust subsidiaries, which issued preferred stock to third party investors. We issued trust preferred securities to those trusts which we have included in long-term debt which are the sole assets of the trusts.  
    
  The trust preferred securities are callable by us at any time. Interest is payable quarterly; however, we may defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters without default or penalty. In January 2012, we exercised our contractual rights to defer interest payments. On July 14, 2016, we ended the deferral and made a   $34 million   payment to bring current our previously deferred interest as of that date.  
  
   28 

Table of Contents  

Note   10   - Representation and Warranty Reserve 
       
  At the time a loan is sold, an estimate of the fair value of the guarantee associated with the mortgage loans is recorded in the representation and warranty reserve in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition which reduces the net gain on loan sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subsequent to the sale, the liability is re-measured on an ongoing basis based on an estimate of probable losses. Changes in the estimate are recorded in the representation and warranty provision (benefit) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    
  The following table shows the activity impacting the representation and warranty reserve: 

Due to our sustained low level of charge-offs and a lower level of demands received, we have reduced our estimate of probable losses related to our representation and warranty liability as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  .  

Note   11     Warrants  
    
  May Investor Warrant 
    
    We granted warrants (the "May Investor Warrants") on January 30, 2009 under anti-dilution provisions applicable to certain investors (the "May Investors") in our May 2008 private placement capital raise.  
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   32,721   May Investor Warrants were exercised resulting in the issuance of   21,068   shares of Common Stock. The May Investors held warrants to purchase   583,240   shares at an exercise price of   $10.00   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The May Investor Warrants do not meet the definition of a contract that is indexed to our own stock under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the May Investor Warrants are classified as other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and are measured at fair value. Warrant liabilities are valued using a Black Scholes model and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Significant observable inputs include share price, expected volatility, a risk free rate and an expected life. The warrants are accounted for under the equity method.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the liability from May Investors Warrants amounted to   $10 million   and   $8 million  , respectively. See Note   17   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for further recurring fair value disclosures.  
    
  TARP Warrant  
    
    On January 30, 2009, in conjunction with the sale of   266,657   shares of Series C fixed rate cumulative non-convertible perpetual preferred stock ("Series C Preferred Stock"), we issued a warrant to purchase up to approximately   645,138   shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of   $62.00   per share (the "Warrant") for   $267 million  .  
    
  The Warrant is exercisable through 2019 and remains outstanding subsequent to the redemption of TARP, which occurred during the third quarter 2016.

Note   12   - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
    The following table sets forth the components in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for each type of investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities held-to-maturity, and cash flow hedges: 

Note   13     Earnings Per Share 
    
    Basic earnings per share, excluding dilution, is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that could then share in our earnings. 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock:    

On July 29, 2016, we completed the previously announced   $267 million   redemption of our Series C Preferred Stock. This transaction reduced stockholders equity by approximately   $372 million   with a     $267 million   reduction in Preferred Stock and a   $105 million   reduction related to the payment of deferred dividends. 

30 

     Table of Contents  

Under the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock the Company was able to defer payments of dividends. We elected to defer dividend payments beginning with the February 2012 dividend. Although, while being deferred, the impact was not included in quarterly net income from continuing operations, the deferral still impacted net income applicable to common stock for the purpose of calculating earnings per share, as shown above.  

N  ote   14     Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes in interim periods requires us to make a best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimated effective tax rate is then applied to interim consolidated pre-tax operating income to determine the interim provision for income taxes. 

We believe that it is unlikely that the unrecognized tax benefits will change by a material amount during the next   12 months  . We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes. 

Note   15     Regulatory Matters 
    
  Regulatory Capital 
    
    We, along with the Bank, must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2015, the Basel III rules became effective and include transition provisions through 2018.  
    
  To be categorized as "well-capitalized," the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum tangible capital, Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1, and total capital ratios as set forth in the table below. We, along with the Bank, are considered "well-capitalized" at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . There have been no conditions or events that management believes have changed our or the Bank s category. 
    
  The following table shows the regulatory capital ratios as of the dates indicated:

Note   16     Legal Proceedings, Contingencies and Commitments 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  We and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business operations. In addition, the Bank is routinely named in civil actions throughout the country by borrowers and former borrowers relating to the origination, purchase, sale, and servicing of mortgage loans. From time to time, governmental agencies also conduct investigations or examinations of various mortgage-related practices of the Bank. In the course of such investigations or examinations, the Bank cooperates with such agencies and provides information as requested. 
    
  We assess the liabilities and loss contingencies in connection with such pending or threatened legal and regulatory proceedings on at least a quarterly basis and establish accruals when we believe it is probable that a loss may be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, litigation accruals are adjusted, as appropriate, in light of additional information. 
    
  Management does not believe that the amount of any reasonably possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued with respect to ongoing proceedings or any other known claims will be material to our financial statements, or that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  DOJ litigation settlement 
    
    In 2012, the Bank entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") which meets the definition of a financial liability (the "DOJ Liability").  
  In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, we made an initial payment of   $15 million   and agreed to make future annual payments totaling   $118 million  . The Settlement Agreement provides that the Bank will make annual payments in increments of up to   $25 million   towards the   $118 million   still due upon meeting all conditions which are evaluated quarterly and include: (a) the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which occurred at the end of 2013; (b) the repayment of the Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the "TARP Preferred"), which occurred in the current quarter, (or, in the absence of repayment, adjusting our Bank Tier 1 Capital Ratio for any unextinguished TARP Preferred); (c) our Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio is   11 percent   or more. Additionally, if the Bank and Bancorp become party to a business combination in which the Bank or Bancorp represent less than   33.3 percent   of the resulting company s assets, such annual payments must commence twelve months after the date of that business combination.  
    
  Within six months of satisfying the conditions specified above, the Bank would make an additional payment, to occur no more frequently than annually, provided that doing so would not violate any material banking regulatory requirement or the OCC does not object in writing. Consistent with our business and regulatory requirements, Flagstar shall seek in good faith to  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

fulfill the conditions, and will not undertake any conduct or fail to take any action the purpose of which is to frustrate or delay our ability to fulfill any of the above conditions. 
    
  We elected to account for the DOJ Liability under the fair value option. To determine the fair value, we utilize a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions for the discounted cash flow model include using a discount rate as of   September 30, 2016   of   7.2 percent  ; probability weightings of multiple cash flow scenarios and possible outcomes which contemplate the above conditions and estimates of forecasted net income, size of the balance sheet, capital levels, dividends and their impact on the timing of cash payments and the assumptions we believe a market participant would make to transfer the liability. The fair value of the DOJ Liability was   $60 million   and   $84 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The lower value resulted from a change in the expectation as to the timing of payments to the DOJ as a result of a   $200 million   dividend from the Bank to the Bancorp and the issuance of   $250 million   in Senior Notes, both of which occurred in July 2016, to a) bring current the interest payments on our trust preferred securities, b) become current on our deferred interest and dividends related to our TARP Preferred and c) repay our TARP Preferred. To support the on-going debt service and other Bancorp expenses, we also intend to reduce our Bancorp double leverage and debt to equity ratios to be more consistent with such ratios at other mid-sized banks, which would likely require further dividend payments from the Bank to the Bancorp for the foreseeable future.  
    
  Other litigation accruals 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , excluding the fair value liability relating to the DOJ litigation settlement, our total accrual for contingent liabilities and settled litigation was   $6 million   and   $2 million  , respectively. 
    
  Commitments 
    
  A summary of the contractual amount of significant commitments is as follows: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend. Since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us, upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparties.  
    
  We enter into mortgage interest-rate lock commitments with our customers. These commitments are considered to be derivative instruments and changes in the fair value of these commitments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in other assets. Further discussion on derivative instruments is included in Note   8   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein. 
    
  We have unfunded commitments under our contractual arrangement with the HELOC borrowers. Commitments to extend, originate or purchase credit are primarily lines of credit to consumers and have specified rates and maturity dates. Many of these commitments also have adverse change clauses, which allow us to cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers  creditworthiness. 

33 

     Table of Contents  

Other consumer commitments are conditional commitments issued to accommodate the financial needs of customers. The commitments are under various terms to lend funds to consumers, which include revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements.  
    
  Warehouse loan commitments are lines of credit provided to mortgage originators to fund loans they originate and then sell. The proceeds of the sale of the loans are used to repay the draw on the line used to fund the loans.  
    
  Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, while commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party. 
    
  Commercial and industrial and other commercial commitments are conditional commitments issued under various terms to lend funds to business and other entities. These commitments include revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 
    
  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk beyond the amount recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Our exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. We utilize the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for balance sheet instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is not a violation of any condition established in the contract. 
    
  We maintain a reserve for the estimate of probable credit losses inherent in unfunded commitments to extend credit. Unfunded commitments to extend credit include unfunded loans with available balances, new commitments to lend that are not yet funded, and standby and commercial letters of credit. The balance of   $3 million   and   $2 million   for   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is reflected in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 

Note   17     Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We utilize fair value measurements to record or disclose the fair value on certain assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability through an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, we use present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments. These valuation models rely on market-based parameters when available, such as interest rate yield curves or credit spreads. Unobservable inputs may be based on management's judgment, assumptions and estimates related to credit quality, our future earnings, interest rates and other relevant inputs. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used. Refer to Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a description of our valuation methodologies and information about the fair value hierarchy.

Recurring Significant Unobservable Inputs 
    
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the second mortgage loans are discount rates, constant prepayment rates, and default rates. The constant prepayment and default rates are based on a 12 month historical average. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Increases (decreases) in prepay rates in isolation result in a higher (lower) fair value and increases (decreases) in default rates in isolation result in a lower (higher) fair value. 
    
  The HELOC loans are valued utilizing a loan-level discounted cash flow model which projects expected cash flows given three potential outcomes: (1) paid-in-full at scheduled maturity, (2) default at scheduled maturity (foreclosure), and (3) modification at scheduled maturity into an amortizing HELOC. Loans are placed into the potential outcome buckets based on their underlying current delinquency, FICO scores and property CLTV all of which are unobservable inputs. Estimated cash flows are then discounted back using an unobservable discount rate. Loans within the loan portfolios contain FICO scores with a minimum of   447  , maximum of   816  , and a weighted average of   665  . For the loans, increases (decreases) in the discount rate, in isolation, would lower (higher) the fair value measurement.  

39 

     Table of Contents  

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the MSRs are option adjusted spreads, prepayment rates, and cost to service. Significant increases (decreases) in all three assumptions in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Additionally, the key economic assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs capitalized during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   periods were as follows: 

The key economic assumptions reflected in the overall fair value of the entire portfolio of MSRs were as follows: 

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the DOJ litigation settlement is the discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate in isolation could result in a marginally lower (higher) fair value measurement. For further information on the fair value inputs related to the DOJ litigation, see Note   16   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein. 
    
  The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate. The pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values. New market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios (i.e., the inverse of the pull through rate) are applied accordingly. Significant increases (decreases) in the pull through rate in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
       
  We also have assets that under certain conditions are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are measured at the lower of cost or market and had a fair value below cost at the end of the period as summarized below: 

(2) 
    We recorded less than   $1 million   in fair value losses on loans held-for-sale for which we did not elect the fair value option (included in interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations) during both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to less than   $1 million   in fair value losses on loans held-for-sale during both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
              (3) 
    We recorded   $11 million   and   $31 million   in fair value losses on impaired loans (included in provision (benefit) for loan losses on Consolidated Statements of Operations) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $20 million   and   $76 million   in fair value losses on impaired loans during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
              (4) 
    We recorded   zero   and   $2 million   in losses related to write downs of repossessed assets based on the estimated fair value of the specific assets during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and recognized net gain of   $1 million   and   $2 million   on sales of repossessed assets (both write downs and net gains/losses are included in assets resolution expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We recorded   $1 million   and   $2 million   in losses related to write downs of repossessed assets based on the estimated fair value of the specific assets during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and recognized a net gain of   $1 million   and   $2 million   on sales of repossessed assets during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments that are carried either at fair value, cost, or amortized cost: 

42 

     Table of Contents  

The methods and assumptions used by us in estimating fair value of financial instruments which are required for disclosure only, are as follows: 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents.   Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. 
       
  Investment securities held-to-maturity.   Fair values are generated using market inputs, where possible, including quoted prices (the closing price in an exchange market), bid prices (the price at which a buyer stands ready to purchase), and other market information. 
    
    Loans with government guarantees.   The fair value is estimated by using internally developed discounted cash flow models using market interest rate inputs as well as management s best estimate of spreads for similar collateral. 
    
    Loans held-for-investment.   The fair value is estimated using internally developed discounted cash flow models using market interest rate inputs as well as management s best estimate of spreads for similar collateral. 
    
    Federal Home Loan Bank stock.   No secondary market exists for Federal Home Loan Bank stock. The stock is bought and sold at par by the Federal Home Loan Bank. Management believes that the recorded value equals the fair value. 
    
    Bank owned life insurance.   The fair value of bank owned life insurance policies is based on the cash surrender values of the policies as reported by the insurance companies. 
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

Other assets, foreclosure claims.   The fair value of foreclosure claims with government guarantees approximates the carrying amount. 
    
  Deposit accounts.   The fair value of deposits with no defined maturity is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model that incorporates current market rates for similar products and expected attrition. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for certificates of deposit with similar remaining maturities. 
       
    Federal Home Loan Bank advances.   Rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of the existing debt. 
    
    Long-term debt.   The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model that incorporates current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
    
  Fair Value Option  
    
  We elected the fair value option for certain items as discussed throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to mitigate a divergence between accounting losses and economic exposure. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued on the principal outstanding primarily using the "simple-interest" method. 
    
  The following table reflects the change in fair value included in earnings of financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected:

Note   18     Segment Information 
    
    Our operations are conducted through   four   operating segments: Mortgage Originations, Mortgage Servicing, Community Banking and Other, which includes the remaining reported activities. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activity from which revenues are earned and expenses incurred for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by executive management in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The operating segments have been determined based on the products and services offered and reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Each segment operates under the same banking charter, but is reported on a segmented basis for this report. Each of the operating segments is complementary to each other and because of the interrelationships of the segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized our reportable segments to align with our new management reporting structure and to align with our long-term strategy. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the current presentation. Prior to the reorganization, representation and warranty reserves were reported in the Mortgage Servicing segment and the MSR asset and associated costs were reported in the Other segment. As a result of this change, representation and warranty reserves, as well as the MSR asset and associated costs are now reported in the Mortgage Originations segment. 
    
  The Mortgage Originations segment originates, acquires and sells one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. The origination and acquisition of mortgage loans comprises the majority of the lending activity. Mortgage loans are originated through home loan centers, national call centers, the Internet and unaffiliated banks and mortgage banking and brokerage companies, where the net interest income and the gains from sales associated with these loans are recognized in the Mortgage Originations segment. 
    
  The Mortgage Servicing segment services and sub-services mortgage loans, on a fee basis, for others. Also, the Mortgage Servicing segment services, on a fee basis, residential mortgages held-for-investment by the Community Banking segment and mortgage servicing rights held by the Mortgage Originations segment. The Mortgage Servicing segment may also collect ancillary fees, such as late fees, and earns income through the use of noninterest-bearing escrows.  

45 

     Table of Contents  

The Community Banking segment originates loans, provides deposits and fee based services to consumer, business, and mortgage lending customers through its Branch Banking, Business Banking and Commercial Banking, Government Banking, Warehouse Lending and Held-for-Investment Portfolio groups. Products offered through these teams include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, consumer loans, commercial loans, home builder finance loans and warehouse lines of credit. Other financial services available to consumer and commercial customers include lines of credit, revolving credit, customized treasury management solutions, equipment leasing, inventory, and accounts receivable lending and capital markets services such as interest rate risk protection products. 
    
  The Other segment includes the treasury functions, funding revenue associated with stockholders' equity, the impact of interest rate risk management, the impact of balance sheet funding activities, and miscellaneous other expenses of a corporate nature. Treasury functions include administering the investment securities portfolios, balance sheet funding, and interest rate risk management. In addition, the Other segment includes revenue and expenses related to treasury and corporate assets and liabilities and equity not directly assigned or allocated to the Mortgage Originations, Mortgage Servicing or Community Banking operating segments. 
       
  Revenues are comprised of net interest income (before the provision (benefit) for loan losses) and noninterest income. Noninterest expenses are fully allocated to each operating segment. Allocation methodologies may be subject to periodic adjustment as the internal management accounting system is revised and the business or product lines within the segments change.

Note   19     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
    
    Statement of Cash Flows   -   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This amendment addresses eight issues which current GAAP does not include specific guidance or is unclear, pertaining to: Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs, Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments, Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination, Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims, Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned or Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies, Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees, Beneficial Interest in Securitization Transactions, and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating this guidance and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
    Credit Losses   -   In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU alters the current method for recognizing credit losses within the reserve account. Currently, an institution uses the incurred loss method, the new guidance will require the allowance to be recorded on day one for the contractual term of the financial asset. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
    Stock Compensation   -   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating this guidance and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives and Hedging   -   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-06 clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in ASU 2016-06 is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. ASU 2016-06 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact upon adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements, but disclosures to the Notes thereto will be updated per the requirements. 
       
    Leases   -   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Section A - Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Section B - Conforming Amendments Related to Leases: Amendment to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Section C - Background Information and Basis For Conclusions. Lessees will need to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes Topic 840, Leases. Management is currently evaluating this guidance and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
       
    Financial Instruments   -   In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new standard significantly revises an entity s accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating this guidance and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, if any. 
       
    Revenue from Contracts with Customers   -   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." Under the amended guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has voted to approve a year deferral of the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption. In April 2016, the FASB clarified the following two aspects: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, to provide a limited number of changes to its revenue recognition standard. The amendments clarify the assessment of the likelihood that revenue will be collected from a contract, the guidance for presenting sales taxes and similar taxes, and the timing for measuring customer payments that are not in cash. The amendment also says a contract should be considered complete if all, or substantially all, of its revenue has been collected prior to making the transition to the new standard. In addition, the update clarifies the disclosure requirements for businesses and other organizations that make the transition to the new standard by adjusting amounts from prior reporting periods. The effects have to be disclosed for prior periods that were adjusted. Management is currently evaluating this guidance and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; however, changes to disclosures in the Notes thereto will be required.

General  
    
    We are a Michigan-based savings and loan holding company founded in 1993. Our business is primarily conducted through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, a federally chartered stock savings bank founded in 1987. At   September 30, 2016  , based on our assets, we are one of the largest banks headquartered in Michigan, providing commercial, small business, and consumer banking services. We have three major operating segments: Community Banking, Mortgage Originations, and Mortgage Servicing. Through these lines of business, we emphasize the delivery of a complete set of mortgage and banking products and services and are distinguished by local delivery, customer service and product pricing. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "FBC." We are considered a controlled company for NYSE purposes, because MP Thrift Investments, L.P. ("MP Thrift") held approximately   62.9   percent of our common stock as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized our reportable segments to align with our new management reporting structure and to align with our long-term strategy. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to 2016 presentation. Prior to the reorganization, representation and warranty reserves were reported in the Mortgage Servicing segment and the MSR asset and associated costs were reported in the Other segment. As a result of this change, representation and warranty reserves, as well as the MSR asset and associated costs are now reported in the Mortgage Originations segment. 
       
  Our Community Banking segment provides deposits and fee based services to consumer, business, and mortgage lending customers through our Branch Banking, Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Government Banking, Warehouse Lending and Held-for-Investment Portfolio groups. We maintain a portfolio of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and builder finance loans with our commercial customers and we originate or purchase residential mortgage loans through referrals from our branches, consumer direct call center and our website, flagstar.com. At   September 30, 2016  , we operated   99   branches in Michigan. We leverage the customer relationships we have gained throughout our branch network to cross-sell products to existing customers and increase our customer base. In 2016, we also began to offer new MSR lending and equipment finance lease products. 
    
  Through our Mortgage Origination segment, we originate or purchase residential mortgage loans throughout the country and sell them into securitization pools, primarily to Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") (collectively, the "Agencies") or as whole loans. In addition, we originate or purchase residential first mortgage loans and other consumer loans, and commercial loans to our held-for-investment loan portfolios. Our revenues include net interest income, income from banking services we provide to customers, and noninterest income from sales of residential first mortgage loans to the Agencies, and the servicing of loans for others. The combination of our retail, broker and correspondent channels gives us broad access to customers across diverse geographies to originate, fulfill, sell and service our residential mortgage loan products. 
    
  The majority of our total loan originations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   represented mortgage loans that were collateralized by residential first mortgages on single-family residences and were eligible for sale to the Agencies. At   September 30, 2016  , we originated or purchased residential mortgage loans in all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia through relationships with   556   mortgage brokers and   729   correspondents. At   September 30, 2016  , we also operated   31   retail locations located in   21   states, which primarily originate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans as part of our Mortgage Originations segment. In addition, we originate other consumer and commercial loans through our Community Banking segment. We continue to expand existing business lines, such as our distributed retail and direct-to-consumer mortgage origination businesses.  
    
  Our Mortgage Servicing segment services and subservices mortgage loans for others on a fee for service basis and may also collect ancillary fees, such as late fees and earn income through the use of noninterest bearing escrows. Revenue on our subserviced loans is earned on a contractual fee basis, with the fees varying based on the status of the underlying loans. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   2,881   full-time equivalent employees inclusive of account executives and loan officers. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain accounting policies that, due to the judgment, estimates and assumptions in those policies are critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 1. Financial Statements herein. These policies relate to: (a) fair value measurements; (b) the determination of our allowance for loan losses; (c) the

accounting for income taxes; and (d) the determination of our representation and warranty reserve. We believe the judgment, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes, in Item 1, are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes, in Item 1, herein, to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments, estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations and/or financial condition. For further information on our critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which is available on our website, flagstar.com, under the Investor Relations section, or on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, at sec.gov.

Summary of Operations 

Our net income increased $10 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $28 million improvement in noninterest income, driven by higher net gain on loan sales, while a decrease in fair value of the DOJ settlement liability was offset by higher loss on mortgage servicing rights. The noninterest income improvement was primarily offset by higher performance driven expenses and provision for income taxes.  
    
  Net income increased $18 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by a $25 million increase in net interest income and $16 million increase in noninterest income partially offset by higher performance driven expenses and a lower benefit for loan losses. Net interest income increased as a result of asset growth and our strategic initiative to replace lower credit quality assets with higher quality residential and commercial loans. As a result of this initiative, we grew average interest earning assets by   19 percent   from   $10.2 billion   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $11.9 billion   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Within noninterest income, net gain on loan sales increased $17 million while a decrease in fair value of the DOJ settlement liability was offset by a higher loss on mortgage servicing rights driven by low interest rates which result in higher prepayments and a more competitive market.

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  Net interest income   in  creased   $7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to growth in interest earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in net interest margin driven by a lower interest rate environment. 
    
  Our net interest margin for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   2.58 percent  , compared to   2.75 percent   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease from 2015 was driven primarily by higher interest rates on fixed rate long term debt used to match-fund our longer duration asset growth and increased interest expense on senior debt issued in conjunction with the TARP redemption. 
    
  Interest income increased $15 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher average loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment partially offset by lower interest rates on loans held-for-sale. Average loans held-for-sale increased   $1.2 billion   or   55.3 percent   compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to slower deliveries of saleable mortgage loans to the Agencies during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Average loans held-for-investment for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , increased   $0.4 billion   or   8.1 percent  , compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to a continued shift in mix, consistent with our strategy, of $1.3 billion in average balance of high quality, higher yielding commercial loans and corresponding decrease of $0.8 billion in average balance of primarily lower yielding residential first mortgage loans. 
    
  Interest expense increased $8 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher interest rates from longer term fixed rate debt taken to match-fund our longer duration asset growth and interest expense as a result of the senior debt issued in conjunction with the TARP redemption. Also impacting the increase was a $383 million increase in interest-bearing deposits driven by growth in deposits which has been used to fund our loan growth. 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  Net interest income   in  creased   $25 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by continued growth in interest earning assets partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin driven by a lower interest rate environment and issuance of senior debt used for TARP redemption. 
    
  Our net interest margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   2.62 percent  , compared to   2.76 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven by higher interest rates from longer term fixed rate debt taken to match-fund our longer duration asset growth, interest expense on senior debt issued for TARP redemption and lower interest rate environment experience in 2016, partially offset from a rotation of lower spread residential mortgage loans into higher spread commercial loans. 
    
  Interest income increased $46 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher average loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment partially offset by lower interest rates. Average loans held-for-sale increased $1.0 billion for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in average volume, partially offset by a decrease in average yield resulting from a more competitive pricing market. Average loans held-for-investment increased $0.8 billion for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to growth in warehouse, commercial and HELOC loans, partially offset by a decrease in average yield from more competitive pricing in the residential and consumer markets. 
  Interest expense increased $21 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by an increase in the average balance and higher rates on debt to match-fund our longer duration asset growth. Also impacting the increase was a $4 million increase due to $372 million higher average interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 and a $4 million increase in interest expense as a result of the senior debt issued in conjunction with the TARP redemption.

Provision (Benefit) for Loan Losses 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  The provision (benefit) for loan losses was a provision of   $7 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a benefit of   $1 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   $7 million   provision was largely to reserve for repossessed loans with government guarantees. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the benefit for loan losses included charge-offs of $24 million and net originations of $5 million offset by a release of reserves of $30 million related to loan sales. 
       
  Net charge-offs for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   $7 million  , compared to   $24 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , net charge-offs included   $6 million   and zero of net charge-offs associated with loans with government guarantees, respectively. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net charge-offs included   $16 million   associated with the sale or transfer of   $233 million   unpaid principal balance of interest-only and non-agency loans. As a percentage of the average loans held-for-investment, net charge-offs for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   0.51 percent   from   1.84 percent   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the charge-offs associated with loan sales or transfers and loans with government guarantees, net charge-offs as a percentage of the average loans held-for-investment were   0.15 percent   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.61 percent   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  The provision (benefit) for loan losses was a benefit of   $9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to an   $18 million   benefit during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $9 million   benefit resulted primarily from the sale of   $1.2 billion   unpaid principal balance of performing residential first mortgage loans and   $110 million   of unpaid principal balance of nonperforming, TDR and non-agency loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the provision (benefit) for loan losses included a net reduction in the allowance for loan losses relating to several loan sales, including a net reduction in the allowance relating to interest-only residential first mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase related to the growth in average loans held-for-investment loan portfolio. 
    
  Net charge-offs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   $28 million  , compared to   $82 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net charge-offs included   $8 million   associated with the sale of   $110 million   unpaid principal balance of nonperforming, TDR and non-agency loans and   $13 million   of net charge-offs associated with loans with government guarantees. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net charge-offs included   $67 million   associated with the sale or transfer of interest-only residential first mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances totaling   $600 million  , along with   $420 million   of nonperforming, TDR and non-agency first mortgage loans. As a percentage of the average loans held-for-investment, net charge-offs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   0.66 percent   from   2.34 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the charge-offs associated with loan sales or transfers and loans with government guarantees, net charge-offs as a percentage of the average loans held-for-investment were   0.15 percent   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.43 percent   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  Total noninterest income was   $156 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was a   $28 million     in  crease from   $128 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Net gain on loan sales   in  creased   $26 million   to   $94 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $68 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   in  crease was primarily due to higher fallout-adjusted locks which increased to $8.3 billion during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.5 billion   in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   driven by a low interest rate environment in the third quarter of 2016. The fallout-adjusted net margin on mortgage rate lock commitments, excluding loans held-for-investment, increased 8 basis points to   1.13 percent   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.05 percent   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
           
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , loan fees and charges   in  creased   $5 million   to   $22 million  , as compared to   $17 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   in  crease in loan fees and charges during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily reflects higher mortgage loan closings. 
    
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , loan administration income   de  creased   $4 million   to   $4 million  , as compared to   $8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   de  crease was primarily due to a decrease in fees charged on loans serviced for others. 
    
  Net loss on mortgage servicing rights was   $11 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a return of   $12 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $23 million   decrease was primarily due to higher prepayments and higher prepayment assumptions resulting in changes in fair value related to sales including a $7 million change associated with pending MSR sales with a fair value of $50 million expected to close in the fourth quarter 2016.  
       
  Other noninterest income   in  creased   $27 million   to   $36 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   in  crease was almost entirely due to a   $24 million   reduction in the fair value of the Company's DOJ settlement liability. The reduction of the DOJ liability was a result of a change in the expectation as to the timing of payments.

  Total noninterest income was   $389 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was a   $16 million     in  crease from   $373 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Net gain on loan sales   in  creased   $17 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in 2015. The   in  crease was primarily due to higher fallout-adjusted lock volume and a $14 million gain resulting from the sale of performing loans held-for-investment, partially offset by lower margin. The fallout-adjusted net margin on mortgage rate lock commitments, excluding loans held-for-investment decreased 13 basis points to   1.05 percent   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.18 percent   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Loan fees and charges   in  creased   $3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $56 million  , as compared to   $53 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   in  crease is primarily due to higher mortgage loan closings. 
    
  Loan administration income   de  creased   $5 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $14 million  , as compared to   $19 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   de  crease was primarily due to a decrease in fee revenue from loans subserviced for others. 
       
  Net loss on mortgage servicing rights was   $21 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a return of   $19 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $40 million   decrease was primarily due to higher prepayments and a decrease in fair value driven by pending MSR sales. 
    
  Other noninterest income increased   $45 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the benefit related to the decrease in the fair value of the DOJ settlement liability, gain on sale of available-for-sale investment securities and income earned on our bank owned life insurance whose average balances increased along with lower adjustments related to assets and liabilities held at fair value.

Noninterest Expense 
    
    The following table sets forth the components of our noninterest expense: 

Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  Noninterest expense   in  creased   $11 million   to   $142 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $131 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   in  crease was primarily driven by investment in new strategic initiatives, higher stock compensation expense and increased business activity, primarily offset by a decrease in legal and professional expense. 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  Noninterest expense was   $418 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $407 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $25 million increase in compensation and benefits, and $9 million in commissions driven by investment in new strategic initiatives, higher stock compensation expense and increased business activity. This increase was partially offset by a $9 million decrease in federal insurance premiums due to an improvement in our risk profile along with a $7 million decrease in asset resolution expense primarily due to a decrease in default servicing and foreclosure costs and a $7 million decrease in legal and professional expense.  
    
  Other noninterest expense decreased $4 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by lower litigation settlement expenses. Additionally, in the second quarter 2016, we had a litigation settlement expense of $6 million related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit during the period which was offset by a favorable settlement with a vendor for which we were the plaintiff. 

Provision for Income Taxes   
    
  Our provision for income taxes for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $30 million   and   $73 million  , respectively, compared to a provision of   $24 million   and   $70 million   during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   34.3 percent   and   33.8 percent  , respectively, compared to   34.4 percent   and   36.0 percent   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The effective rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differs from the combined federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to benefits associated with state tax settlements and non-taxable bank owned life insurance earnings, partially offset by an increase in warrant expense and other nondeductible expenses.

OPERATING SEGMENTS 
    
  Overview 
    
  For detail on each segment's objectives, strategies, and priorities, please read this section in conjunction with Note   18   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, herein, for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized our reportable segments to align with our new management reporting structure and to align with our long-term strategy. All prior periods were reclassified to be consistent with the current presentation. Prior to the reorganization, representation and warranty reserves were reported in the Mortgage Servicing segment and the MSR asset and associated costs were reported in the Other segment. As a result of this change, representation and warranty reserves, as well as the MSR asset and associated costs are now reported in the Mortgage Originations segment. 
    
  The net income (loss) by operating segment is presented in the following table: 

Mortgage Originations 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  The Mortgage Originations segment net income decreased $5 million to   $60 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $65 million   in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a $23 million lower net return on MSRs resulting from increased runoff related to lower interest rates, primarily offset by a $24 million increase in net gain on loan sales resulting from a $1.5 billion increase in fallout-adjusted locks and a higher margin. 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  The Mortgage Originations segment reported net income of   $155 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net income of   $204 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily driven by $40 million lower net return on MSRs resulting from increased runoff related to lower interest rates and increased expectations for prepayments, as well as $7 million higher commissions related to higher mortgage originations.  
    
  Mortgage Servicing 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  The Mortgage Servicing segment reported a net loss of   $4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $10 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $6 million improvement was primarily due to a $6 million increase in interest income on company controlled deposits as a result of higher average balances and a decrease in loan processing expense. 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  The Mortgage Servicing segment reported a net loss of   $16 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $42 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $26 million improvement was primarily due to $13 million increase in interest income on company controlled deposits resulting from higher average balances, a $6 million decrease in asset resolution expense and a decrease in loan processing expense.

Community Banking 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Community Banking segment reported net income of   $10 million  , compared to   $13 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $3 million decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase of $10 million in net interest income due to growth in warehouse, commercial, and home builder finance loan balances, partially offset by a higher provision expense on higher loan balances and charge-offs.  
    
  Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Community Banking segment reported net income of   $52 million  , compared to   $29 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $23 million increase in net income was primarily due to a $24 million increase in net interest income resulting from growth in our warehouse, commercial, and home builder finance loan balances. In addition, we had a net gain on loan sales of $21 million which was primarily driven by the sale of performing residential first mortgage loans out of the held-for-investment portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were primarily offset by a $15 million increase in other noninterest expenses and a $9 million   increase in provision for loan losses. 
    
  Other 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
    
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Other segment net loss was   $9 million  , as compared to a net loss of   $21 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $12 million   improvement was primarily due to an increase in noninterest income due to a   $24 million   decrease in the fair value of the DOJ settlement liability, partially offset by an increase in interest expenses on higher average outstanding FHLB advances and senior debt issued for TARP redemption. 
    
  Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Other segment net loss was   $48 million   compared to   $66 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $18 million improvement was primarily due to an increase in noninterest income due to a   $24 million   decrease in the fair value of the DOJ settlement liability, primarily offset by higher average outstanding FHLB advances and senior debt issued for TARP redemption. 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
    
  Like all financial services companies, we engage in certain business activities and assume the related risks. The risks we are subject to, in the normal course of business, include, but are not limited to, credit, regulatory compliance, legal, reputation, liquidity, market, operational and strategic. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. We hold capital to protect from the risk of unexpected loss. 
    
  A comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, liquidity, market, operational and capital risks are described in the following paragraphs. 

Credit Risk 
    
  Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending.

Mortgage Originations 
    
    Our Mortgage Originations segment originates, acquires and sells one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We sell substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we produce into the secondary market on a whole loan basis or securitizing the loans into mortgage-backed securities with the Agencies. We utilize production channels to originate or acquire mortgage loans and each production channel originates mortgage loan products which are underwritten to the same standards. We expect to continue to leverage technology to streamline the mortgage origination process, thereby bringing service and convenience to brokers and correspondents. We also continue to make available to our customers various web-based tools that facilitate the mortgage loan origination process through each of our production channels. Brokers and correspondents are able to register and lock loans, check the status of inventory, deliver documents in electronic format, generate closing documents, and request funds through the Internet. Funding for our Mortgage Originations segment is provided primarily by deposits held in our Community Banking segment and borrowings.  
    
  Correspondent.   In a correspondent transaction, an unaffiliated bank or mortgage company completes the loan paperwork and also supplies the funding for the loan at closing. After the bank or mortgage company has funded the transaction, we purchase the loan at a market price. We perform a full review of each loan, whether purchased in bulk or not, purchasing only those that were originated in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. We have active correspondent relationships with   729   companies, including banks, credit unions and mortgage companies located in all 50 states. 
    
  Broker.   In a broker transaction, an unaffiliated bank or mortgage brokerage company completes several steps of the loan origination process including the loan paperwork, but the loans are underwritten on a loan-level basis to our underwriting standards and we supply the funding for the loan at closing (also known as "table funding") thereby becoming the lender of record. Currently, we have active broker relationships with   556   mortgage brokers, credit unions and mortgage brokerage companies located in all 50 states. 
    
  Retail.   Our retail channel combines two business lines, home lending and direct-to-consumer. In a home lending transaction, loans are originated through our nationwide network of stand-alone home loan centers. At   September 30, 2016  , we maintained   31   retail locations in   21   states. In a direct-to-consumer lending transaction, loans are originated through our Community Banking segment banking centers and from a national direct-to-consumer call center. When loans are originated on a retail basis, most aspects of the lending process are completed internally, including the origination documentation (inclusive of customer disclosures), as well as the funding of the transactions. Our centralized loan processing provides efficiencies and allows lending sales staff to focus on originations.   
    
  We are a leading national originator of mortgage loans based on our residential first mortgage loan originations. The following tables disclose residential first mortgage loan originations by channel, type and mix for each respective period:

Mortgage Servicing   
    
  The Mortgage Servicing segment services and subservices mortgage loans for others on a fee for service basis and may also collect ancillary fees and earn income through the use of noninterest bearing escrows. The Mortgage Servicing segment services residential mortgages for our own held-for-investment loan portfolio in the Community Banking segment for which it earns revenue via an intercompany service fee allocation. The segment also services and subservices loans for others, which primarily includes servicing Agency loans. Revenue for those serviced and subserviced loans is earned on a contractual fee basis, with the fees varying based on our responsibilities and the status of the underlying loans. 
    
  The following table presents the unpaid principal balance (net of write downs) of residential loans serviced and the number of accounts associated with those loans. We are a top 25 mortgage servicer in the nation. 

(1) 
    Includes loans held-for-investment (residential first mortgage, second mortgage, and HELOC), loans held-for-sale (residential first mortgage), loans with government guarantees and repossessed assets. 
              (2) 
    Does not include temporary short-term subservicing performed as a result of sales of servicing-released mortgage servicing rights. Includes repossessed assets. 

Loans held-for-investment  
    
  Loans held-for-investment decreased from   $6.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $6.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in performing residential first mortgage loans from loan sales of   $1.2 billion   unpaid principal balance resulting from a change in management's intent, partially offset by an increase in our higher spread, relationship-based commercial loan portfolio. 
    
  For further information relating to the concentration of credit of our loans held-for-investment, see Note   4   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein. 
    
    Residential first mortgage loans.   We originate or purchase various types of conforming and non-conforming fixed and adjustable rate loans underwritten using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing owner occupied and second home properties. The LTV requirements vary depending on occupancy, property type, loan amount, and FICO. Loans with LTVs exceeding 80 percent are required to obtain mortgage insurance. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the largest geographic concentrations of our residential first mortgage loans in our held-for-investment portfolio were in California, Michigan and Florida, which represented 54.3 percent of such loans outstanding.

              (5) 
    Primarily Option ARMs.  
       
    Adjustable-rate mortgage loans.   Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans held-for-investment were originated using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines as a base framework, and the debt-to-income ratio guidelines and documentation typically followed the automated underwriting system guidelines. Our underwriting guidelines were designed with the intent to minimize layered risk. The maximum ratios allowable for purposes of both the LTV ratio and the combined loan-to-value ("CLTV") ratio, which includes second mortgages on the same collateral, was 95 percent, but subordinate (or second mortgage) financing was not allowed over a 95 percent LTV ratio. At a 95 percent LTV ratio with private mortgage insurance, the minimum acceptable FICO score, or the "floor," was 620, and at lower LTV ratio levels, the FICO floor was also 620. 
       
  Set forth below as of   September 30, 2016  , are the amounts of the ARM loans in our held-for-investment loan portfolio with interest rate reset dates in the periods noted. As noted in the above table, loans may reset more than once over a three-year period and nonperforming loans do not reset while in the nonperforming status. Accordingly, the table below may include the same loans in more than one period. In addition, the table below excludes purchased loan portfolios.

Second mortgage loans.   The majority of second mortgages we currently originate are closed in conjunction with the closing of the residential first mortgages originated by us. We generally require the same levels of documentation and ratios as with our residential first mortgages. Our current allowable debt-to-income ratio for approval of second mortgages is capped at 43 percent. We currently limit the maximum CLTV to 80 percent and FICO scores to a minimum of 680. Current fixed rate loans are available with terms up to 15 years. The second mortgage loans require full documentation and are underwritten and priced to ensure high credit quality and loan profitability. 
    
    Home Equity Line of Credit loans.   Underwriting guidelines for our HELOC originations have been established to attract higher credit quality loans with long-term profitability. The minimum FICO is 680, maximum CLTV up to 89 percent, and the maximum debt-to-income ratio is 43 percent. HELOCs are adjustable-rate loans that generally contain a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortizing period. We also offer HELOC loans for a term period of five to 15 years to repay. The minimum FICO is 680, maximum CLTV up to 89 percent, and the maximum debt-to-income ratio is 43 percent. Included in HELOC loans are interest-only loans. At   September 30, 2016  , the unpaid principal balance of our interest-only mortgage loans was   $70 million  .  
       
  Commercial loans held-for-investment.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we have continued to grow our longer term commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Our Business and Commercial Banking group includes relationships with relationship managers primarily throughout Michigan's major markets. Our commercial loans held-for-investment totaled   $3.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $2.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The portfolio consists of three loan types: commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and warehouse loans, each of which is discussed in more detail below. 
  
   71 

     Table of Contents  

The following table identifies the commercial loans held-for-investment portfolio by loan type and selected criteria at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Commercial real estate loans.   Our commercial real estate held-for-investment loan portfolio is comprised of loans that are collateralized by real estate properties intended to be income-producing in the normal course of business. This portfolio also includes owner occupied real estate loans, in addition to secured home builder loans.

     Table of Contents  

The following table discloses our total unpaid principal balance (net of write downs) of commercial real estate held-for-investment loans by borrower geographic concentration and collateral type at   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Unpaid principal balance, net of write downs, does not include premiums or discounts. 
     Includes   $252 million   of commercial owner occupied real estate loans at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
    Commercial and industrial loans.   Commercial and industrial held-for-investment loan facilities typically include lines of credit and term loans to small and middle market businesses for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, and expansion projects. Most of our commercial and industrial loans earn interest at a variable rate and we offer our customers the ability to enter into interest rate swaps for which we offset our risk by entering into offsetting market trades.  
       
  Warehouse lending.   We also offer warehouse lines of credit to other mortgage lenders. These allow the lender to fund the closing of residential first mortgage loans. Each extension or draw-down on the line is collateralized by mortgage loans being funded and is paid off once the underlying loan is sold to an outside investor which may be ourselves. Underlying mortgage loans are predominately originated using the agencies' underwriting standards. We believe we are increasing market share in the warehouse lending market through our strategic initiative to increase lending to customers who originate loans they then sell to outside third party investors. The aggregate committed amount of adjustable rate warehouse lines of credit granted to other mortgage lenders at   September 30, 2016   was   $2.7 billion  , of which   $1.8 billion   was outstanding, compared to   $2.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , of which   $1.3 billion   was outstanding. 

Credit Quality 
    
    Management considers a number of qualitative and quantitative factors in assessing the level of our allowance for loan losses. See the section captioned "Allowance for Loan Losses" in this discussion. As illustrated in the following tables, trends in certain credit quality characteristics such as nonperforming loans and past due statistics continue to show improvement. This is predominantly a result of the nonperforming and TDR loan sales, as well as run off of the legacy portfolios and the addition of new loans with strong credit characteristics to the held-for-investment portfolio.

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth certain information about our nonperforming assets as of the end of each of the last five quarters: 
    
  NONPERFORMING LOANS AND ASSETS 

(2) 
    Excludes loans carried under the fair value option. 
       
  Past due loans held-for-investment 
    
  For all portfolios within the consumer and commercial loan portfolio, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due (or nonperforming), or earlier when we become aware of information indicating that collection of principal and interest is in doubt. While it is the goal of management to collect on loans, we attempt to work out a satisfactory repayment schedule or modification with past due borrowers and will undertake foreclosure proceedings if the delinquency is not satisfactorily resolved. Our practices regarding past due loans are designed to both assist borrowers in meeting their contractual obligations and minimize losses incurred by the Bank. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued interest income is reversed. Loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $48 million   of past due loans held-for-investment. Of those past due loans,   $40 million   were nonperforming. At   December 31, 2015  , we had   $80 million   of past due loans held-for-investment. Of those past due loans,   $66 million   were nonperforming. The decrease from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to improved asset quality and the sale of nonperforming residential first mortgage loans. 
    
  Consumer loans.   As of   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming consumer loans decreased from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the sale of nonperforming residential first mortgage loans. Net charge-offs in consumer loans totaled   $7 million   and   $28 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $21 million   and   $81 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily due to the charge-offs of   $8 million   and   $67 million   related to the sale or transfer of loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Commercial loans.   As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   nonperforming commercial loans, compared to   $2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . There were   no   net charge-offs in commercial loans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to recoveries of   $2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

The following table sets forth information regarding past due loans held-for-investment at the dates listed:  

(1) 
    Includes performing nonaccrual loans that are less than 90 days delinquent and for which interest cannot be accrued. 
       
  The $32 million decrease in total past due loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily due to improved asset quality coupled with the sale of $20 million of nonperforming residential first mortgage loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The 30 to 59 days past due loans decreased to   $6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10 million   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily driven by improved asset quality.

Troubled debt restructurings (held-for-investment) 
    
  The following table provides a summary of TDRs by performing status: 

(1) 
    Consumer loans include: residential first mortgage, second mortgage, HELOC and other consumer loans. The allowance for loan losses on consumer TDR loans totaled   $11 million   and   $15 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (2) 
    Commercial loans include: commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and warehouse loans. 
          
  Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are modified loans in which a borrower demonstrates financial difficulties and for which a concession has been granted. The decrease of $48 million in our total TDR loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily due to the sale of TDR loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Nonperforming TDRs were   42.5 percent   and   53.4 percent   of total nonperforming loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Nonperforming TDRs are included in nonaccrual loans. TDRs remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of payments under the modified terms. Performing TDRs are excluded from nonaccrual loans because it is reasonably assured that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected. Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential first mortgage TDRs were 35 percent of residential first mortgage nonperforming loans at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 51 percent at   December 31, 2015  .

Allowance for Loan Losses    
    
  The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses that are inherent in our loans held-for-investment portfolio but which have not yet been realized. The consumer loan portfolio includes residential first mortgages, second mortgages, HELOC, and other consumer loans. The commercial loan portfolio includes commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and warehouse lending. See Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  
    
  The allowance for loan losses decreased $44 million to   $143 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $187 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease from   December 31, 2015   was primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of residential first mortgage loans as a result of sales along with the sale of   $110 million   unpaid principal balance of nonperforming, TDR and non-agency loans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans held-for-investment decreased to   2.3 percent   as of   September 30, 2016   from   3.0 percent   as of   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had a   3.8 percent   allowance coverage of our consumer loan portfolio. The commercial loan allowance for loan losses coverage ratio was   1.3 percent   at   September 30, 2016  , reflecting the percentage of warehouse loans in the portfolio and improved level of overall quality.

Liquidity Risk 
    
  Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not have sufficient funds to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects our ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate and market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet current financial obligations is a function of the balance sheet structure, the ability to liquidate assets, and access to various sources of funds. 
       
  We primarily originate Agency-eligible loans held-for-sale and therefore the majority of new residential first mortgage loan originations are readily convertible to cash, either by selling them as part of our monthly Agency sales, private party whole loan sales, or by pledging them to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and borrowing against them. We use the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis as a significant source for funding our residential mortgage banking business due to our flexibility in terms of being able to borrow or repay borrowings as daily cash needs require. 
    
  Our principal uses of funds include loan originations and operating expenses. At   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding rate-lock commitments of   $6.5 billion  , compared to   $3.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in rate-lock commitments was driven by the lower interest rate environment at   September 30, 2016  . Total commitments were   $9.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $5.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . See Note   16   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on commitments. 
    
  The amount we can borrow, or the value we receive for the assets pledged to our liquidity providers, varies based on the amount and type of pledged collateral as well as the perceived market value of the assets and the "haircut" of the market value of the assets. That value is sensitive to the pricing and policies of our liquidity providers and can change with little or no notice. 
    
  In addition to operating expenses at a particular level of mortgage originations, our cash flows are fairly predictable and relate primarily to the funding of cash outflows to originate or purchase residential first mortgages and cash inflows from sales of those residential first mortgages. Our mortgage warehouse funding line of business also generates cash flows as funds are extended to correspondent relationships to close new loans. Those loans are repaid when the correspondent sells the loan. Other material cash flows relate to growing our commercial lines of business and the loans we service for others and consist primarily of monthly principal, interest, taxes and insurance escrow payments.  
    
  Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows shows cash used in operating activities of   $10.1 billion   and   $7.1 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This primarily reflects our mortgage operations and is a reflection of the manner in which we execute certain loan sales for which the cash outflow is included in operating activities and the corresponding cash inflow is included in the investing section. 
    
  As governed and defined by our internal liquidity policy, we maintain adequate excess liquidity levels appropriate to cover unanticipated liquidity needs. In addition to this liquidity, we also maintain targeted minimum levels of unused collateralized borrowing capacity as another cushion against unexpected liquidity needs. Each business day, we forecast 90 days of daily cash needs. This allows us to determine our projected near term daily cash fluctuations and also to plan and adjust, if necessary, future activities. As a result, in an adverse environment, we would be able to make adjustments to operations as required to meet the liquidity needs of our business, including adjusting deposit rates to increase deposits, planning for additional Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, accelerating sales of loans held-for-sale (agencies and/or private), selling loans held-for-investment or securities, borrowing through the use of repurchase agreements, reducing originations, making changes to warehouse funding facilities, or borrowing from the discount window.     
    
  Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. 
    
  Parent Company Liquidity 
    
  The Company obtains its liquidity from multiple sources, including dividends from the Bank and the issuance of debt and equity securities. The primary uses of the Company's liquidity are debt service, dividends to common and preferred stockholders, capital contributions to the Bank and operating expenses. The Company's most liquid assets are cash it holds at the Bank and interest-bearing demand accounts at correspondent banks, all of which totaled $73 million at   September 30, 2016  .

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") regulates all capital distributions made by the Bank, directly or indirectly, to the holding company, including dividend payments. A subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice or application with the OCC at least 30 days prior to each proposed capital distribution. Whether an application is required is based on a number of factors including whether the institution qualifies for expedited treatment under the OCC rules and regulations or if the total amount of all capital distributions (including each proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. Under the Consent Order, the Bank may not pay a dividend or make a capital distribution if it is not in compliance with its approved capital plan or would not remain in compliance after making the dividend or capital distribution, and the Bank must receive OCC approval under the generally applicable application or notice requirements. In addition, as a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, the Bank must receive approval from the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") before declaring any dividends. Additional restrictions on dividends apply if the Bank fails the Qualified Thrift Lending ("QTL") test. We anticipate that as long as we remain under the consent order, we will be required to obtain approval from the OCC prior to any capital distribution. 
    
  For additional details and restrictions related to the Bank s payment of dividends, refer to the Capital section of Management s discussion and analysis within this form 10-Q.  

Deposits    
    
  Our deposits consist of three primary categories: retail deposits, government deposits, and company controlled deposits. Total deposits increased   $1.4 billion  , or   18 percent   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to increases in company controlled deposits. 
    
  We have continued to focus on increasing our core deposit accounts such as branch and commercial demand deposits, savings and money market accounts. These core deposits provide a lower cost funding source to the Bank. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our core deposits increased   $196 million   primarily driven by growth in commercial demand deposits, partially offset by a decline in retail money market demand accounts.  
    
  We utilize local governmental agencies, and other public units, as an additional source for deposit funding. These deposit accounts include   $372 million   of certificates of deposit with maturities typically less than one year and   $804 million   in checking and savings accounts at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Company controlled deposits arise due to our servicing of loans for others and represent the portion of the investor custodial accounts on deposit with the Bank. Certain deposits require us to reimburse the owner for the spread on these funds. This cost is a component of net loan administration income. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , these deposits increased   $869 million  , primarily due to taxes not yet paid out. 
    
  We participate in the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") program, through which certain customer certificates of deposit ("CD") are exchanged for CDs of similar amounts from other participating banks. This gives customers the potential to receive FDIC insurance up to $50 million. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $249 million   of total CDs enrolled in the CDARS program.

    These accounts represent a portion of the investor custodial accounts and escrows controlled by us in connection with loans serviced, or subserviced for others and that have been placed on deposit with the Bank. 

Borrowings    
    
  The Federal Home Loan Bank provides loans, also referred to as advances, on a fully collateralized basis, to savings banks and other member financial institutions. We are currently authorized through a resolution of our board of directors to apply for advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank using approved loan types as collateral. At   September 30, 2016  , we had the authority and approval from the Federal Home Loan Bank to utilize a line of credit of up to   $7.0 billion   and we may access that line to the extent that collateral is provided. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.5 billion   of advances outstanding and an additional   $2.0 billion   of collateralized borrowing capacity available at the Federal Home Loan Bank.  
    
  We have arrangements with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to borrow, as appropriate, from its discount window. The discount window is a borrowing facility that is intended to be used only for short-term liquidity needs arising from special or unusual circumstances. The amount we are allowed to borrow is based on the lendable value of the collateral that we provide. To collateralize the line, we pledge commercial and industrial loans that are eligible based on Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago guidelines. At   September 30, 2016  , we had pledged commercial and industrial loans amounting to $517 million with a lendable value of $508 million. At   December 31, 2015  , we had pledged commercial and industrial loans amounting to $75 million with a lendable value of $45 million. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no borrowings outstanding against this line of credit. We also have access to overnight borrowings from various counterparty banks that settle through the Federal Reserve Bank. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had $20 million and no borrowings outstanding on these short-term borrowings, respectively. 
    
    Federal Home Loan Bank advances.   Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased   $1,079 million   to   $2,462 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $3,541 million   at   December 31, 2015  . We rely upon advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank  
  
   82 

     Table of Contents  

as a source of funding for the origination or purchase of loans for sale in the secondary market and for providing duration specific short-term and long-term financing. The outstanding balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances fluctuates from time to time depending on our current inventory of mortgage loans held-for-sale and the availability of lower cost funding sources. Our portfolio includes short-term fixed and variable rate advances, long-term LIBOR adjustable advances, and long-term fixed rate advances. Interest rates on the LIBOR index advances reset every three-months and the advances may be prepaid without penalty, with notification, at scheduled three-month intervals after an initial 12-month lockout period.  
    
  Debt.   As part of our overall capital strategy, we previously raised capital through the issuance of junior subordinated notes to our special purpose trusts formed for the offerings, which issued preferred stock (trust preferred securities). The junior subordinated notes are callable by us at any time. Interest is payable on a quarterly basis; however, we may defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters without default or penalty. In January, 2012, we exercised our contractual right to defer regularly scheduled quarterly payments of interest. On July 14, 2016, we ended the deferral and made a   $34 million   payment to bring current our previously deferred interest as of that date.  
    
  We issued   $250 million   of 2021 senior notes on July 11, 2016 ( 2021 Senior Notes ). The proceeds from these notes were used to bring current and redeem our outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. The notes will be effectively subordinated to Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. s secured indebtedness. 
    
  Prior to June 15, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest.   
    
  See Note   9   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information about Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other long-term debt.  

Market Risk 
    
  Market risk is the risk of reduced earnings and or declines in the net market value of the balance sheet primarily due to changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or equity prices. We do not have any material foreign currency exchange risk or equity price risk. The primary market risk is interest rate risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of our assets and liabilities, changes in the relationships between rate indices, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. 
    
  Interest rate risk is monitored by the asset liability committee ("ALCO"), which is composed of our executive officers and other members of management, in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the ALCO considers the impact projected interest rate scenarios have on earnings and capital, liquidity, business strategies, and other factors. The ALCO meets monthly or as deemed necessary to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and fair values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activity, loans held-for-sale and commitments to originate loans, and the maturities of investments, borrowings and time deposits. 
    
  Financial instruments used to manage interest rate risk include derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward sales commitments. Further discussion of the use of and the accounting for derivative instruments is included in Notes   8   and   17   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our derivatives are accounted for at fair market value. All mortgage loan production originated for sale is accounted for on a fair value basis. 
    
  To effectively measure and manage interest rate risk, sensitivity analysis is used to determine the impact on earnings and the net market value of the balance sheet across various interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends, and strategies. From these simulations, interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented. Additionally, duration and net interest income sensitivity measures are utilized when they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process. The overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by executive management and the board of directors on an ongoing basis. However, management has the latitude to increase interest rate sensitivity within certain limits if, in management's judgment, the increase will enhance profitability. 
    
  Net interest income simulation analysis provides estimated net interest income of the current balance sheet across alternative interest rate scenarios. The net interest income analysis measures the sensitivity of interest sensitive earnings over a 12 month time horizon. The analysis holds the current balance sheet values constant and does not take into account management intervention. The net interest income simulation demonstrates the level of interest rate risk inherent in the existing balance sheet. 
  
   83 

     Table of Contents  

The following table is a summary of the changes in our net interest income that are projected to result from hypothetical changes in market interest rates. The interest rate scenarios presented in the table include interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and adjusted by instantaneous parallel rate changes plus or minus 200 basis points. The minus 200 basis point shock scenario is a flattener scenario as rates are floored at zero given the current interest rate levels. 

At   September 30, 2016  , the $2 million decline in the net interest margin in the constant scenario as compared to   December 31, 2015  , was primarily driven by a decreased yield on other investments and consumer loans. 
    
  We have also projected the potential impact to net interest income in a hypothetical "bear flattener" interest rate scenario as of   September 30, 2016  . When increasing short-term interest rates instantaneously by 100 basis points and holding the longer term interest rates unchanged, the decrease to net interest income over a 12-month and 24-month period based on our forecasted balance sheet is a loss of $21 million and $27 million, respectively.  
    
  In the net interest income simulation, our balance sheet exhibits slight asset sensitivity. When interest rates rise our interest income increases, conversely when interest rates fall our interest income decreases. The net interest income simulation measures the interest rate risk of the balance sheet over a short period of time, typically 12 months. An additional analysis is completed that measures the interest rate risk over an extended period of time. The Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") analysis provides a fair value of the balance sheet in alternative interest rate scenarios. The EVE analysis does not take into account management intervention and assumes the new rate environment is constant and the change is instantaneous. 
    
  The following table is a summary of the changes in our EVE that are projected to result from hypothetical changes in market interest rates. EVE is the market value of assets, less the market value of liabilities, adjusted for the market value of off-balance sheet instruments. The interest rate scenarios presented in the table include interest rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and as adjusted by instantaneous parallel rate changes upward to 300 basis points and downward to 100 basis points. The scenarios are not comparable due to differences in the interest rate environments, including the absolute level of rates and the shape of the yield curve. Each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment, repricing, and reinvestment assumptions. Management derives these assumptions by considering published market prepayment expectations, the repricing characteristics of individual instruments or groups of similar instruments, our historical experience, and our asset and liability management strategy. Further, this analysis assumes that certain instruments would not be affected by the changes in interest rates or would be partially affected due to the characteristics of the instruments. 
    
  Further, as this framework evaluates risks to the current statement of financial condition only, changes to the volumes and pricing of new business opportunities that can be expected in the different interest rate outcomes are not incorporated in this analytical framework. For instance, analysis of our history suggests that declining interest rate levels are associated with higher loan production volumes at higher levels of profitability. While this "natural business hedge" historically offsets most, if not all, of the identified risks associated with declining interest rate scenarios, these factors fall outside of the EVE framework. Further, there can be no assurance that this natural business hedge would positively affect the economic value of equity in the same manner and to the same extent as in the past. 
    
  There are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. It is not possible to fully model the market risk in instruments with leverage, option, or prepayment risks. Also, we are affected by basis risk, which is the difference in repricing characteristics of similar term rate indices. As such, this analysis is not intended to be a precise forecast of the effect a change in market interest rates would have on us.

If EVE increases in any interest rate scenario, that would indicate an increasing direction for the margin in that hypothetical rate scenario. A perfectly matched balance sheet would possess no change in the EVE, no matter what the rate scenario. The following table presents the EVE in the stated interest rate scenarios: 

Our balance sheet exhibits sensitivity in a rising interest rate scenario as the EVE decreases. The decrease in EVE is the result of the amount of liabilities that would be expected to reprice exceeding the amount of assets repriced in the up to 200 scenario. The (100) is a flattener scenario as shorter term rates are unable to decrease 100 basis points due to the absolute level of rates. Therefore, the yields of the longer term variable rate assets decrease by the full 100 basis points, but the liabilities repricing to shorter term rates decrease to less than 100 basis points, leading to a reduction in EVE. 

Mortgage servicing rights 
    
     At   September 30, 2016  , MSRs at fair value increased   $6 million   to   $302 million  , compared to   $296 million   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to additions from loan sales where we retained servicing, partially offset by actual and pending MSR sales and higher prepayments. 
       
  Once fully phased in, the Basel III capital rules will significantly reduce the allowable amount of the fair value of MSRs included in Tier 1 capital. Our ratio of MSRs to Tier 1 capital was   24.6 percent   and   20.6 percent   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we have pending MSR sales with a fair value of $50 million expected to close in the fourth quarter 2016. These sales represent nearly all of the Company's remaining Ginnie Mae MSRs and will significantly reduce the mortgage servicing asset as we work to prepare for Basel III final phase-in capital requirements as discussed above. 
    
  The principal balance of the loans underlying our total MSRs was   $31.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $26.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily attributable to an increase in servicing loan volume, partially offset by loan payoffs and MSR sales of $12.7 billion in underlying loans. 
    
  For further information relating to the mortgage servicing rights, see Note   7   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein. 

Operational Risk 
    
  Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error; inadequate or failed internal systems and controls; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. We evaluate internal systems, processes, and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational and fraud losses, and enhance our overall performance. 

Loans with government guarantees  
    
  The amount of loans with government guarantees totaled   $404 million   at   September 30, 2016   and the loans which we have not yet repurchased but had the unilateral right to repurchase totaled   $21 million   and were classified as loans with government guarantees. At   December 31, 2015  , loans with government guarantees totaled   $485 million   and those loans which we had not yet repurchased but had the unilateral right to repurchase totaled   $9 million   and were classified as loans with government guarantees. The balance of this portfolio decreased at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to loans with government guarantees transferred to held-for-sale and loan liquidations, partially offset by an increase in repurchased loans.

Substantially all of these loans continue to be insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and management believes that the reimbursement process is proceeding appropriately. These repurchased loans earn interest at a statutory rate, which varies for each loan, but is based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate at the time the loan becomes greater than 60 days delinquent. Certain loans within our portfolio may be subject to indemnifications and insurance limits which exposes us to limited credit risk. We have reserved for these risks within other assets and as a component of our allowance for loan losses on residential first mortgages. 
    
  For further information on loans with government guarantees, see Note   5   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, herein. 

Representation and warranty reserve  
    
  When we sell mortgage loans, we make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers, including sponsored securitization trusts and their insurers (primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had $14 million in Fannie Mae new repurchase demands and $10 million in Freddie Mac new repurchase demands. These amounts are down as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   when we had $75 million in Fannie Mae new repurchase demands and $23 million in Freddie Mac new repurchase demands.  

The following table summarizes the trends with respect to key model attributes and assumptions for estimating the representation and warranty reserve: 

(1) 
    Includes original unpaid principal balance of 2009 and later vintage loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Estimated losses from expected repurchases to be made (post appeal loss). 
       
  See Note   10   of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Capital       
    
  Under the capital distribution regulations, a savings bank that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company must either notify or seek approval from the OCC of a capital distribution at least 30 days prior to the declaration of a dividend or the approval by the board of directors of the proposed capital distribution. The 30-day period allows the OCC to determine whether the distribution would not be advisable. Because we are under the Consent Order, we currently must seek approval from the OCC prior to making a capital distribution from the Bank. Also, under Federal Reserve requirements, the Bank must provide a 30-day notice to the Federal Reserve prior to declaring or paying dividends. In addition, under the Supervisory Agreement, the Company agreed to request prior non-objection of the Federal Reserve to pay dividends or other capital distributions. We seek to manage our capital levels and overall business in a manner which we consider to be prudent and work with our regulators to ensure that our capital levels are appropriate considering our risk profile and evaluation of the capital levels maintained by peer institutions. 

Consent Orders 
    
    Effective October 23, 2012, the Bank's board of directors executed a Stipulation and Consent (the "Stipulation"), accepting the issuance of a Consent Order (the "Consent Order") by the OCC. The Consent Order replaced the supervisory agreement entered into between the Bank and the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS") on January 27, 2010, which the OCC terminated simultaneous with issuance of the Consent Order. For further information and a complete description of all of the terms of the Consent Order, please refer to the copy of the Consent Order filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 24, 2012. 
    
  On September 29, 2014, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"). The Consent Order relates to alleged violations of federal consumer financial laws arising from the Bank s residential  
  
   86 

     Table of Contents  

first mortgage loan loss mitigation practices and default servicing operations dating back to 2011. Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Bank paid $28 million for borrower remediation and $10 million in civil money penalties. The settlement does not involve any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Bank or our employees, directors, officers, or agents. For further information and a complete description of all of the terms of the Consent Order, please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 29, 2014. 
    
  Supervisory Agreement 
    
  On January 28, 2010, we became subject to the Supervisory Agreement, which will remain in effect until terminated, modified, or suspended in writing by the Federal Reserve. The failure to comply with the Supervisory Agreement could result in the initiation of further enforcement action by the Federal Reserve, including the imposition of further operating restrictions, and could result in additional enforcement actions against us. We have taken actions which we believe are appropriate to comply with, and intend to maintain compliance with, all of the requirements of the Supervisory Agreement. For further information and a complete description of all of the terms of the Supervisory Agreement, please refer to the copy of the Supervisory Agreement filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 28, 2010. 
    
  Department of Justice Settlement Agreement 
    
  On February 24, 2012, the Bank entered into a Settlement Agreement with the Department of Justice ("DOJ") under which we made an initial payment of $15 million and agreed to make future payments totaling   $118 million   in annual increments of up to $25 million upon meeting all of the following conditions which are evaluated quarterly and include: (a) the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which occurred at the end of 2013; (b) the repayment of the Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the "TARP Preferred") (or, in the absence of a redemption, adjusting our Bank Tier 1 Capital Ratio for any unextinguished TARP Preferred); and (c) our Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio is 11 percent or more. Additionally, if the Bank or Bancorp become party to a business combination in which the Bank or Bancorp represent less than 33.3 percent of the resulting company s assets, annual payments would commence twelve months after the date of that business combination. Further, should all conditions for payment be satisfied, an annual payment under the settlement agreement would be made, and any further payments would be made only so long as such conditions are satisfied at the time required for such further payments. 
    
  Within six months of satisfying the conditions specified above, the Bank would make an additional payment, to occur no more frequently than annually, provided that doing so would not violate any material banking regulatory requirement or the OCC does not object in writing. Consistent with our business and regulatory requirements, Flagstar shall seek in good faith to fulfill the conditions, and will not undertake any conduct or fail to take any action the purpose of which is to frustrate or delay our ability to fulfill any of the conditions. 
    
  In July 2016, we paid a $200 million dividend from the Bank to the Bancorp and issued $250 million in Senior Notes to a) bring current the interest payments on our trust preferred securities, b) become current on our deferred interest and dividends related to our TARP Preferred and c) repay our TARP Preferred. To support the on-going debt service and other Bancorp expenses, we also intend to reduce our Bancorp double leverage and debt to equity ratios to be more consistent with such ratios at other mid-sized banks, which would likely require further dividend payments from the Bank to the Bancorp for the foreseeable future.  
    
  Future annual payments of $25 million or the final payment of the remaining balance under the Settlement Agreement could be required if the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of the Bank meets or exceeds 11 percent after adjusting for any outstanding TARP Preferred. Following the TARP Preferred redemption, which included a $200 million dividend from the Bank to Bancorp, the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is less than 11 percent. The combination of (a) future dividends from the Bank to Bancorp and (b) continued growth in earning assets at the Bank are expected to continue to limit the growth rate of the Bank s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, which could have an impact on the timing of expected cash flows under the Settlement Agreement.  
    
  The Settlement Agreement meets the definition of a financial instrument for which we elected the fair value option. The fair value of the liability is subject to significant uncertainty and is impacted by forecasted estimates of equity, earnings, timing and amount of dividends and growth of the balance sheet and their related impacts on forecasted Tier 1 Capital. We consider the assumptions a market participant would make to transfer the liability and evaluate multiple possible outcomes and our estimates of the likelihood of these outcomes, which may change over time.     
   
  Regulatory Capital Composition - Transition 
    
  The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific  
  
   87 

     Table of Contents  

capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. We are currently subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators 
    
   Effective January 1, 2015, we became subject to the Basel III rules, which include certain transition provisions. Capital deductions related to the Company's MSRs and deferred tax assets are recognized in 20 percent annual increments, and will be fully recognized as of January 1, 2018. When presented on a fully phased-in basis, capital, risk-weighted assets, and the capital ratios assume all regulatory capital adjustments and deductions are fully recognized. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank were subject to the transitional phase-in limitation on deductions related to MSRs and certain deferred tax assets. The annual incremental change in the deductions due to the increase in the transitional phase-in from 40 percent in 2015 to 60 percent in 2016 reduced our regulatory capital ratios. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, we became subject to the capital conservation buffer under the Basel III rules, subjecting a banking organization to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the organization does not maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer for 2016 must be greater than 0.625 percent in order to not be subject to limitations. The Company and the Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 7.3 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively as of   September 30, 2016  . When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer must be greater than 2.5 percent and will effectively increase the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0 percent, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio to 8.5 percent and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5 percent.   
    
  The new regulations grandfather the regulatory capital treatment of hybrid debt and equity securities, such as trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, for banks or holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were considered "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. The following tables show the regulatory capital ratios as of the dates indicated: 

(1) 
    Based on adjusted total assets for purposes of Tier 1 leverage capital and risk-weighted assets for purposes Tier1, common equity Tier 1, and total risk-based capital.  
       
  Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the Corporation and the Bank decreased at   September 30, 2016  , compared to December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of transactions related to the payoff of TARP, the payment of TARP dividends in arrears, along with an increase in the deductions related to DTAs and MSRs due to the change in the transitional phase-in limitation from 40 percent at   December 31, 2015   to 60 percent at   September 30, 2016  .

Banks with assets greater than $10 billion are required to submit a Dodd-Frank stress test ("DFAST") under the final rules established by their primary regulator. DFAST requires banks to project results over a nine-quarter planning horizon under three scenarios (baseline, adverse, and severely adverse) published by the Federal Reserve and to show that the bank would exceed regulatory minimum capital standards for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 common ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the Total risk-based capital ratio under all of these scenarios. We are not subject to the Federal Reserve s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") program. 
    
  Certain regulatory capital ratios for the Bank and the Company as of   September 30, 2016   are shown in the following table:

    See "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
       
  The impact to our Tier 1 leverage ratio is mostly driven by the treatment that mortgage servicing rights receive under Basel III. Over the long term, we plan to continue to reduce our mortgage servicing rights to Tier 1 ratio, taking into consideration market conditions to guide our pace of MSR reduction. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $302 million   of mortgage servicing rights, representing   24.6 percent   of Tier 1 capital. We will continue to look for opportunities to reduce our mortgage servicing rights exposure over time. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this report includes non-GAAP financial measures such as the estimated fully implemented Basel III capital levels and ratios. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to investors in helping to understand the underlying performance and trends of the Company. 
    
  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, which are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Readers should be aware of these limitations and should be cautious with respect to the use of such measures. To mitigate these limitations, we have practices in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate GAAP or regulatory components in their entirety and to ensure that our performance is properly reflected to facilitate consistent period-to-period comparisons. Our method of calculating these non-GAAP measures may differ from methods used by other companies. Although we believe the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this report enhance investors' understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for those financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory financial measure, can be found in this report. 
    
  Basel III (transitional) to Basel III (fully phased-in) reconciliation.   On January 1, 2015, the Basel III rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 capital. When fully phased-in, Basel III, will increase capital requirements through higher minimum capital levels as well as through increases in risk-weights for certain exposures. Additionally, the final Basel III rules place greater emphasis on common equity. In October 2013, the OCC and Federal Reserve released final rules detailing the U.S. implementation of Basel III and the application of the risk-based and leverage capital rules to top-tier savings and loan holding companies. We have transitioned to the Basel III framework beginning in January 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period extending through 2018. Accordingly, the calculations provided below are estimates. These measures are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures because they are not formally defined by GAAP and the Basel III implementation regulations. The Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, Total Capital and Leverage ratios will not be fully phased-in until January 1, 2018 and the Capital Conservation buffer will not be fully phased-in until January 1, 2019. The regulations are subject to change as

clarifying guidance becomes available and the calculations currently include our interpretations of the requirements including informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Other entities may calculate the Basel III ratios differently from ours based on their interpretation of the guidelines. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using the Basel III framework, we believe that it is useful to provide investors information enabling them to assess our capital adequacy on the same basis.

A meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the Corporation shall be held annually on the first Monday in March, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next following which is not a legal holiday, at noon.  If the annual meeting is not held on the day designated therefor, the meeting shall be held on such other date and at such time as the board of directors shall determine. 
  SECTION 3.    Special Meetings  .  Special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chief executive officer of the Corporation or by the chairman of the board, the president or the secretary of the Corporation at the direction of the board of directors. 
  SECTION 4.    Conduct of Meetings  .  Annual and special meetings shall be conducted in accordance with these Bylaws or as otherwise prescribed by the board of directors.  The chairman or the chief executive officer of the Corporation shall preside at such meetings.

If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books or records of the Corporation as of the record date prescribed in Section 6, with postage thereon prepaid.  If a shareholder be present at a meeting, or in writing waive notice thereof before or after the meeting, notice of the meeting to such shareholder shall be unnecessary.  When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting.  It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of any meeting adjourned for less than 30 days or of the business to be transacted at such adjourned meeting, other than an announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. 
  SECTION 6.    Fixing of Record Date  .  For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall fix in advance a date as the record date for any such  determination of shareholders.  Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days, and in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken.

  SECTION 7.    Voting Lists  .  The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make, at least ten (10) days before each meeting of shareholders, a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, with the address of and the number of shares held by each.  The record shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder of the Corporation during the whole time of the meeting.

  SECTION 8.    Quorum  .  A majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders.  If less than a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. 
  SECTION 9.    Proxies  .  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact.  Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors.  No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. 
  SECTION 10.    Voting  .  Unless otherwise provided by the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, at each election of directors every shareholder entitled to vote at such election shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held. Unless otherwise provided by the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, by statute, or by these Bylaws, a majority of those votes cast by shareholders at a lawful meeting shall be sufficient to pass on a transaction or matter, except in the election of directors, which election shall be determined by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. 
  SECTION 11.    Voting of Shares in the Name of Two or More Persons  .  When ownership of stock stands in the name of two or more persons, in the absence of written directions to the Corporation to the contrary, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation any one or more of such shareholders may cast, in person or by proxy, all votes to which such ownership is entitled.  In the event an attempt is made to cast conflicting votes, in person or by proxy, by the several persons in whose name shares of stock stand, the vote or votes to which these persons are entitled shall be cast as directed by a majority of those holding such stock and present in person or by proxy at such meeting, but no votes shall be cast for such stock if a majority cannot agree. 
  SECTION 12.    Voting of Shares by Certain Holders  .  Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.  Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name.  Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name.  Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed. 
  A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred. 
  Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the Corporation, nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the Corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting. 
  SECTION 13.    Inspectors of Election  .  In advance of any meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may appoint any persons, other than nominees for office, as inspectors of election to act at such meeting or any adjournment thereof.  The number of inspectors shall be either one or three.  If the board of directors so appoints either one or three inspectors, that appointment shall not be altered at the meeting.  If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the chairman of the board may make such appointment at the meeting.  In case any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the board or the president. 
  Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law, the duties of such inspectors shall include:  determining the number of shares of stock and the voting power of each share, the shares of stock represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots or consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote; counting and tabulating all votes or consents; determining the result; and such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. 
  SECTION 14.   Nominating Committee  .  The board of directors or a committee appointed by the board of directors shall act as a nominating committee for selecting the management nominees for election as directors.  Except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of the death or other incapacity of a management nominee, the nominating committee shall deliver written nominations to the secretary at least 20 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.  Provided such committee makes such nominations, no nominations for directors except those made by the nominating committee shall be voted upon at the annual meeting unless other nominations by shareholders are made in writing and delivered to the secretary of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation. 
  SECTION 15.    New Business  .  Any new business to be taken up at the annual meeting shall be stated in writing and filed with the secretary of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation.  This provision shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at the annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees, but in connection with such reports no new business shall be acted upon at such annual meeting unless stated and filed as provided in the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation. 
  ARTICLE III 
  BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
  SECTION 1.    General Powers  .  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be under the direction of its board of directors.  The chairman shall preside at all meetings of the board of directors.

  Each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted  for  a director must exceed the number of votes case  against  that director. 
  SECTION 3.    Regular Meetings  .  A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be determined by resolution of the board of directors without other notice than such resolution. 
  SECTION 4.    Special Meetings  .  Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by or at the request of the chairman, the chief executive officer or one-third of the directors.  The person calling the special meetings of the board of directors may fix any place as the place for holding any special meeting of the board of directors called by such persons. 
  Members of the board of directors may participate in special meetings by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.  Such participation shall constitute presence in person. 
  SECTION 5.    Notice  .  Written notice of any special meeting shall be given to each director at least 24 hours previous thereto.  Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing filed with the secretary.  The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the board of directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. 
  SECTION 6.    Quorum  .  A majority of the number of directors fixed by Section 2 of this Article III shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors, but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time.  Notice of any adjourned meeting shall be given in the same manner as prescribed by Section 5 of this Article III. 
  SECTION 7.    Manner of Acting  .  The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by these Bylaws, the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, or the Michigan Business Corporation Act. 
  SECTION 8.    Action Without a Meeting  .  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the directors. 
  SECTION 9.    Resignation  .  Any director may resign at any time by sending a written notice of such resignation to the home office of the Corporation addressed to the chairman of the board or the president.  Unless otherwise specified therein such resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the chairman of the board or the president. 
  SECTION 10.    Vacancies  .  Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation.  Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office or by election at an annual meeting or at a special meeting of the shareholders held for that purpose.  The term of such director shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation. 
  SECTION 11.    Compensation  .  Directors, as such, may receive such compensation for service on the board of directors as the board may determine. Members of either standing or special committees may be allowed such compensation as the board of directors may determine. 
  SECTION 12.    Removal of Directors  .  Any director or the entire board of directors may be removed only in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation. 
  ARTICLE IV 
  COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
  The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, as they may determine to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the business of the Corporation, and may prescribe the duties, constitution and procedures thereof.  Each committee shall consist of one or more directors of the Corporation appointed by a majority of the whole board.  The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. 
  The board shall have power at any time to change the members of, to fill vacancies in, and to discharge any committee of the board.  Any member of any such committee may resign at any time by giving notice to the Corporation; provided, however, that notice to the board, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the chairman of such committee, or the secretary shall be deemed to constitute notice to the Corporation.  Such resignation shall take effect upon receipt of such notice or at any later time specified therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.  Any member of any such committee may be removed at any time, either with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors at any meeting of the board called for that purpose. 
  ARTICLE V 
  OFFICERS 
  SECTION 1.    Positions  .  The officers of the Corporation shall be a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary and a treasurer, each of whom shall be elected by the board of directors.  The board of directors may also designate the chairman of the board as an officer.  The board of directors may designate one or more vice presidents as senior executive vice president, executive vice president, first vice president, senior vice president or assistant vice president.  The board of directors may also elect or authorize the appointment of such other officers as the business of the Corporation may require.  The officers shall have such authority and perform such duties as the board of directors may from time to time authorize or determine.  In the absence of action by the board of directors, the officers shall have such powers and duties as generally pertain to their respective offices. 
  SECTION 2.    Election and Term of Office  .  The officers of the Corporation shall be elected annually by the board of directors at the first meeting of the board of directors held after each annual meeting of the shareholders.  If the election of officers is not held at such meeting, such election shall be held as soon thereafter as possible.  Each officer shall hold office until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his death or until he shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided.  Election or appointment of an officer, employee or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.  The board of directors may authorize the Corporation to enter into an employment contract with any officer in accordance with state law; but no such contract shall impair the right of the board of directors to remove any officer at any time in accordance with Section 3 of this Article V. 
  SECTION 3.    Vacancies  .  A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the board of directors for the unexpired portion of the term. 
  SECTION 4.    Remuneration  .  The remuneration of the officers shall be fixed from time to time by the board of directors. 
  ARTICLE VI

To the extent permitted by applicable law, and except as otherwise prescribed by the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws with respect to certificates for shares, the board of directors or the executive committee may authorize any officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation.  Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. 
  SECTION 2.    Loans  .  No loans shall be contracted on behalf of the Corporation and no evidence of indebtedness shall be issued in its name unless authorized by the board of directors.  Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.

All checks, drafts or other orders for the payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the Corporation shall be signed by one or more officers, employees or agents of the Corporation in such manner, including in facsimile form, as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the board of directors. 
  SECTION 4.    Deposits  .  All funds of the Corporation not otherwise employed shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the Corporation in any of its duly authorized depositories as the board of directors may select. 
  ARTICLE VII 
  CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER 
  SECTION 1.    Certificates for Shares  .  The shares of the Corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, as provided in the Michigan Business Corporation Act.  The authorization does not affect shares of the Corporation already represented by certificates until the certificates are surrendered to the Corporation. The shares of the Corporation represented by certificates shall be signed by the chairman of the board, a vice-chairman of the board, the president or a vice president and by any other officer of the Corporation, and may be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof.  Any or all of the signatures upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent, or registered by a registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the Corporation.  If any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before the certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer at the date of its issue. 
  SECTION 2.    Form of Share Certificates  .  All certificates representing shares issued by the Corporation shall set forth upon the face or back that the Corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge a full statement of the designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights of the shares of each class authorized to be issued, the variations in the relative rights, preferences and limitations between the shares of each such series so far as the same have been fixed and determined, and the authority of the board of directors to designate and prescribe the relative rights, preferences and limitations of subsequent series. 
  Each certificate representing shares shall state upon its face:  That the Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Michigan; the name of the person to whom issued; and the number and class of shares, and the designation of the series, if any, which such certificate represents.  Other matters in regard to the form of the certificates shall be determined by the board of directors. 
  SECTION 3.    Payment for Shares  .  No certificate shall be issued for any share until such share is fully paid. 
  SECTION 4.    Form of Payment for Shares  .  The consideration for the issuance of shares shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation. 
  SECTION 5.    Transfer of Shares  .  Transfer of shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be made only on its stock transfer books.  Authority and transfer instructions for such transfer shall be given only by the holder of record thereof or by his legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of such authority, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Corporation.  Such transfer, with respect to certificated shares, shall be made only on surrender for cancellation of the certificated shares.  Such transfer, in the case of uncertificated shares, shall be made only upon compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form.  The person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed by the Corporation to be the owner thereof for all purposes.  No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred. 
  SECTION 6.    Lost Certificates  .  The board of directors may direct (i) a new certificate or (ii) uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed.  When authorizing such issue of (i) a new certificate or (ii) uncertificated shares, the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed. 
  ARTICLE VIII 
  FISCAL YEAR 
  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on the last day of December of each year or on such other date as shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. 
  ARTICLE IX

  ARTICLE X 
  CORPORATION SEAL 
  The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be in such form as the board of directors shall prescribe. 
  ARTICLE XI 
  AMENDMENTS 
  In accordance with the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be repealed, altered, amended or rescinded by the shareholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose (provided that notice of such proposed repeal, alteration, amendment or rescission is included in the notice of such meeting).  In addition, the board of directors may repeal, alter, amend or rescind these Bylaws by vote of a majority of the board of directors at a legal meeting held in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws.
