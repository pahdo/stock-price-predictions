    NOTES      TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
   (UNAUDITED)   
     
   1.             BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Maui Land   Pineapple Company, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ) in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information that are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 promulgated by Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes to financial statements required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  LIQUIDITY  
     
  On August 5, 2016, the Company refinanced its $26.4 million of outstanding bank loans under a $27.0 million revolving credit facility with First Hawaiian Bank (the  Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility matures on December 31, 2019 and provides for two optional one-year extension periods. The Company has pledged a significant portion of its real estate holdings as security for borrowings under the Credit Facility, limiting its ability to borrow additional funds.   
     
  The Credit Facility includes covenants requiring among other things, an initial minimum liquidity (as defined) of $0.5 million, a maximum of $45.0 million in total liabilities, and a limitation on new indebtedness. If the Company is unable to meet its covenants, borrowings under the Credit Facility may become immediately due, and it would not have sufficient liquidity to repay such outstanding borrowings.  
     
  Net proceeds from the sale of any real estate assets pledged as collateral under the Credit Facility are required to be repaid toward outstanding borrowings and will permanently reduce the revolving commitment amount, limiting the available drawing capacity for future working capital purposes.  
     
  The Company continues to undertake efforts to generate cash flow by employing its real estate assets in leasing and other arrangements, by the sale of several real estate assets, and by continued cost reduction efforts.  
     
   2.             USE OF ESTIMATES AND RECLASSIFICATIONS   
     
  The Company s reports for interim periods utilize numerous estimates of general and administrative expenses and other costs for the full year. Future actual amounts may differ from these estimates. Amounts reflected in interim reports are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. Certain amounts in the December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. Such amounts had no impact on total assets and liabilities or net income and comprehensive income previously reported.

3.             BASIC AND DILUTED SHARES   
     
  Basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed similar to basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares from share-based compensation arrangements had been issued.  
     
  Potentially dilutive shares arise from non-qualified stock options to purchase common stock and non-vested restricted stock. The treasury stock method is applied to determine the number of potentially dilutive shares for non-vested restricted stock and stock options assuming that the shares of non-vested restricted stock are issued for an amount based on the grant date market price of the shares and that the outstanding stock options are exercised.  
     
   4  .                           PROPERTY

  Most of the Company s 23,000 acres of land were acquired between 1911 and 1932 and is carried in its balance sheets at cost. Approximately 21,000 acres of land are located in West Maui and comprise a largely contiguous parcel that extends from the shoreline to an elevation of approximately 5,700 feet. This parcel includes approximately 900 acres within the Kapalua Resort s 3,000 acres. The Company s remaining 2,000 acres of land are located in Upcountry Maui in an area commonly known as Haliimaile and are mainly comprised of leased agricultural fields, including processing and maintenance facilities.

Also included is the Company s potable and non-potable water systems in West Maui. The majority of the Company s land improvements were constructed and placed in service in the mid-to-late 1970 s.

  Buildings are comprised of restaurant, retail and light industrial spaces located at the Kapalua Resort and Haliimaile which are used in the Company s leasing operations.

As part of the transaction, the buyer also agreed to provide to the Company 12 residential workforce housing credits by August 2021. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $2.8 million. The Company utilized the proceeds from the sale to pay down its First Hawaiian Bank credit facility.  
     
  In June 2016, the Company sold a 304-acre, fully-entitled working-class community project located in West Maui, commonly referred to as Pulelehua, for $15.0 million. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $14.3 million. The Company utilized the proceeds from the sale to payoff its American AgCredit term loan.  
     
  In September 2015, the Company sold the 25-acre Kapalua Golf Academy parcel and related facilities for $12.0 million. The property was sold without any development entitlements.

On August 5, 2016, the Company refinanced its $26.4 million of outstanding bank loans under a $27.0 million revolving credit facility with First Hawaiian Bank.

Interest on borrowings is at LIBOR plus 3.75%, until such time as the Company obtains regulatory approval for the pledging of the stock of one of its utility subsidiaries, upon which interest decreases to LIBOR plus 3.50%.   
     
  The Credit Facility is secured by a significant portion of the Company s real estate holdings, including approximately 850 acres within the Kapalua Resort and approximately 1,065 acres in Haliimaile. Net proceeds from the sale of any real estate assets pledged as collateral under the Credit Facility are required to be repaid toward outstanding borrowings and will permanently reduce the revolving commitment amount.  
     
  The terms of the Credit Facility include various representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants include an initial minimum liquidity (as defined) of $0.5 million beginning December 31, 2016, a maximum of $45.0 million in total liabilities, and a limitation on new indebtedness.

               C  OMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       
     
  There have been no changes in the status of commitments and contingencies as reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

12  .              
 
             F  AIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS       
     
  GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements to enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. GAAP requires that financial assets and liabilities be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  
     
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
     
  Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.  
     
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.  
     
  The fair value of cash, receivables and payables approximate their carrying value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The valuation is based on settlements of similar financial instruments all of which are short-term in nature and are generally settled at or near cost. The fair value of debt was estimated based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities. The carrying amount of debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $24.5 million and $40.6 million, respectively, which approximated fair value. The fair value of debt has been classified in the level 2 category.

   Overview    
     
  Maui Land   Pineapple Company, Inc. is a Hawaii corporation and the successor to a business organized in 1909. The Company consists of a landholding and operating parent company, its principal subsidiary, Kapalua Land Company, Ltd. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company.  
     
  We own approximately 23,000 acres of land on Maui and develop, sell, and manage residential, resort, agricultural, commercial, and industrial real estate through the following business segments:  

Real Estate  Our real estate operations consist of land planning and entitlement, development, and sales.     

Leasing  Our leasing activities include residential, resort, commercial, industrial and agricultural land and property leases, licensing of our registered trademarks and trade names, and stewardship and conservation efforts.

Table Of Contents 

Utilities  We operate two publicly-regulated utility companies which provide potable and non-potable water and wastewater transmission services to the Kapalua Resort. In addition, we also manage several major non-potable irrigation water systems in West and Upcountry Maui.     

Resort Amenities  We manage the operations of the Kapalua Club, a private, non-equity club providing its members special programs, access and other privileges at certain amenities at the Kapalua Resort.     
     
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of accounting estimates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein. Our critical accounting policies that require the use of estimates and assumptions were discussed in detail in our most recently filed Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the first nine months of 2016.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
     
   Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
  CONSOLIDATED  

Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 resulted primarily from sales of real estate assets, the proceeds from which were used to reduce our bank debt. Included in pension and other postretirement expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is a reduction of approximately $0.7 million resulting from a one-time payment settlement with certain participants of our non-qualified retirement plans, which was paid in October 2016.  
     
  REAL ESTATE  

In August 2016, we sold a five-acre, fully-entitled 42-unit workforce housing project located in West Maui for $3.0 million. As part of the transaction, the buyer also agreed to provide us with 12 residential workforce housing credits by August 2021. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $2.8 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down our First Hawaiian Bank credit facility.

Table Of Contents 

In June 2016, we sold a 304-acre, fully entitled working-class community project located in West Maui, commonly referred to as Pulelehua, for $15.0 million. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $14.3 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to payoff our American AgCredit term loan. In September 2015, we sold the 25-acre Kapalua Golf Academy parcel and related facilities for $12.0 million. The property was sold without any development entitlements. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $10.5 million. The majority of the proceeds from the sale were used to pay down our American AgCredit term loan and Wells Fargo credit facility.  
     
  Also included in our real estate operating revenues were sales commissions from resales of properties owned by private residents in the Kapalua Resort and surrounding areas by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kapalua Realty Company, Ltd.     
     
  We did not have any significant real estate development expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  
     
  Real estate sales and development are cyclical and depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends in this business segment.  
     
  LEASING  

The decrease in operating income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the write-off of approximately $0.5 million of lease rent from an agricultural land and property tenant in Upcountry Maui.   
     
  Other West Maui leased properties are mainly large-acre former pineapple field parcels and maintenance facilities.  
     
  Our leasing operations face substantial competition from other property owners in Maui and Hawaii.  
     
  UTILITIES  

We have contracted a third-party water engineering and management company to manage the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Kapalua Water Company, Ltd. and Kapalua Waste Treatment Company, Ltd. We have contracted a water maintenance company to manage our non-potable/irrigation water systems in West and Upcountry Maui.  
     
  The increase in operating revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the increase in consumption of non-potable water. The decrease in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior period was primarily due to higher repair and maintenance costs during the quarter.

RESORT AMENITIES AND OTHER    

Dues collected from our Kapalua Club members are utilized principally to pay for access and other privileges to amenities operated by outside third parties in the Kapalua Resort.  
     
  Included in our September 30, 2015 other operating income is a non-recurring $70,000 payment to secure a property easement and $40,000 of cash received for the surrender value of an insurance policy.  
     
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
     
   Liquidity   
     
  On August 5, 2016, we refinanced our $26.4 million of outstanding bank loans under a $27.0 million revolving credit facility with First Hawaiian Bank. The Credit Facility matures on December 31, 2019 and provides for two optional one-year extension periods. We have pledged a significant portion of our real estate holdings as collateral for borrowings under the Credit Facility, limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.   
     
  The Credit Facility includes covenants requiring among other things, an initial minimum liquidity (as defined) of $0.5 million, a maximum of $45 million in total liabilities, and a limitation on new indebtedness. If we are unable to meet our covenants, borrowings under the Credit Facility may become immediately due, and we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay such outstanding borrowings.  
     
  Net proceeds from the sale of any real estate assets pledged as collateral under the Credit Facility are required to be repaid toward outstanding borrowings and will permanently reduce the revolving commitment amount, limiting the available drawing capacity for future working capital purposes.  
     
  We believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our Credit Facility.  
     
     Cash Flows   
     
  During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by our operating activities were $16.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively, resulting primarily from real estate asset sales. Proceeds from the sales were used to reduce our bank debt.  
     
     Future Cash Inflows and Outflows   
     
  Our plans include continued efforts to generate cash flow by employing our real estate assets in leasing and other arrangements, by the sale of several real estate assets, and by continued cost reduction efforts. Proceeds from the sale of any of our real estate assets will be used principally to repay our outstanding bank debt.  
     
  We presently do not expect to be required to make minimum contributions to our pension plans in 2016. Our current development activities are limited to planning, permitting and other efforts to secure and maintain project entitlements and we do not have any significant development or capital expenditures planned at this time.

FORWARD   -LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISKS  
     
  This and other reports filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as  may,   will,   project,   might,   expect,   believe,   anticipate,   intend,   could,   would,   estimate,   continue  or  pursue,  or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements as a result of the following factors, among others:  

unstable macroeconomic market conditions, including, but not limited to, energy costs, credit markets, interest rates and changes in income and asset values;     

risks associated with real estate investments generally, and more specifically, demand for real estate and tourism in Hawaii;     

risks due to joint venture relationships;     

our ability to complete land development projects within forecasted time and budget expectations, if at all;     

our ability to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable costs, if at all;     

our ability to compete with other developers of real estate in Maui;     

potential liabilities and obligations under various federal, state and local environmental regulations with respect to the presence of hazardous or toxic substances;     

changes in weather conditions or the occurrence of natural disasters;     

our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange;     

our ability to comply with funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans;     

our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness, including the financial covenants set forth therein, and to extend maturity dates, or refinance such indebtedness, prior to its maturity date;     

our expectation, absent the sale of some of our real estate holdings or refinancing, that we do not expect to be able to repay any significant amount of our debt;     

our ability to raise capital through the sale of certain real estate assets; and     

availability of capital on terms favorable to us, or at all.     

Such risks and uncertainties also include those risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled  Business,   Risk Factors,  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  Risk Factors  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as other factors described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC. Although we believe that our opinions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date of this report, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements, and our actual results may differ substantially from the views and expectations set forth in this report. Thus, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly revise our forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report.  
     
    Item      3. Q  UANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
  We are not required to provide disclosure in response to Part 1: Item 3 of Form 10-Q because we are considered to be a  smaller reporting company.

Item      4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
     
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
     
  As required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report. Based upon the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms.  
     
    Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting    
     
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    

PART        II OTHER INFORMATION   
     
    Item      1A.   RISK FACTORS   
     
  Potential risks and uncertainties include, among other things, those factors discussed in the sections entitled  Business,   Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form   10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q. Readers should carefully review those risks and the risks and uncertainties disclosed in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.
