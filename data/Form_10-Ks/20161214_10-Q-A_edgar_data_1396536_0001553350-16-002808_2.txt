Explanatory Note   
   
 This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A ( Amendment No. 1 ) to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (the  Original Filing ) of Duos Technologies Group, Inc. (the Company ) is being filed solely for the purpose of amending and restating in its entirety Part I, Item 4 (Controls and Procedures) to change the conclusions regarding the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. In the Original Filing, the Company erroneously reported that its controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016 due to a material weakness noted in the Original Filing. In fact, the Company s control and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016. The Amendment No.1 corrects the disclosure to Part I, Item 4 (Controls and Procedures).  
   
 In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Securities Exchange Act ), Part I, Item 4 of the Original Filing have been amended and restated in its entirety, and Part II, Item 6 (Exhibits) of the Original Filing has been amended solely to include as exhibits the new certifications required by Rule 13a-14(a) under the Securities Exchange Act.  
   
 This Amendment No. 1 does not amend or otherwise update any other information in the Original Filing. Except as noted above, this Amendment No. 1 does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Report.  Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
