  (1) General   
  The interim consolidated financial statements are presented herein and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("IMI"), and its subsidiaries ("we" or "us") store records, primarily physical records and data backup media, and provide information management services in various locations throughout North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa. We have a diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations. 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, but we believe that the disclosures included herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, which are included herein, should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016 (our "Annual Report"). 
  We have been organized and have operated as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes ("REIT") effective for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014.  
  On May 2, 2016 (Sydney, Australia time), we completed the acquisition of Recall Holdings Limited ("Recall") pursuant to the Scheme Implementation Deed, as amended, with Recall (the "Recall Transaction"). At the closing of the Recall Transaction, we paid approximately   $331,800   and issued   50,233,412   shares of our common stock which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of April 29, 2016 (the last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction) of   $36.53   per share, resulted in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately   $2,166,900  . See Note 4. 
   
  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  This Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides information and disclosure regarding certain of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report, which may provide additional information with regard to the accounting policies set forth herein and other of our significant accounting policies.    
  a. Foreign Currency 
  Local currencies are the functional currencies for our operations outside the United States, with the exception of certain foreign holding companies and our financing centers in Europe, whose functional currency is the United States dollar. In those instances where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items, net component of Iron Mountain Incorporated Stockholders' Equity and Noncontrolling Interests in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, calculated as the difference between the historical exchange rate and the exchange rate at the applicable measurement date, including those related to (1) our previously outstanding 6   3   /   4   % Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "6   3   /   4   % Notes"), (2) borrowings in certain foreign currencies under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5) and (3) certain foreign currency denominated intercompany obligations of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries, which are not considered permanently invested, are included in Other Expense (Income), Net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

b.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
  We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our most recent annual     goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2015 and concluded there was   no   impairment of goodwill at such date. As of   December 31, 2015  , no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2015 goodwill analysis. While several of our reporting units were impacted by our acquisition of Recall, no factors were identified as of September 30, 2016 that would indicate an impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we considered a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. 
  Refer to our Annual Report for information regarding the composition of our reporting units as of December 31, 2015. The carrying value of goodwill, net for each of our reporting units as of   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    This reporting unit is included in the North American Records and Information Management Business segment. 
              (2)

  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

In the third quarter of 2016, as a result of changes in the management of our businesses included in our Western European Business segment, we reassessed the composition of our reporting units. As a result of this reassessment, we determined that the businesses included in our former UKI reporting unit were now being managed in conjunction with the businesses included in our former Continental Western Europe reporting unit. As a result, as of September 30, 2016, we have concluded that our Western European Business segment consists of one reporting unit, which is referred to herein as the Western Europe reporting unit. 
  The acquisition of Recall, which is more fully disclosed in Note 4, impacted our reporting units as of   September 30, 2016   as follows:  
             
    North American Records and Information Management - includes the goodwill associated with the records and information management businesses of Recall in the United States and Canada.  
                
    North American Secure Shredding - includes the goodwill associated with the secure shredding businesses of Recall in the United States and Canada.  
                
    North American Data Management - includes the goodwill associated with the data management businesses of Recall in the United States and Canada. 
                
    Western Europe - includes the goodwill associated with the operations of Recall in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom as well as the goodwill associated with the document management solutions ( DMS ) operations of Recall in Sweden. 
                
    Northern and Eastern Europe - this reporting unit consists of our former Emerging Markets - Europe reporting unit (as described in our Annual Report), and includes the goodwill associated with the operations of Recall in Denmark, Finland and Norway, as well as the goodwill associated with the records and information management operations of Recall in Sweden. This reporting unit is included in the Other International Business segment. 
                
    Latin America - includes the goodwill associated with the operations of Recall in Brazil and Mexico.  
                
    Australia and New Zealand - this reporting unit consists of the goodwill associated with the Australia Retained Business (as defined in Note 4), which was a component of our former Australia reporting unit, as well as the operations of Recall in Australia and New Zealand. This reporting unit is included in the Other International Business segment. 
                
    Southeast Asia - includes the goodwill associated with the operations of Recall in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.

 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1)

Finite-lived intangible assets 
  Customer relationship intangible assets, which are acquired through either business combinations or acquisitions of customer relationships, are amortized over periods ranging from   10   to   30   years. The value of customer relationship intangible assets is calculated based upon estimates of their fair value utilizing an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows. 
  Costs related to the acquisition of large volume accounts are capitalized. Free intake costs to transport boxes to one of our facilities, which include labor and transportation charges ("Move Costs"), are amortized over periods ranging from   one   to   30   years, and are included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate the customer's existing contract with that vendor, or direct payments to a customer ("Permanent Withdrawal Fees"), are amortized over periods ranging from   one   to   15   years and are included in storage and service revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Move Costs and Permanent Withdrawal Fees are collectively referred to as "Customer Inducements". If the customer terminates its relationship with us, the unamortized carrying value of the Customer Inducement intangible asset is charged to expense or revenue. However, in the event of such termination, we generally collect, and record as income, permanent removal fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the unamortized Customer Inducement intangible asset.  
  Other intangible assets, including noncompetition agreements and trademarks, are capitalized and amortized over periods ranging from   five   to   10   years. 
    
  The components of our finite-lived intangible assets as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 
   
 _______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Included in Other, a component of Other Assets, Net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     Amortization expense associated with finite-lived intangible assets and deferred financing costs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016 is as follows:

c.    Stock-Based Compensation 
  We record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance units ("PUs") and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") (together, "Employee Stock-Based Awards"). 
  Stock-based compensation expense for Employee Stock-Based Awards included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $6,159   (  $4,502   after tax or   $0.02   per basic and diluted share) and   $20,936   (  $14,915   after tax or   $0.07   per basic and diluted share), respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for Employee Stock-Based Awards for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $5,957   (  $4,245   after tax or   $0.02   per basic and diluted share) and   $21,870   (  $16,170   after tax or   $0.07   per basic and diluted share), respectively.  
  Stock-based compensation expense for Employee Stock-Based Awards included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows: 

The benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are required to be reported as financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This requirement impacts reported operating cash flows and reported financing cash flows. As a result, net financing cash flows included   $323   and   $91   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , respectively, from the benefit of tax deductions compared to recognized compensation cost. The tax benefit of any resulting excess tax deduction increases the Additional Paid-in Capital ("APIC") pool. Any resulting tax deficiency is deducted from the APIC pool.  
  Stock Options 
  A summary of our stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 by vesting terms is as follows:

  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

The weighted average fair value of stock options granted for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   was   $4.88   and   $2.55   per share, respectively. These values were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used for grants in the respective period are as follows: 

Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the stock option. The risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury interest rates whose term is consistent with the expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options. Expected dividend yield is considered in the stock option pricing model and represents our current annualized expected per share dividends over the current trade price of our common stock. The expected life of the stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. 
  A summary of stock option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows:  

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   is as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units 
  Under our various equity compensation plans, we may also grant RSUs. Our RSUs generally have a vesting period of between   three   and   five   years from the date of grant. However, RSUs granted to our non-employee directors in 2015 and thereafter vest immediately upon grant.  
  All RSUs accrue dividend equivalents associated with the underlying stock as we declare dividends. Dividends will generally be paid to holders of RSUs in cash upon the vesting date of the associated RSU and will be forfeited if the RSU does not vest. The fair value of RSUs is the excess of the market price of our common stock at the date of grant over the purchase price (which is typically zero).

The fair value of RSUs vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   is as follows: 

A summary of RSU activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

Performance Units 
  Under our various equity compensation plans, we may also make awards of PUs. For the majority of outstanding PUs, the number of PUs earned is determined based on our performance against predefined targets of revenue and return on invested capital ("ROIC"). The number of PUs earned may range from   0%   to   200%   of the initial award. The number of PUs earned is determined based on our actual performance as compared to the targets at the end of a   three  -year performance period. Certain PUs that we grant will be earned based on a market condition associated with the total return on our common stock in relation to a subset of the Standard   Poor's 500 Index rather than the revenue and ROIC targets noted above. The number of PUs earned based on this market condition may range from   0%   to   200%   of the initial award.  
  All of our PUs will be settled in shares of our common stock and are subject to cliff vesting   three   years from the date of the original PU grant. PUs awarded to employees who terminate their employment during the   three  -year performance period and on or after attaining age   55   and completing   10   years of qualifying service are eligible for pro-rated vesting, subject to the actual achievement against the predefined targets or a market condition as discussed above, based on the number of full years of service completed following the grant date (but delivery of the shares remains deferred). As a result, PUs are generally expensed over the three-year performance period. 
  All PUs accrue dividend equivalents associated with the underlying stock as we declare dividends. Dividends will generally be paid to holders of PUs in cash upon the settlement date of the associated PU and will be forfeited if the PU does not vest.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   230,052   PUs. The majority of our PUs are earned based on our performance against revenue and ROIC targets during their applicable performance period; therefore, we forecast the likelihood of achieving the predefined revenue and ROIC targets in order to calculate the expected PUs to be earned. We record a compensation charge based on either the forecasted PUs to be earned (during the performance period) or the actual PUs earned (at the three-year anniversary of the grant date) over the vesting period for each of the awards. For PUs earned based on a market condition, we utilize a Monte Carlo simulation to fair value these awards at the date of grant, and such fair value is expensed over the three-year performance period. As of   September 30, 2016  , we expected   0%  ,   50%   and   100%   achievement of the predefined revenue and ROIC targets associated with the awards of PUs made in   2014  ,   2015   and   2016  , respectively. 
  The fair value of earned PUs that vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016 is as follows: 

A summary of PU activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Represents an increase or decrease in the number of original PUs awarded based on either the final performance criteria or market condition achievement at the end of the performance period of such PUs or a change in estimated awards based on the forecasted performance against the predefined targets. 
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  We offer an ESPP in which participation is available to substantially all United States and Canadian employees who meet certain service eligibility requirements. The price for shares purchased under the ESPP is   95%   of the market price of our common stock at the end of the offering period, without a look-back feature. As a result, we do not recognize compensation expense for the ESPP shares purchased. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , there were   59,569   shares and   56,662   shares, respectively, purchased under the ESPP. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   781,767   shares available under the ESPP.

  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our Employee Stock-Based Awards was   $43,137   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.0   years. 
  We generally issue shares of our common stock for the exercises of stock options, RSUs, PUs and shares of our common stock under our ESPP from unissued reserved shares. 
  d.    Income (Loss) Per Share Basic and Diluted 
  Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share is consistent with that of basic income (loss) per share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is, securities such as stock options, warrants or convertible securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive. 
  The calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016 is as follows:

e.    Income Taxes 
  We provide for income taxes during interim periods based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period they occur. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qualified REIT subsidiaries and our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), as well as among the jurisdictions in which we operate; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and losses; (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize net operating losses that we generate.   
  Our effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   14.3%   and   18.6%  , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 were   81.2%   and   46.2%  , respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of   35.0%   and our overall effective tax rates in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction, differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of   $4,100   related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and an out-of-period tax adjustment (  $9,000   tax benefit) to correct the valuation of certain deferred tax assets associated with the REIT conversion that occurred in 2014. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of   35.0%   and our overall effective tax rates in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction, differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, and the impact of the   $14,000   charge (described in Note 2.i.) recorded during the third quarter of 2016 related to the anticipated loss on disposal of the Australia Divestment Business (as defined in Note 4), which had no associated tax benefit.  
  f.    Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   relate to cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2015, we had time deposits with   four   global banks. At September 30, 2016, we had time deposits with   six   global banks. We consider the global banks to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents were   $128,381   and   $458,128  , respectively, including time deposits amounting to   $18,645   and   $18,687  , respectively.  
  g.    Fair Value Measurements 
  Our financial assets or liabilities that are carried at fair value are required to be measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
  Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. 
  Level 2 Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). 
  Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

The assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, are as follows: 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Time deposits and certain trading securities are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets and/or subsequent transactions and are included in Prepaid expenses and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
       
           (2) 
    Available-for-sale securities and certain trading securities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. 
     Disclosures are required in the financial statements for items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. We did not have any material items that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, with the exception of: (i) goodwill (as disclosed in Note 2.b.); (ii) the assets and liabilities acquired through acquisitions (as disclosed in Note 4); (iii) the Access Contingent Consideration (as defined and disclosed in Note 4); and (iv) assets and liabilities held for sale (as disclosed in Note 10), all of which are based on Level 3 inputs.           
  The fair value of our long-term debt, which was determined based on either Level 1 inputs or Level 3 inputs, is disclosed in Note 5. Long-term debt is measured at cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  .

i.    Other Expense (Income), Net 
  Other expense (income), net for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   2015 and 2016 are as follows: 

Other, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a charge of   $14,000   associated with the anticipated loss on disposal of the Australia Divestment Business. As disclosed in Note 10, we have determined that the Australia Divestment Business met the criteria to be reported as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Australia Divestment Business is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value (less costs to sell). This charge represents the excess of the carrying value of the Australia Divestment Business compared to its fair value (less costs to sell) as of September 30, 2016, based upon the sale price of the business described more fully in Note 13. 
  j.    Property, Plant and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we capitalized   $6,844   and   $19,279   of costs, respectively, associated with the development of internal use computer software projects. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we capitalized   $3,601   and   $12,139   of costs, respectively, associated with the development of internal use computer software projects.  
  Consolidated (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $(141)   and   $707  , respectively. Losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of the write-off of certain property associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment. Consolidated gains on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $54   and   $1,131  , respectively, which were primarily associated with the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment. 
  Consolidated gain on sale of real estate was   $850  , net of tax of   $209  , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was associated with the sale of a building in the United Kingdom. Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $325  , net of tax of   $34  , associated with the sale of land in North America.

k.    New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 provides guidance for management to reassess revenue recognition as it relates to: (1) transfer of control, (2) variable consideration, (3) allocation of transaction price based on relative standalone selling price, (4) licenses, (5) time value of money, and (6) contract costs. Further disclosures will be required to provide a better understanding of revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   ("ASU 2015-14"). ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year, making it effective for us on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles of current United States auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt , (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is still present, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt ASU 2014-15 as of January 1, 2017. We do not believe that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015 02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ("ASU 2015-17"). ASU No. 2015-17 eliminates the requirement for reporting entities to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, reporting entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. ASU 2015-17 is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2015-17 will have on our consolidated financial statements.    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01"). ASU 2016-01 requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. The pronouncement also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We do not believe that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 also will require certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ("ASU 2016-07"). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement for a reporting entity to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when they obtain significant influence over a previously held investment. Furthermore, under ASU 2016-07, for any available-for-sale securities that become eligible for the equity method of accounting, the unrealized gain or loss recorded within other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the securities should be recognized in earnings at the date the investment initially qualifies for the use of the equity method. We adopted ASU 2016-07 on April 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under ASU 2016-09, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the statement of operations and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.   
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 )  .   ASU 2016-15     addresses eight specific cash flow changes with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in the practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-15 during the third quarter of 2016.   ASU 2016-15 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

  (3) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

Historically, we have entered into forward contracts to hedge our exposures in Euros, British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , however, we had no forward contracts outstanding.  
  Net cash (receipts) payments included in cash from operating activities related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   are as follows: 

(Gains) losses for our derivative instruments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   are as follows: 

We have designated a portion of our previously outstanding 6   3   /   4   % Notes and Euro denominated borrowings by IMI under our Revolving Credit Facility (discussed more fully in Note 5) as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016  , we designated, on average,   35,151   and   29,858   Euros, respectively, of the previously outstanding 6   3   /   4   % Notes and Euro denominated borrowings by IMI under our Revolving Credit Facility as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded the following foreign exchange (losses) gains, net of tax, related to the change in fair value of such debt due to currency translation adjustments, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , cumulative net gains of   $16,195  , net of tax, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge.

  (4)  Acquisitions  

We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values and the results of operations for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. Cash consideration for our various acquisitions in 2016 was primarily provided through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Bridge Facility (each as defined in Note 5), as well as cash and cash equivalents on-hand.   
  a.  Acquisition of Recall 
    
  On May 2, 2016 (Sydney, Australia time), we completed the Recall Transaction. At the closing of the Recall Transaction, we paid approximately   $331,800   and issued   50,233,412   shares of our common stock which, based on the closing price of our common stock as of April 29, 2016 (the last day of trading on the NYSE prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction) of $  36.53   per share, resulted in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately   $2,166,900  .  
    
  Regulatory Approvals 
  In connection with the acquisition of Recall, we sought regulatory approval of the Recall Transaction from the United States Department of Justice (the  DOJ ), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the  ACCC ), the Canada Competition Bureau (the  CCB ), and the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (the  CMA ). 
  As part of the regulatory approval process, we agreed to make certain divestments, which are described below in greater detail, in order to address competition concerns raised by the DOJ, the ACCC, the CCB and the CMA in respect of the Recall Transaction (the  Divestments ).  
  See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Divestments, including the presentation of the Divestments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016, our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  
    
  Divestments and Management Pending Sales 
    
  i.   United States 
    
  The DOJ s approval of the Recall Transaction was subject to the following divestments being made by us following the closing of the Recall Transaction: 

Recall s records and information management facilities, including all associated tangible and intangible assets, in the following   13   United States cities: Buffalo, New York; Charlotte, North Carolina; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas/Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; San Antonio, Texas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and San Diego, California (the  Initial United States Divestments  and 
                
    Recall s records and information management facility in Seattle, Washington and certain of Recall s records and information management facilities in Atlanta, Georgia, including in each case associated tangible and intangible assets (the  Seattle/Atlanta Divestments ).

  (4) Acquisitions (Continued) 

On May 4, 2016, we completed the sale of the Initial United States Divestments to Access CIG, LLC, a privately held provider of information management services throughout the United States ( Access CIG ), for total consideration of approximately   $80,000  , subject to adjustments (the  Access Sale ). Of the total consideration, we received   $55,000   in cash proceeds upon closing of the Access Sale, and we are entitled to receive up to   $25,000   of additional cash proceeds on the 27-month anniversary of the closing of the Access Sale (the "Access Contingent Consideration"). Our estimate of the fair value of the Access Contingent Consideration is approximately   $21,400   (which reflects a fair value adjustment of approximately   $2,200   and a present value adjustment of approximately   $1,400  ), and accordingly, we have recognized a non-trade receivable included in Other, a component of Other Assets, Net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 for this amount. 
    
  The assets subject to the Access Sale were acquired in the Recall Transaction and, therefore, the estimated fair value of the Access Contingent Consideration has been reflected in the allocation of the purchase price for Recall as a component of  Fair Value of Divestments . Our policy related to the recognition of contingent consideration (from a seller s perspective) is to recognize contingent consideration at its estimated fair value upon closing of the transaction. Our policy related to the subsequent measurement of contingent consideration (from a seller s perspective) is (i) to recognize contingent consideration in excess of our original estimate of fair value upon cash receipt of such consideration and (ii) to recognize any impairment of the contingent consideration compared to our original estimate in the period in which we determine such an impairment exists.   
    
  The Seattle/Atlanta Divestments will be effected by way of a sale of the tangible and intangible assets associated with the relevant facilities, which include warehouse space as well as customer contracts. We have agreed to place the assets and employees subject to the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments in a hold separate arrangement until the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments are completed.  
    
  In October 2016, we entered into an agreement with a potential buyer that provides for the sale of the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments and the Canadian Divestments (as described and defined below) to such potential buyer. This agreement remains subject to approval by the DOJ and the CCB as well as customary closing conditions and, therefore, we can provide no assurances that the DOJ and the CCB will approve the agreement, or that even with such approval that we will complete the sale on the terms agreed, or at all.  
    
  ii.  Australia 
  The ACCC approved the Recall Transaction after accepting an undertaking from us pursuant to section 87B of the   Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010   (Cth) (the  ACCC Undertaking ). Pursuant to the ACCC Undertaking, we agreed to divest the majority of our Australian operations as they existed prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction by way of a share sale, which effectively involves the sale of our Australian business (as it existed prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction) other than our data management business throughout Australia and our records and information management business in the Northern Territory of Australia, except in relation to customers who have holdings in other Australian states or territories (the  Australia Divestment Business  and, with respect to the portion of our Australia business that is not subject to divestment, the  Australia Retained Business ).   
    
  Pursuant to the ACCC Undertaking, any prospective purchaser of the Australia Divestment Business is subject to ACCC approval. On October 24, 2016, we received the requisite clearance from the ACCC to sell the Australia Divestment Business and, on October 31, 2016, we completed the sale of the Australia Divestment Business. See Note 13.

iii.  Canada 
    
  The CCB approved the Recall Transaction on the basis of the registration of a consent agreement with us pursuant to sections 92 and 105 of the   Competition Act   (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-34) (the  CCB Consent Agreement ). The CCB Consent Agreement requires us to divest the following assets: 

Recall s record and information management facilities, including associated tangible and intangible assets and employees, in Edmonton, Alberta and Montreal (Laval), Quebec and certain of Recall s record and information management facilities, including all associated tangible and intangible assets and employees, in Calgary, Alberta and Toronto, Ontario, (the  Recall Canadian Divestments  and 
                
    One of our records and information management facilities in Vancouver (Burnaby), British Columbia and one of our records and information management facilities in Ottawa, Ontario, including associated tangible and intangible assets and employees (the  Iron Mountain Canadian Divestments ). 
       
  The Recall Canadian Divestments and the Iron Mountain Canadian Divestments (or collectively, the  Canadian Divestments ) will be affected by way of a sale of only the tangible and intangible assets associated with the relevant facilities, which include warehouse space as well as customer contracts. Under the CCB Consent Agreement, the assets subject of the Canadian Divestments will be acquired by a single buyer to be approved by the Commissioner of Competition (the  Commissioner ). 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the CCB Consent Agreement, in order to preserve the businesses of the Canadian Divestments, pending completion of a sale of the Canadian Divestments, we must maintain the economic viability and marketability of the businesses of the Canadian Divestments, and we are required to hold the Recall Canadian Divestments separate from those of our other operations. In addition, the business of the Recall Canadian Divestments is being managed by an independent manager selected by us and approved by the Commissioner.   
    
  In October 2016, we entered into an agreement with a potential buyer that provides for the sale of the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments and the Canadian Divestments to such potential buyer. This agreement remains subject to approval by the DOJ and the CCB as well as customary closing conditions and, therefore, we can provide no assurances that the DOJ and the CCB will approve the agreement, or that even with such approval that we will complete the sale, on the terms agreed or at all.   
    
  iv.  United Kingdom 
    
  In January 2016, the CMA referred the Recall Transaction for further investigation and report by a group of CMA panel members who were responsible for determining whether the Recall Transaction would result in a substantial lessening of competition within the relevant United Kingdom markets (the  CMA Review ). On March 30, 2016, the CMA announced its conditional consent for the Recall Transaction prior to the CMA s issuance of its final decision following the CMA Review (the  CMA Consent ). On June 16, 2016, the CMA completed the CMA Review and published its findings. The findings concluded that the Recall Transaction is not expected to result in any substantial lessening of competition outside of North East Scotland, but that the Recall Transaction may result in a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of records management and information management services (including records management and physical offsite data protection services) in the Aberdeen and Dundee areas of Scotland (the  Scotland Affected Areas ). As a result of the CMA s decision, we will divest Recall s record and information management facilities, including associated tangible and intangible assets and employees, in the Scotland Affected Areas (the  UK Divestments ).

Pursuant to the CMA Consent, in order to preserve the business of the UK Divestments, pending completion of the sale of the UK Divestments, we must maintain the economic viability and marketability of the business of the UK Divestments, and we are required to hold the UK Divestments separate from those of our other operations. In addition, the CMA concluded that a monitoring trustee should be appointed, at our sole expense and subject to CMA approval, to monitor compliance with the CMA s findings and to ensure a prompt sale of the UK Divestments. We are in discussions with potential buyers for the UK Divestments. Aside from the CMA s eventual approval of the purchaser of the UK Divestments, this decision marks the completion of the CMA Review. 
  _______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
  The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information (the "Pro Forma Financial Information") below summarizes the combined results of us and Recall on a pro forma basis as if the Recall Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2015. The Pro Forma Financial Information is presented for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2015. The Pro Forma Financial Information, for all periods presented, includes adjustments to convert Recall's historical results from International Financial Reporting Standards to GAAP, our current estimates of purchase accounting adjustments (including amortization expenses from acquired intangible assets, depreciation of acquired property, plant and equipment and amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases), stock-based compensation and related tax effects. Through   September 30, 2016  , we and Recall have collectively incurred   $137,652   of operating expenditures to complete the Recall Transaction (including advisory and professional fees and costs to complete the Divestments required in connection with receipt of regulatory approval and to provide transitional services required to support the divested businesses during a transition period). These operating expenditures have been reflected within the results of operations in the Pro Forma Financial Information as if they were incurred on January 1, 2015. The costs we have incurred to integrate Recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, REIT conversion and system upgrade costs are reflected in the Pro Forma Financial Information in the period in which they were incurred. 
  The Pro Forma Financial Information, for all periods presented, exclude from income (loss) from continuing operations the results of operations of the Initial United States Divestments, the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments, the Recall Canadian Divestments and the UK Divestments, as these businesses are presented as discontinued operations. The results of the Australia Divestment Business and the Iron Mountain Canadian Divestments are included within the results from continuing operations in the Pro Forma Financial Information for all periods presented, as these businesses do not qualify for discontinued operations. The Australia Divestment Business and the Iron Mountain Canadian Divestments, collectively, represent   $23,317   and   $50,759   of total revenues and   $3,595   and   $5,146   of total income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and   $15,803   and   $42,954   of total revenues and   $1,986   and   $2,741   of total income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.    

  The amount of revenue and earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to Recall is impracticable for us to determine. Subsequent to the closing of the Recall Transaction, we began integrating Recall and our existing operations in order to achieve operational synergies. As a result, the revenue generated by Recall, as well as the underlying costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses to support Recall's business, are now integrated with the revenue we generate, as well as the costs of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses that supported our business, prior to the acquisition of Recall.

In addition to our acquisition of Recall, we completed certain other acquisitions during 2016. The unaudited pro forma results of operations (including revenue and earnings) for the current and prior periods reflecting these acquisitions and certain acquisitions in 2015 are not presented due to the insignificant impact of these acquisitions on our consolidated results of operations.   
    
  b.  Other 2016 Acquisitions 
    
  In March 2016, we acquired a controlling interest in Docufile Holdings Proprietary Limited ("Docufile"), a storage and records management company with operations in South Africa, for approximately   $15,000  . The acquisition of Docufile represents our entrance into Africa. 
    
  In March 2016, in order to expand our presence in the Baltic region, we acquired the stock of Archyvu Sistemos, a storage and records management company with operations in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, for approximately   $5,100  . 
    
  In August 2016, we reached an agreement in principle under a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire the information management operations of Santa Fe Group A/S ( Santa Fe ) in   ten   regions within Europe and Asia (the  Santa Fe Transaction ) for approximately   27,000   Euro, or approximately $  30,300  , based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Euro as of September 30, 2016. Santa Fe operates its information management business in Spain, India, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan. The memorandum of understanding between us and Santa Fe is non-binding and any binding agreement we enter into with Santa Fe will be subject to closing conditions; accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will complete this acquisition, that the acquisition will not be delayed or that the terms of the acquisition will not change. 
  _______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
  A summary of the cumulative consideration paid and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price paid for all of our 2016 acquisitions is as follows:

  (4) Acquisitions (Continued) 

(1) 
    Included in cash paid for acquisitions in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is net cash acquired of   $77,098   and cash received of   $182   related to acquisitions made in previous years. 
       
           (2) 
    Represents the fair value, less costs to sell, of the Initial United States Divestments, the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments, the Recall Canadian Divestments and the UK Divestments. 
       
           (3) 
    Consists primarily of buildings, racking structures, leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software.  These assets are depreciated using the straight-line method with the useful lives as noted in Note 2.f. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. 
       
           (4) 
    The weighted average lives of customer relationship intangible assets associated with acquisitions in   2016   was   14 years  , primarily related to the customer relationship intangible assets associated with the Recall Transaction. 
       
           (5) 
    The goodwill associated with Recall is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce, expanded market opportunities and costs and other operating synergies anticipated upon the integration of the operations of us and Recall.   
       
  Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions made in 2016 were based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon the finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocations of those cash flows to identifiable tangible and intangible assets, in determining the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management's best estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete the valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates. Assets and liabilities that were acquired and classified as held for sale immediately following the Recall Transaction were valued based on the estimated fair value of the divestment, less costs to sell. The preliminary purchase price allocations that are not finalized as of September 30, 2016 primarily relate to the final assessment of the fair values of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship intangible assets and trademarks), property, plant and equipment (primarily building and racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes) associated with the Recall Transaction.    
    
  As the valuation of certain assets and liabilities for purposes of purchase price allocations are preliminary in nature, they are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances regarding these assets and liabilities that existed at the acquisition date. Any adjustments to our estimates of purchase price allocation will be made in the periods in which the adjustments are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. Adjustments recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were not material to our results from operations.

a.  Credit Agreement 
  On July 2, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") to refinance our then existing credit agreement which consisted of a revolving credit facility (the "Former Revolving Credit Facility") and a term loan and was scheduled to terminate on June 27, 2016. The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a term loan (the "Term Loan"). We recorded a charge of   $2,156   to other expense (income), net in the third quarter of 2015 related to the refinancing of the Credit Agreement, representing a write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
  On June 24, 2016, Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC ( IMIM ) entered into a commitment increase supplement (the  Commitment Increase Supplement ), pursuant to which we increased the maximum amount permitted to be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility from   $1,500,000   to   $1,750,000  . After entering into the Commitment Increase Supplement, the maximum amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is   $2,000,000   (consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility of   $1,750,000   and a Term Loan of   $250,000  ). We continue to have the option to request additional commitments of up to   $250,000  , in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions specified in the Credit Agreement. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a group of   25   banks and enables IMI and certain of its United States and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros and Australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed   $1,750,000  . The Term Loan is to be paid in quarterly installments in an amount equal to   $3,125   per quarter, with the remaining balance due on July 3, 2019. The Credit Agreement terminates on July 6, 2019, at which point all obligations become due, but may be extended by one year at our option, subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time.  
  IMI and the Guarantors guarantee all obligations under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which fee ranges from between   0.25%   to   0.4%   based on our consolidated leverage ratio and fees associated with outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, we had   $1,240,761   and   $234,375   of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan, respectively. Of the   $1,240,761   of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility,   $718,800   was denominated in United States dollars,   6,000   was denominated in Canadian dollars,   255,150   was denominated in Euros and   303,000   was denominated in Australian dollars. In addition, we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling   $55,392  . The remaining amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016, based on IMI's leverage ratio, the last   12   months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR"), other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was   $453,847   (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). The average interest rate in effect under the Credit Agreement was   2.9%   as of   September 30, 2016  . The average interest rate in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was   2.9%   and ranged from   2.3%   to   4.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   and the interest rate in effect under the Term Loan as of   September 30, 2016   was   2.8%  .  
  The Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement uses EBITDAR-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.

Our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and our leverage ratio under our indentures as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively, are as follows: 

As noted in the table above, our maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement is   6.5  . The Credit Agreement also contains a provision which limits, in certain circumstances, our dividends in any four consecutive fiscal quarters to   95%   of Funds From Operations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for such four fiscal quarters or, if greater, the amount that we would be required to pay in order to continue to be qualified for taxation as a REIT or to avoid the imposition of income or excise taxes on IMI. This limitation only is applicable when our net total lease adjusted leverage ratio exceeds   6.0   as measured as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.  
  Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 
  Commitment fees and letters of credit fees, which are based on the unused balances under the Former Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program (as defined below) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   are as follows: 

b.  Bridge Facility 
  On April 19, 2016, in order to provide a portion of the financing necessary to close the Recall Transaction, we entered into a commitment letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide us an unsecured bridge term loan facility of up to   $850,000   (the "Bridge Facility"). On April 29, 2016, we entered into a bridge credit agreement (the  Bridge Credit Agreement ) with the Lenders and borrowed the full amount of the Bridge Facility. We used the proceeds from the Bridge Facility, together with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to finance a portion of the cost of the Recall Transaction, including refinancing Recall s existing indebtedness and to pay costs we incurred in connection with the Recall Transaction. 
  On May 31, 2016, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the 4  % Notes and the 5  % Notes, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to repay the Bridge Facility, and effective May 31, 2016, we terminated the commitments of the lenders under the Bridge Credit Agreement. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of   $9,283   during the second quarter of 2016 related to the early extinguishment of the Bridge Credit Agreement. This charge primarily consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

c.  Issuance of 4   3   /   8   % Notes, 5   3   /   8   % Notes and CAD Notes due 2023 
  In May 2016, IMI completed a private offering of   $500,000   in aggregate principal amount of the 4   3   /   8   % Notes and IM US Holdings completed a private offering of   $250,000   in aggregate principal amount of the 5   3   /   8   % Notes. The 4   3   /   8   % Notes and 5   3   /   8   % Notes were issued at par. The aggregate net proceeds of   $738,750   from the 4   3   /   8   % Notes and 5   3   /   8   % Notes, after paying the initial purchasers' commissions, were used, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, for the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. 
  On September 15, 2016, Canada Company completed a private offering of   250,000   Canadian dollars in aggregate principal amount of the CAD Notes due 2023. The CAD Notes due 2023 were issued at par. The aggregate net proceeds from the CAD Notes due 2023 of   246,250   Canadian dollars (or   $186,693  , based upon the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the United States dollar on September 15, 2016 (the settlement date for the CAD Notes due 2023)), after paying the initial purchasers  commissions, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
  d. Australian Dollar Term Loan 
  On September 28, 2016, Iron Mountain Australia Group Pty, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of IMI, entered into a   250,000   Australian dollar Syndicated Term Loan B Facility (the  AUD Term Loan ) which matures in September 2022. The AUD Term Loan was issued at   99%   of par. The net proceeds of approximately   243,750   Australian dollars (or approximately   $185,800  , based upon the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar on September 28, 2016 (the settlement date for the AUD Term Loan)), after paying commissions to the joint lead arrangers and net of the original discount, were used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility in October 2016 and for general corporate purposes. 
  Principal payments on the AUD Term Loan are to be paid in quarterly installments in an amount equivalent to   6,250   Australian dollars per year, with the remaining balance due on September 28, 2022. The AUD Term Loan is secured by substantially all assets of Iron Mountain Australia Group Pty. Ltd. IMI and the Guarantors guarantee all obligations under the AUD Term Loan. The interest rate on borrowings under the AUD Term Loan is based upon BBSY (an Australian benchmark variable interest rate) plus   4.3%  . As of September 30, 2016, we had   250,000   Australian dollars outstanding on the AUD Term Loan and the interest rate in effect under the AUD Term Loan was   6.1%  .

e.  Accounts Receivable Securitization Program 
  In March 2015, we entered into a   $250,000   accounts receivable securitization program (the "Accounts Receivable Securitization Program") involving several of our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain financial institutions. Under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, certain of our subsidiaries sell substantially all of their United States accounts receivable balances to our wholly owned special purpose entities, Iron Mountain Receivables QRS, LLC and Iron Mountain Receivables TRS, LLC (the "Special Purpose Subsidiaries"). The Special Purpose Subsidiaries use the accounts receivable balances to collateralize loans obtained from certain financial institutions. The Special Purpose Subsidiaries are consolidated subsidiaries of IMI. The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program is accounted for as a collateralized financing activity, rather than a sale of assets, and therefore: (i) accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral are presented as assets and borrowings are presented as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, (ii) our Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the associated charges for bad debt expense related to pledged accounts receivable (a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) and reductions to revenue due to billing and service related credit memos issued to customers and related reserves, as well as interest expense associated with the collateralized borrowings, and (iii) receipts from customers related to the underlying accounts receivable are reflected as operating cash flows and borrowings and repayments under the collateralized loans are reflected as financing cash flows within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. IMIM retains the responsibility of servicing the accounts receivable balances pledged as collateral in this transaction and IMI provides a performance guaranty. The Accounts Receivable Securitization Program terminates on March 6, 2018, at which point all obligations become due. The maximum availability allowed is limited by eligible accounts receivable, as defined under the terms of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum availability allowed and amount outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was $  208,800  . The interest rate in effect under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program was   1.4%   as of   September 30, 2016  . Commitment fees at a rate of 40 basis points are charged on amounts made available but not borrowed under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. 
  f. Cash Pooling 
  Subsequent to the closing of the Recall Transaction, certain of our international subsidiaries began participating in a cash pooling arrangement (the  Cash Pool ) with Bank Mendes Gans ( BMG ) in order to help manage global liquidity requirements. The Cash Pool allows participating subsidiaries to borrow funds from BMG against amounts held on deposit with BMG by other participating subsidiaries. The Cash Pool has a legal right of offset and, therefore, amounts are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis. Each subsidiary receives interest on the cash balances held on deposit or pays interest on the amounts owed based on an applicable rate as defined in the Cash Pool agreement. At September 30, 2016, we had a net cash position of approximately   $18,900   (consisting of a gross cash position of approximately   $50,700   less outstanding borrowings of approximately   $31,800   by participating subsidiaries), which is reflected as cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

  (6) Selected Consolidated Financial Statements of Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company and Non-Guarantors  

The following data summarizes the consolidating results of IMI on the equity method of accounting as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and   2016   and are prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements. 
  The Parent Notes, the CAD Notes, GBP Notes and the 5   3   /   8   % Notes are guaranteed by the subsidiaries referred to below as the Guarantors. These subsidiaries are   100%   owned by IMI. The guarantees are full and unconditional, as well as joint and several.  
  Additionally, IMI guarantees the CAD Notes, which were issued by Canada Company, the GBP Notes, which were issued by IME, and the 5   3   /   8   % Notes, which were issued by IM US Holdings. Canada Company and IME do not guarantee the Parent Notes. The subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Parent Notes, the CAD Notes, the GBP Notes and the 5   3   /   8   % Notes, including IME and the Special Purpose Subsidiaries but excluding Canada Company, are referred to below as the Non-Guarantors. 
  In the normal course of business, we periodically change the ownership structure of our subsidiaries to meet the requirements of our business. In the event of such changes, we recast the prior period financial information within this footnote to conform to the current period presentation in the period such changes occur. Generally, these changes do not alter the designation of the underlying subsidiaries as Guarantors or Non-Guarantors. However, they may change whether the underlying subsidiary is owned by the Parent, a Guarantor, Canada Company or a Non-Guarantor. If such a change occurs, the amount of investment in subsidiaries in the below Consolidated Balance Sheets and equity in the earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net of tax in the below Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income with respect to the relevant Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company, Non-Guarantors and Eliminations columns also would change.  
  In July 2016, certain Non-Guarantor subsidiaries which were originally established at the time of our acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts ( Crozier ) in December 2015 (the  Crozier Entities ), were merged into IMIM, a Guarantor and a substantive operating entity (the  Crozier Merger ). As a result of the Crozier Merger, (i) the assets, liabilities and equity of the Crozier Entities are now reported in the Guarantor column of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016; (ii) the revenues and expenses of the Crozier Entities are now reported in the Guarantor column in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016; and (iii) the cash flows of the Crozier Entities are now reported in the Guarantor column in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We have recast the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 to conform to the current period presentation of the Crozier Entities. We acquired Crozier in December 2015; therefore, the Crozier Merger had no impact on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

  (7) Segment Information  

During the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of changes in the senior management of our business in Norway, we determined that our Norway operations are now being managed as a component of our Other International Business segment rather than as a component of our Western European Business segment. As a result of this change, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation. There were no changes to our operating segments or our reportable operating segments as a result of the Recall Transaction.  
  Our   five   reportable operating segments are described as follows: 
             
    North American Records and Information Management Business provides records and information management services, including the storage of physical records, including media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ( Records Management  information destruction services ( Destruction  and DMS throughout the United States and Canada; as well as fulfillment services and technology escrow services in the United States.   
                
    North American Data Management Business provides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ( Data Protection   Recovery  server and computer backup services; digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets; and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients, throughout the United States and Canada.  
                
    Western European Business provides records and information management services, including Records Management, Data Protection   Recovery and DMS throughout Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, as well as DMS in Sweden.  
                
    Other International Business provides records and information management services throughout the remaining European countries in which we operate, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa, including Records Management, Data Protection   Recovery and DMS. Our European operations provide records and information management services, including Records Management, Data Protection   Recovery and DMS throughout the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and Ukraine; Records Management and DMS in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; and Records Management in Sweden. Our Latin America operations provide records and information management services, including Records Management, Data Protection   Recovery, Destruction and DMS throughout Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Our Asia Pacific operations provide records and information management services, including Records Management, Data Protection   Recovery and DMS throughout Australia and New Zealand, with Records Management and Data Protection   Recovery also provided in certain markets in China, Hong Kong-SAR, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Our African operations provide Records Management, Data Protection   Recovery, and DMS in South Africa. 
                
    Corporate and Other Business primarily consists of our data center and fine art storage businesses in the United States, the primary product offerings of our Adjacent Businesses operating segment, as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Our Corporate and Other Business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all Employee Stock-Based Awards.

    Excludes all intercompany receivables or payables and investment in subsidiary balances. 

(3) 
    Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired for the Other International Business segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consists of the cash component of the purchase price for the Recall Transaction, as the IMI entity that made the cash payment was an Australian subsidiary. However, the Recall Transaction also benefited the North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business and Western European Business segments.    
     The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report. Adjusted OIBDA for each segment is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net, costs associated with our conversion to a REIT, excluding REIT compliance costs beginning January 1, 2014 which we expect to recur in future periods ("REIT Costs") and Recall Costs (as defined below) directly attributable to the segment. Internally, we use Adjusted OIBDA as the basis for evaluating the performance of, and allocating resources to, our operating segments.  
  A reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and gain on sale of real estate is as follows: 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    Includes operating expenditures associated with our acquisition of Recall, including operating expenditures to complete the Recall Transaction, including advisory and professional fees and costs to complete the Divestments required in connection with receipt of regulatory approval and to provide transitional services required to support the divested businesses during a transition period ("Recall Deal Close   Divestment Costs"), as well as operating expenditures to integrate Recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, REIT conversion and system upgrade costs ("Recall Integration Costs" and, collectively with Recall Deal Close   Divestment Costs, "Recall Costs").

  (8) Commitments and Contingencies 

a.    Litigation General 
  We are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from third parties. The matters described below represent our significant loss contingencies. We have evaluated each matter and, if both probable and estimable, accrued an amount that represents our estimate of any probable loss associated with such matter. In addition, we have estimated a reasonably possible range for all loss contingencies including those described below. We believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur aggregate losses in addition to amounts currently accrued for all matters up to an additional   $21,000   over the next several years, of which certain amounts would be covered by insurance or indemnity arrangements. 
  b.  Italy Fire 
  On November 4, 2011, we experienced a fire at a facility we leased in Aprilia, Italy. The facility primarily stored archival and inactive business records for local area businesses. Despite quick response by local fire authorities, damage to the building was extensive, and the building and its contents were a total loss. We have been sued by   five   customers.   Four   of those lawsuits have been settled and   one  , a claim asserted by Azienda per i Transporti Autoferrotranviari del Comune di Roma, S.p.A, seeking   42,600   Euros for the loss of its current and historical archives, remains pending. We have also received correspondence from other affected customers, including certain customers demanding payment under various theories of liability. Although our warehouse legal liability insurer has reserved its rights to contest coverage related to certain types of potential claims, we believe we carry adequate insurance. We deny any liability with respect to the fire and we have referred these claims to our warehouse legal liability insurer for an appropriate response. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We sold our Italian operations on April 27, 2012, and we indemnified the buyers related to certain obligations and contingencies associated with the fire. As a result of the sale of the Italian operations, any future statement of operations and cash flow impacts related to the fire will be reflected as discontinued operations. 
  c.  Argentina Fire 
  On February 5, 2014, we experienced a fire at a facility we own in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a result of the quick response by local fire authorities, the fire was contained before the entire facility was destroyed, and all employees were safely evacuated; however, a number of first responders lost their lives, or in some cases, were severely injured. The cause of the fire is currently being investigated. We believe we carry adequate insurance and do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Revenues from our operations at this facility represent less than   0.5%   of our consolidated revenues. 
  d. Brooklyn Fire (Recall) 
  On January 31, 2015, a former Recall leased facility located in Brooklyn, New York was completely destroyed by a fire. Approximately   900,000   cartons were lost impacting approximately   1,200   customers. No one was injured as a result of the fire. We believe we carry adequate insurance to cover any losses resulting from the fire. There are   three   pending customer-related lawsuits stemming from the fire, which are being defended by our warehouse legal liability insurer. We have also received correspondence from other customers, under various theories of liability. We deny any liability with respect to the fire and we have referred these claims to our insurer for an appropriate response. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

e.  Roye Fire (Recall) 
    
  On January 28, 2002, a former leased Recall records management facility located in Roye, France was destroyed by a fire. Local French authorities conducted an investigation relating to the fire and issued a charge of criminal negligence against us. We intend to defend this matter vigorously. We are currently corresponding with various customers impacted by the fire who are seeking payment under various theories of liability. There is also pending civil litigation with the owner of the destroyed facility, who is demanding payment for lost rental income and other items. Based on known and expected claims and our expectation of the ultimate outcome of those claims, we believe we carry adequate insurance coverage. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  (9) Stockholders' Equity Matters 
  Our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The amount and timing of future dividends will continue to be subject to the approval of our board of directors, in its sole discretion, and to applicable legal requirements.  
  In fiscal year   2015   and in the first   nine   months of   2016  , our board of directors declared the following dividends: 

(10) Divestments 
  As disclosed in Note 4, in connection with the acquisition of Recall, we sought regulatory approval of the Recall Transaction from the DOJ, the ACCC, the CCB and the CMA and, as part of the regulatory approval process, we agreed to make the Divestments.  
  The assets and liabilities related to the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments, the Australia Divestment Business, the Canadian Divestments and the UK Divestments are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . The assets and liabilities related to the Initial United States Divestments were sold to Access CIG in the Access Sale on May 4, 2016.  
  The following provides additional information regarding (a) the assets and liabilities related to the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments, the Australia Divestment Business, the Canadian Divestments and the UK Divestments (collectively, the  Divestments Held for Sale ), each of which are classified as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning in the second quarter of 2016; and (b) the presentation of the Divestments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively, and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively.

a.  Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale 
    
  We have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the assets and liabilities related to the Divestments Held for Sale meet the criteria to be reported as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Our assets and liabilities held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   are comprised of the following: 

The assets and liabilities associated with the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments and the Canadian Divestments are included in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment. The assets and liabilities associated with the Australia Divestment Business are included in our Other International Business segment. The assets and liabilities associated with the UK Divestments are included in our Western European Business segment. 
    
           b. 
    Presentation of Divestments in Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  
       
  We have concluded that the Australian Divestment Business and the Iron Mountain Canadian Divestments (collectively, the  Iron Mountain Divestments ) do not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively, and in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively, as our decision to divest these businesses does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the revenues and expenses associated with the Iron Mountain Divestments are included as a component of income (loss) from continuing operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively, and the cash flows associated with these businesses are included as a component of cash flows from continuing operations in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and 2016, respectively.

  (10) Divestments (Continued) 

We have concluded that the Initial United States Divestments, the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments, the Recall Canadian Divestments, and the UK Divestments (collectively, the  Recall Divestments ) meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as the Recall Divestments met the criteria to be reported as assets and liabilities held for sale at, or within a short period of time following, the closing of the Recall Transaction.  
  The table below summarizes certain results of operations of the Recall Divestments: 

______________________________________________________________________________ 
    
           (1) 
    The Access Sale occurred nearly simultaneously with the closing of the Recall Transaction. Accordingly, the revenue and expenses associated with the Initial United States Divestments are not included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and the cash flows associated with the Initial United States Divestments are not included in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to the immaterial nature of the revenues, expenses and cash flows related to the Initial United States Divestments for the period of time we owned these businesses (May 2, 2016 through May 4, 2016).

  (11) Transformation Initiative 

During the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to reduce our overhead costs, particularly in our developed markets, in order to optimize our selling, general and administrative cost structure and to support investments to advance our growth strategy (the  Transformation Initiative ), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. As a result of the Transformation Initiative, we recorded a charge of   $9,080   for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and a charge of   $188   and   $6,007   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Costs included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows:  

Costs recorded by segment associated with the Transformation Initiative are as follows: 

Through   September 30, 2016  , we have recorded cumulative charges to our Consolidated Statements of Operations associated with the Transformation Initiative of   $16,174  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had accrued   $751   related to the Transformation Initiative. We expect that this liability will be paid throughout the remainder of 2016.

  In October 2016, we entered into a   $50,000   mortgage securitization program (the "Mortgage Securitization Program") involving certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries with Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company ( Goldman Sachs ). Under the Mortgage Securitization Program, IMIM contributed certain real estate assets to its wholly owned special purpose entity, Iron Mountain Mortgage Finance I, LLC (the "Mortgage Special Purpose Subsidiary"). The Mortgage Special Purpose Subsidiary then used the real estate to secure collateralized loans from Goldman Sachs. The Mortgage Special Purpose Subsidiary is a consolidated subsidiary of IMI. Borrowings under the Mortgage Securitization Program bear interest at   3.5%  . The Mortgage Securitization Program is scheduled to terminate in November 2026. Proceeds from the Mortgage Securitization Program will be used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Australia Sale 
  On October 31, 2016, after receiving approval of the proposed transaction from the ACCC, we completed the sale of the Australia Divestment Business (the  Australia Sale ) to a consortium led by Housatonic Partners (the  Buyers ) for total consideration of approximately   70,000   Australian dollars (or approximately   $53,200  , based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Australian dollar as of October 31, 2016), subject to adjustments. The purchase price consists of (i)   35,000   Australian dollars in cash received upon the closing of the Australia Sale and (ii)   35,000   Australian dollars in the form of a note due from the Buyers to us (the  Bridging Loan Note ). The Bridging Loan Note bears interest at   3.3%   per annum and matures on December 29, 2017, at which point all outstanding obligations become due. The purchase price for the Australia Sale is subject to certain adjustments, including a working capital adjustment and adjustments associated with customer attrition subsequent to the closing of the Australia Sale. We recorded a charge of   $14,000   associated with the anticipated loss on disposal of the Australia Divestment Business during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, representing the excess of the carrying value of the Australia Divestment Business compared to its fair value (less costs to sell) as of September 30, 2016, based upon the sale price described above.

  Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , included herein, and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 26, 2016 (our "Annual Report"). 
   
  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  We have made statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report") that constitute "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our operations, economic performance, financial condition, goals, beliefs, future growth strategies, investment objectives, plans and current expectations, such as our (1) commitment to future dividend payments, (2) expected   2016   consolidated internal revenue growth rate and capital expenditures, (3) statements made in relation to our acquisition of Recall Holdings Limited ("Recall") pursuant to the Scheme Implementation Deed, as amended, with Recall (the "Recall Transaction") including (i) the total cost to integrate the combined companies and (ii) the expected proceeds from the Divestments (as defined in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report) associated with the Recall Transaction and (4) expected cost savings associated with the Transformation Initiative (as defined below). These forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. In addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others: 
             
    our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes ("REIT"); 
                
    the adoption of alternative technologies and shifts by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies; 
                
    changes in customer preferences and demand for our storage and information management services; 
                
    the cost to comply with current and future laws, regulations and customer demands relating to privacy issues, as well as fire and safety standards; 
                
    the impact of litigation or disputes that may arise in connection with incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information; 
                
    changes in the price for our storage and information management services relative to the cost of providing such storage and information management services; 
                
    changes in the political and economic environments in the countries in which our international subsidiaries operate; 
                
    our ability or inability to complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and to integrate acquired companies efficiently; 
                
    changes in the amount of our capital expenditures; 
                
    changes in the cost of our debt; 
                
    the impact of alternative, more attractive investments on dividends; 
                
    the cost or potential liabilities associated with real estate necessary for our business; 
                
    the performance of business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management expertise outside the United States; 
                
    changes in the valuation of records and information businesses which could impact the proceeds we will receive from the Divestments; and 
                
    other trends in competitive or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of operations not presently contemplated. 
     You should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. You should read these cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures we have made in this Quarterly Report, as well as our other periodic reports filed with the SEC including under "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on April 28, 2016 and in our Annual Report.

Overview 
  The following discussions set forth, for the periods indicated, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Significant trends and changes are discussed for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   within each section. Trends and changes that are consistent with the   three and nine   month periods are not repeated and are discussed on a year to date basis.  
  Recall Acquisition 
  On May 2, 2016 (Sydney, Australia time), we completed the Recall Transaction. At the closing of the Recall Transaction, we paid approximately   $331.8 million   and issued approximately   50.2 million   shares of our common stock which, based upon the closing price of our common stock as of April 29, 2016 (the last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction) of $36.53 per share, resulted in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately   $2,166.9 million  . 
  We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values and the results of operations for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. With respect to the acquisition of Recall, the results of operations of Recall have been included in our consolidated results from May 2, 2016. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for unaudited pro forma results of operations for us and Recall, as if the Recall Transaction was completed on January 1, 2015, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   2015 and 2016, respectively. 
  We currently estimate total operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction to be approximately $380.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred by the end of 2018. This amount consists of (i) approximately $80.0 million of operating expenditures to complete the Recall Transaction, including advisory and professional fees and costs to complete the Divestments required in connection with receipt of regulatory approval and to provide transitional services required to support the divested businesses during a transition period ( Recall Deal Close   Divestment Costs ), (ii) approximately $220.0 million of operating expenditures to integrate Recall with our existing operations, including moving, severance, facility upgrade, REIT conversion and system upgrade costs ( Recall Integration Costs  and, collectively with Recall Deal Close   Divestment Costs,  Recall Costs ) and (iii) approximately $80.0 million of capital expenditures to integrate Recall with our existing operations. From January 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  , we have incurred cumulative operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction of $156.9 million, including $149.9 million of Recall Costs and $7.0 million of capital expenditures.  
  See Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for more information on Recall Costs, including costs recorded by segment as well as recorded between cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Transformation Initiative 
  During the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to reduce our overhead costs, particularly in our developed markets, in order to optimize our selling, general and administrative cost structure and to support investments to advance our growth strategy (the "Transformation Initiative"), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. As a result of the Transformation Initiative, we recorded a charge of   $0.2 million   and   $6.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and a charge of $9.1 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. See Note 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for more information on costs related to the Transformation Initiative, including costs recorded by segment as well as between cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.    
  As we quantify incremental costs associated with future Transformation Initiative actions to achieve our $125.0 million cost reduction goal, we will disclose the relevant cost estimates and charges in the period that such actions are approved. 
  General 
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of changes in the senior management of our business in Norway, we determined that our Norway operations are now being managed as a component of our Other International Business segment rather than as a component of our Western European Business segment. As a result of this change, previously reported segment information has been restated to conform to the current presentation. There were no changes to our operating segments or our reportable operating segments as a result of the Recall Transaction.

     Table of Contents  

Our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code. Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including document management solutions, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent removal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) the storage, assembly and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders; (9) consulting services; and (10) technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. While customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels. 
  Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation. 
    
  The expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our international operations are more labor intensive than our operations in North America and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of international segment revenue. In addition, the overhead structure of our expanding international operations has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our North American segments, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. 
    
  Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship intangible assets. Both depreciation and amortization are impacted by the timing of acquisitions. 
    
  Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the United States. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on individual balances. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2015 results at the 2016 average exchange rates. Constant currency growth rates are a non-GAAP measure.

Non-GAAP Measures 
  Adjusted OIBDA 
  Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net, Recall Costs and REIT Costs (as defined in Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report). Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs; (5) REIT Costs; (6) other expense (income), net; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (9) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business.  
  Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Adjusted EPS 
  Adjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) other expense (income), net; (5) Recall Costs; (6) REIT Costs; and (7) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. Adjusted EPS includes income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

    The difference between our effective tax rate and our structural tax rate (or adjusted effective tax rate) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   2015 and 2016, respectively, is primarily due to (i) the reconciling items above, which impact our reported income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes but have an insignificant impact on our reported provision (benefit) for income taxes and (ii) other discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for purposes of the calculation of Adjusted EPS for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   2015 and 2016 was 16.5% and 18.6%, respectively.

FFO (NAREIT) and FFO (Normalized) 
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and us as net income excluding depreciation on real estate assets and gain on sale of real estate, net of tax ( FFO (NAREIT) ). FFO (NAREIT) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (NAREIT) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (NAREIT) is net income. Although NAREIT has published a definition of FFO, modifications to FFO (NAREIT) are common among REITs as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business. Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (NAREIT) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) other expense (income), net; (4) deferred income taxes and REIT tax adjustments; (5) Recall Costs; (6) REIT Costs; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax.

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: 
             
    Revenue Recognition 
                
    Accounting for Acquisitions 
                
    Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets 
                
    Income Taxes 
     Further detail regarding our critical accounting policies can be found in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included therein. We have determined that no material changes concerning our critical accounting policies have occurred since   December 31, 2015  .

REVENUES 
  Consolidated revenues consists of the following (in thousands): 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the   2015   results at the   2016   average exchange rates. 
              (2) 
    Our internal revenue growth rate, which is a non-GAAP measure, represents the weighted average year-over-year growth rate of our revenues excluding the impact of business acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The revenues generated by Recall have been integrated with our existing revenues and it is impracticable for us to determine actual Recall revenue contribution. Therefore, our internal revenue growth rates exclude the impact of revenues associated with the Recall Transaction based upon forecasted or budgeted Recall revenues beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Our internal revenue growth rate includes the impact of acquisitions of customer relationships.   
     Consolidated storage rental revenues increased   $116.4 million  , or   25.3%  , to   $576.5 million   and   $196.2 million  , or   14.2%  , to   $1,576.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, from   $460.1 million   and   $1,380.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures and consolidated internal storage rental revenue growth were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 24.6% and 14.6% to the reported storage rental revenue growth rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, driven primarily by our acquisition of Recall. Internal storage rental revenue growth of   2.3%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same prior year period was driven by sustained internal storage rental revenue growth of   0.7%  ,   1.7%  ,   0.8%   and   9.9%   in our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and Other International Business segments, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   by 1.9% and 2.7%, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. Global records management net volumes as of   September 30, 2016   increased by 29.2% over the ending volume at   September 30, 2015  , supported by volume increases across each of our reportable operating segments, primarily associated with the acquisition of Recall.

Consolidated service revenues increased   $79.9 million  , or   27.9%  , to   $366.4 million   and   $125.5 million  , or   14.3%  , to   $1,000.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, from   $286.5 million   and   $875.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures was partially offset by negative consolidated internal service revenue growth and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 30.4% and 17.6% to the reported service revenue growth rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, driven primarily by our acquisition of Recall. Internal service revenue growth was negative   0.5%   and negative   0.2%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. The negative internal service revenue growth for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our North American Records and Information Management Business and Western European Business segments, as well as continued declines in service revenue activity levels in our North American Data Management Business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. In the North American Records and Information Management Business segment, the decline in service activities has begun to stabilize in recent periods, while service revenue declines in the Western European Business and the North American Data Management Business segments are reflecting more recent reductions in service activity levels. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported total service revenues by 2.0% and 3.1% for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. 
    
  For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased   $196.3 million  , or   26.3%  , to   $942.8 million   and   $321.7 million  , or   14.3%  , to   $2,577.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, from   $746.5 million   and   $2,255.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 26.8% and 15.8% to the reported consolidated revenue growth rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, driven primarily by our acquisition of Recall. Consolidated internal revenue growth was   1.4%   and   1.3%   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased our reported consolidated revenues by 1.9% and 2.8% in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods.

We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth rate for   2016   to be approximately 1.5% to 2.0%. During the past eight quarters, our internal storage rental revenue growth rate has ranged between 2.1% and 3.5%. Our internal storage rental revenue growth rates have been relatively stable over the past two fiscal years, as internal storage rental revenue growth for full year 2014 and 2015 were 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively. At various points in the economic cycle, internal storage rental revenue growth may be influenced by changes in pricing and volume. Within our international portfolio, the Western European Business segment is generating consistent low single-digit internal storage rental revenue growth, while the Other International Business segment is producing high single-digit internal storage rental revenue growth by capturing the first-time outsourcing trends for physical records storage and management in those markets. The internal growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the internal growth rate for storage rental revenues due to the more discretionary nature of certain services we offer, such as large special projects, and, as a commodity, the volatility of pricing for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event-driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. The internal growth rate for total service revenues over the past eight quarters reflects reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our North American Records and Information Management Business and Western European Business segments, as well as continued service declines in service revenue activity levels in our North American Data Management Business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature.

OPERATING EXPENSES 
  Cost of Sales 
  Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists of the following expenses (in thousands): 

Labor 
  Labor expenses decreased to 21.2% of consolidated revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 21.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in labor expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue was driven by a 121 basis point decrease in labor expenses associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue (11.42% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 12.63% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with wages and benefits growing at a lower rate than revenue, partially offset by a 97 basis point increase in labor expenses associated with our Other International Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue (4.90% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.93% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with increased wages and benefits.  
  Labor expenses increased to   21.8%   of consolidated revenues in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   21.5%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in labor expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue was driven by a 44 basis point increase in labor expenses associated with our Other International Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue (4.53% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 4.09% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with increased wages, a 23 basis point increase in labor expenses associated with our Corporate and Other Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue (0.37% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 0.14% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with the impact of recent acquisitions, as well as a 22 basis point increase in labor expenses associated with our Western European Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue (2.88% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 2.66% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with increased wages and benefits. These increases were partially offset by a 48 basis point decrease in labor expenses associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue (12.14% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 12.62% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with wages and benefits growing at a lower rate than revenue. Labor expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by $91.4 million, or   19.5%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Labor expenses were favorably impacted by 3.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same prior year period.

Facilities 
  Facilities expenses increased to   14.9%   of consolidated revenues in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   14.2%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in facilities expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven by a 94 basis point increase in rent expense as a percentage of consolidated revenues (7.81% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 6.87% in the comparable prior year period), partially offset by a 23 basis point decrease in other facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues (7.08% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 7.31% in the comparable prior year period). The increase in rent expense was primarily driven by the acquisition of Recall, as Recall's real estate portfolio contains a more significant proportion of leased facilities than our real estate portfolio as it existed prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction. We expect this trend in rent expense to continue through the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in other facilities costs was primarily driven by lower utilities and building maintenance costs associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, as well as lower property taxes associated with our Western European Business segment. Facilities expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by $72.8 million, or   23.4%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Facilities expenses were favorably impacted by 3.4 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same prior year period. 
  Transportation 
  Transportation expenses increased to   3.8%   of consolidated revenues in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   3.3%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven by a 31 basis point increase in third party carrier costs (1.15% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 0.84% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with our Other International Business segment, as well as a 14 basis point increase in vehicle lease and insurance costs (0.45% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 0.31% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with our Western European Business segment. Transportation expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by $23.3 million, or   31.8%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 3.2 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same prior year period. 
  Product Cost of Sales and Other 
  Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to service revenue streams, particularly project revenues, increased to   4.1%   of consolidated revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   3.8%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in product cost of sales and other was driven by a 37 basis point increase in product cost of sales and other associated with our Other International Business segment (1.17% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 0.80% in the comparable prior year period) driven by project costs. Product cost of sales and other increased by $21.9 million, or   26.2%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Product cost of sales and other were favorably impacted by 3.9 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Recall Costs 
  Recall Costs included in cost of sales were   $4.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and primarily consisted of employee severance costs.

General and Administrative 
  General and administrative expenses decreased to   14.4%   of consolidated revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   15.8%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven by a 52 basis point decrease in professional fees (1.30% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.82% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business, Western European Business and Corporate and Other Business segments and a 36 basis point decrease in compensation expense (9.62% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 9.98% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with wages and benefits growing at a lower rate than revenue, as well as a 26 basis point decrease in employee related expenses (1.12% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.38% in the comparable prior year period), primarily due to decreased travel and entertainment expenses associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment. General and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by $25.1 million, or   7.2%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by 2.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Sales, Marketing   Account Management 
  S  ales, marketing and account management expenses decreased to   6.8%   of consolidated revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   7.1%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in sales, marketing and account management expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven by a 36 basis point decrease in sales, marketing and account management expenses in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment (3.21% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 3.57% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with compensation growing at a lower rate than revenue and lower professional fees. Sales, marketing and account management expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by $17.9 million, or   11.4%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were favorably impacted by 2.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Information Technology 
  Information technology expenses increased to   3.4%   of consolidated revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   3.3%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in information technology expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues was driven by a 16 basis point increase in information technology expenses associated with our Corporate and Other Business segment as a percentage of consolidated revenues (2.16% in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 2.00% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with increased software maintenance and license fees. Information technology expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased by $13.3 million, or   18.0%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 2.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Bad Debt Expense 
  Consolidated bad debt expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   0.2%   of consolidated revenues during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.7%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Bad debt expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased by $9.8 million, or   63.0%  , on a constant dollar basis compared to the same prior year period. This decrease in bad debt expense was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. We continue to monitor our customers' payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. 
  Recall Costs 
  Recall Costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were   $98.1 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and primarily consisted of advisory and professional fees, as well as severance and REIT conversion costs. Recall Costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses were   $20.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , and primarily consisted of advisory and professional fees. 
  Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Real Estate), Net 
  Depreciation expense increased $40.8 million, or 18.0%, on a reported dollar basis ($45.5 million, or 20.5%, on a constant dollar basis) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the increased depreciation of property, plant and equipment acquired in the Recall Transaction. In particular, the increase in depreciation expense was driven by (i) the depreciation of leasehold improvements acquired in the Recall Transaction, which are depreciated using the straight-line method over a period of the useful life of the leasehold improvements, 10 years or the life of the lease (whichever is shorter) and (ii) the depreciation of racking structures included in leased facilities acquired in the Recall Transaction, which are depreciated using the straight-line method over a period of the useful life of the racking structures, 20 years or the life of the lease (whichever is shorter). See Note 2.f. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report for additional information regarding the useful lives over which our property, plant and equipment is depreciated.  
  Amortization expense increased $26.1 million, or 78.0%, on a reported dollar basis ($27.4 million, or 84.9%, on a constant dollar basis) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the increased amortization of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in the Recall Transaction, which are amortized over a weighted average useful life of 14 years. 
  Consolidated gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net was   $1.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and consisted primarily of gains associated with the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment. Consolidated loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net was   $0.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and consisted primarily of the write-off of certain property associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment.

OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED OIBDA (in thousands) 
  The following table reflects the effect of the foregoing factors on our consolidated operating income and Adjusted OIBDA: 

OTHER EXPENSES, NET 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Consolidated interest expense, net increased $18.2 million to   $83.3 million   (8.8% of consolidated revenues) and $29.1 million to   $225.2 million   (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, from   $65.1 million   (8.7% of consolidated revenues) and   $196.1 million   (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily due to (i) the issuance of $1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "6% Notes due 2020") by Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") in September 2015, (ii) $850.0 million of borrowings under the Bridge Facility (as defined below) during the second quarter of 2016, (iii) the issuance of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4   3   /   8   % Senior Notes due 2021 (the "4   3   /   8   % Notes") by IMI in May 2016, (iv) the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5   3   /   8   % Senior Notes due 2026 (the "5   3   /   8   % Notes") by Iron Mountain US Holdings, Inc. ("IM US Holdings") in May 2016 and (v) higher borrowings (on a weighted average basis) under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was partially offset by the redemption in October 2015 of (i) 255.0 million Euro aggregate principal outstanding of the 6   3   /   4   % Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, (ii) $400.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of the 7   3   /   4   % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 and (iii) the remaining $106.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of the 8   3   /   8   % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021. Our weighted average interest rate was 5.1% and 5.8% at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Other Expense (Income), Net (in thousands) 

We recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of   $15.3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , based on period-end exchange rates. These losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Argentine peso and British pound sterling against the United States dollar compared to   December 31, 2015  , as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Latin American and European subsidiaries, as well as Euro denominated borrowings by IMI under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). These losses were partially offset by gains primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Brazilian real, Euro and Russian ruble against the United States dollar compared to December 31, 2015, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Latin American and European subsidiaries. 
  We recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of   $56.5 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , based on period-end exchange rates. These losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Euro, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia against the United States dollar compared to December 31, 2014, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Latin American and European subsidiaries, as well as Euro forward contracts. These losses were partially offset by gains primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling as it relates to our intercompany balances with and between our European subsidiaries, and Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI. 
    
  We recorded a charge of approximately $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 related to the refinancing of the Credit Agreement (as defined below), representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We recorded a charge of approximately $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2016 related to the termination of the Bridge Facility (as defined below), which primarily consists of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
    
  Other, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a charge of $14.0 million associated with the anticipated loss on disposal of the Australia Divestment Business (as defined in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report). As disclosed in Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have determined that the Australia Divestment Business met the criteria to be reported as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Australia Divestment Business is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value (less costs to sell). This charge represents the excess of the carrying value of the Australia Divestment Business compared to its fair value (less costs to sell) as of September 30, 2016, based upon the sale price of the business described more fully in Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of $0.6 million related to the write-down of certain investments. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  We provide for income taxes during interim periods based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in our estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period they occur. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qualified REIT subsidiaries and our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), as well as among the jurisdictions in which we operate; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and losses; (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize net operating losses that we generate.

     Table of Contents  

Our effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   14.3%   and   18.6%  , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 were   81.2%   and   46.2%  , respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of   35.0%   and our overall effective tax rates in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction, differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of   $4.1   million related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and an out-of-period tax adjustment (  $9.0   million tax benefit) to correct the valuation of certain deferred tax assets associated with the REIT conversion that occurred in 2014. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory tax rate of   35.0%   and our overall effective tax rates in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were the benefit derived from the dividends paid deduction, differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, and the impact of the $14.0 million charge (described in Note 2.i. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) recorded during the third quarter of 2016 related to the anticipated loss on disposal of the Australia Divestment Business, which had no associated tax benefit. 
  As a REIT, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of federal income tax expense, and substantially all of our income tax expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic TRSs. 
  Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net of Tax 
  Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $0.3 million  , net of tax of $0.1 million, associated with the sale of land in North America. Consolidated gain on sale of real estate was $  0.9   million, net of tax of   $0.2 million  , for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was associated with the sale of a building in the United Kingdom.

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , reported revenue in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment increased   13.3%   and   7.0%  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures and internal revenue growth were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 12.9% and 6.8% to the reported revenue growth rates in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. The internal revenue growth in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of internal service revenue growth of   0.9%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, which was driven by special project revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2016. The negative internal service revenue growth of 0.8% in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a decrease in special project revenue in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same prior year period. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Records and Information Management Business segment by 0.6% compared to the same prior year period due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 20 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by a 228 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of segment revenue (14.67% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 16.95% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with wages and benefits growing at a lower rate than revenue and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by a 210 basis point increase in cost of sales as a percentage of segment revenue (45.42% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 43.32% in the comparable prior year period), primarily driven by increased wages and benefits, rent expense and building maintenance costs. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased 40 basis points during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by a 153 basis point increase in cost of sales as a percentage of segment revenue (45.00% in the nine months ended

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , reported revenue in our North American Data Management Business segment increased   10.4%   and   4.4%  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015. In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures was partially offset by negative internal revenue growth and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015. The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 12.7% and 7.3% to the reported revenue growth rates in our North American Data Management Business segment for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. The negative internal revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to negative internal service revenue growth of   11.3%   and   10.7%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which was due to continued declines in service revenue activity levels as the business becomes more archival in nature, partially offset by internal storage rental revenue growth of   2.2%   and 1.7% in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Data Management Business segment by 0.3% compared to the same prior year period due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 370 basis points during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by a 348 basis point decrease in overhead expenses as a percentage of segment revenue (17.05% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 20.53% in the comparable prior year period), primarily driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses.

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , reported revenue in our Western European Business segment increased   24.0%   and   13.0%  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures was partially offset by negative internal revenue growth and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 37.1% and 21.2% to the reported revenue growth rates in our Western European Business segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Internal revenue growth for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was negative   1.3%  , primarily attributable to negative internal service revenue growth of   4.6%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was due to reduced retrieval/refile activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues, partially offset by   0.8%   internal storage rental revenue growth in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the Western European Business segment by 13.1% and 6.9%, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods due to the weakening of the British pound sterling against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased 50 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by a 536 basis point increase in cost of sales as a percentage of segment revenue (46.72% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 41.36% in the comparable prior year period), primarily driven by increased wages and benefits and rent expense, partially offset by a 483 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of segment revenue (22.71% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 27.54% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with wages and benefits growing at a lower rate than revenue. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 130 basis points during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily driven by a 458 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of segment revenues (24.18% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 28.76% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with lower professional fees, as well as wages and benefits growing at a lower rate than revenues, partially offset by a 329 basis point increase in cost of sales as a percentage of segment revenues (45.13% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 41.84% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with higher wages and rent expense.

  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , reported revenue in our Other International Business segment increased   90.7%   and   46.2%  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the net impact of acquisitions/divestitures and internal revenue growth were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net impact of acquisitions/divestitures contributed 84.4% and 52.0% to the reported revenue growth rates in our Other International Business segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, primarily driven by our acquisition of Recall. Internal revenue growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   9.7%   and   9.0%  , respectively, supported by   11.6%   and   9.9%   storage rental internal revenue growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Foreign currency fluctuations in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted in decreased revenue, as measured in United States dollars, of approximately 14.8% as compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar and Brazilian real against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 540 basis points during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily a result of a 415 basis point decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of segment revenues (21.98% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 26.13% in the comparable prior year period) and a 125 basis point decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of segment revenue (52.73% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 53.98% in the comparable prior year period), primarily associated with compensation expenses growing at a lower rate than revenue, as well as lower professional fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was   $419.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $320.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The $98.9 million period over period increase in cash flows from operating activities resulted from a decrease in cash used in working capital of $100.3 million, primarily related to the timing of accrued expenses and deferred revenue, offset by a decrease in net income (including non-cash charges and realized foreign exchange losses) of $1.4 million. 
  Our business requires capital expenditures to maintain our ongoing operations, support our expected revenue growth and new products and services, and increase our profitability. These expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. Our capital goes to support business-line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, acquisition of customer relationships and customer inducements during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   amounted to   $246.0 million  ,   $24.8 million   and   $16.1 million  , respectively. Cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $276.4 million   consisted primarily of the cash portion of the purchase price associated with the Recall Transaction. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , these expenditures were primarily funded with cash flows from operations, as well as the financing activities described below. Net proceeds from divestments received during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $54.0 million   consisted of the net cash proceeds from the Access Sale (as defined in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report). Excluding capital expenditures associated with potential future acquisitions and opportunistic real estate investments, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $320.0 million in the year ending   December 31, 2016  . We expect to spend up to $50.0 million of additional capital expenditures on opportunistic real estate investments in the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was   $441.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we received net proceeds of   $925.4 million   associated with the issuance of the 4   3   /   8   % Notes, 5   3   /   8   % Notes and the CAD Notes due 2023 and   $185.8 million   of proceeds from the AUD Term Loan (as defined below). We used the proceeds from these transactions, as well as cash flows provided by operating activities, for the net payment of $318.8 million associated with net payments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Bridge Facility, as well as for the payment of dividends in the amount of   $360.5 million   on our common stock.

  Financial Instruments and Debt 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including time deposits) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of   September 30, 2016   relate to cash and cash equivalents held in time deposits with   six   global banks, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents balance was   $458.1 million  , including time deposits amounting to   $18.7 million  .

These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Canada Company, Iron Mountain Europe PLC ("IME"), the Special Purpose Subsidiaries (as defined in Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes.

  a. Credit Agreement 
    
  On July 2, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") to refinance our then existing credit agreement that was scheduled to terminate on June 27, 2016. The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a term loan (the "Term Loan"). We recorded a charge of approximately $2.2 million to other expense (income), net in the third quarter of 2015 related to the refinancing of the Credit Agreement, representing a write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.  
    
  On June 24, 2016, Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC ( IMIM ) entered into a commitment increase supplement (the  Commitment Increase Supplement ), pursuant to which we increased the maximum amount permitted to be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility from   $1,500.0 million   to   $1,750.0 million  . After entering into the Commitment Increase Supplement, the maximum amount available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is   $2,000.0 million   (consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility of   $1,750.0 million   and a Term Loan of   $250.0 million  ). We continue to have the option to request additional commitments of up to   $250.0 million  , in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions specified in the Credit Agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,240.8 million   and   $234.4 million   of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan, respectively, and   $55.4 million   of various letters of credit outstanding. The remaining amount available for borrowing thereunder, based on IMI's leverage ratio, the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR"), other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was   $453.8 million   (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). The average interest rate in effect under the Credit Agreement was   2.9%   as of   September 30, 2016  . The average interest rate in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was   2.9%   and ranged from   2.3%   to   4.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   and the interest rate in effect under the Term Loan as of   September 30, 2016   was   2.8%  .  
  The Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement uses EBITDAR-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.   
  Our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the Credit Agreement as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and our leverage ratio under our indentures as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016  , respectively, are as follows: 

85 

     Table of Contents  

As noted in the table above, our maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement is 6.5. The Credit Agreement also contains a provision which limits, in certain circumstances, our dividends in any four consecutive fiscal quarters to 95% of Funds From Operations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for such four fiscal quarters or, if greater, the amount that we would be required to pay in order to continue to be qualified for taxation as a REIT or to avoid the imposition of income or excise taxes on IMI. This limitation only is applicable when our net total lease adjusted leverage ratio exceeds 6.0 as measured as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.  
  Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 
  b. Bridge Facility 
  On April 19, 2016, in order to provide a portion of the financing necessary to close the Recall Transaction, we entered into a commitment letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as a lender and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide us an unsecured bridge term loan facility of up to $850.0 million (the "Bridge Facility"). On April 29, 2016, we entered into a bridge credit agreement (the  Bridge Credit Agreement ) with the Lenders and borrowed the full amount of the Bridge Facility. We used the proceeds from the Bridge Facility, together with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to finance a portion of the cost of the Recall Transaction, including refinancing Recall s existing indebtedness and to pay costs we incurred in connection with the Recall Transaction. 
    
  On May 31, 2016, we used the proceeds from the issuance of the 4   3   /   8   % Notes and the 5   3   /   8   % Notes, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to repay the Bridge Facility, and effective May 31, 2016, we terminated the commitments of the lenders under the Bridge Credit Agreement. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $9.3 million during the second quarter of 2016 related to the early extinguishment of the Bridge Credit Agreement. This charge primarily consisted of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
    
  c. Issuance of 4   3   /   8   % Notes, 5   3   /   8   % Notes and CAD Notes due 2023 
    
  In May 2016, IMI completed a private offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4   3   /   8   % Notes and IM US Holdings completed a private offering of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5   3   /   8   % Notes. The 4   3   /   8   % Notes and 5   3   /   8   % Notes were issued at par. The aggregate net proceeds of   $738.8 million   from the 4   3   /   8   % Notes and 5   3   /   8   % Notes, after paying the initial purchasers' commissions, were used, together with cash on hand and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, for the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. 
  On September 15, 2016, Canada Company completed a private offering of 250.0 million Canadian dollars in aggregate principal amount of the CAD Notes due 2023. The CAD Notes due 2023 were issued at par. The aggregate net proceeds from the CAD Notes due 2023 of 246.3 million Canadian dollars (or   $186.7 million   based upon the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the United States dollar on September 15, 2016 (the settlement date for the CAD Notes due 2023)), after paying the initial purchasers  commissions, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  d. Australian Dollar Term Loan 
    
   On September 28, 2016, Iron Mountain Australia Group Pty, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of IMI, entered into a 250.0 million Australian dollar Syndicated Term Loan B Facility (the  AUD Term Loan ) which matures in September 2022. The AUD Term Loan was issued at 99% of par. The net proceeds of approximately   243.8 million   Australian dollars (or approximately   $185.8 million   based upon the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar on September 28, 2016 (the settlement date for the AUD Term Loan)), after paying commissions to the joint lead arrangers and net of the original issue discount, were used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility in October 2016 and for general corporate purposes.  
    
  Principal payments on the AUD Term Loan are to be paid in quarterly installments in an amount equivalent to 6.3 million Australian dollars per year, with the remaining balance due on September 28, 2022. The AUD Term Loan is secured by substantially all assets of Iron Mountain Australia Group Pty. Ltd. IMI and the Guarantors guarantee all obligations under the AUD Term Loan. The interest rate on borrowings under the AUD Term Loan is based upon BBSY (an Australian benchmark variable interest rate) plus 4.3%. As of September 30, 2016, we had   250.0 million   Australian dollars outstanding on the AUD Term Loan and the interest rate in effect under the AUD Term Loan was   6.1%  .

e. Cash Pooling 
    
  Subsequent to the closing of the Recall Transaction, certain of our international subsidiaries began participating in a cash pooling arrangement (the  Cash Pool ) with Bank Mendes Gans ( BMG ) in order to help manage global liquidity requirements. The Cash Pool allows participating subsidiaries to borrow funds from BMG against amounts held on deposit with BMG by other participating subsidiaries. The Cash Pool has a legal right of offset and, therefore, amounts are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis. Each subsidiary receives interest on the cash balances held on deposit or pays interest on the amounts owed based on an applicable rate as defined in the Cash Pool agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , we had a net cash position of approximately   $18.9 million   (consisting of a gross cash position of approximately   $50.7 million   less outstanding borrowings of approximately   $31.8 million   by participating subsidiaries), which is reflected as cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.   
    
  f. Mortgage Securitization Program 
    
  In October 2016, we entered into a $50.0 million mortgage securitization program (the "Mortgage Securitization Program") involving certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries with Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company ( Goldman Sachs ). Under the Mortgage Securitization Program, IMIM contributed certain real estate assets to its wholly owned special purpose entity, Iron Mountain Mortgage Finance I, LLC (the "Mortgage Special Purpose Subsidiary"). The Mortgage Special Purpose Subsidiary then used the real estate to secure collateralized loans from Goldman Sachs. The Mortgage Special Purpose Subsidiary is a consolidated subsidiary of IMI. Borrowings under the Mortgage Securitization Program bear interest at 3.5%. The Mortgage Securitization Program is scheduled to terminate in November 2026. Proceeds from the Mortgage Securitization Program will be used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.

  For more information on our Credit Agreement and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program, see Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report.   
    
  Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures. 
  Acquisitions 
  On May 2, 2016 (Sydney, Australia time), we completed the Recall Transaction. At the closing of the Recall Transaction, we paid approximately   $331.8 million   and issued approximately   50.2 million   shares of our common stock which, based upon the closing price of our common stock as of April 29, 2016 (the last day of trading on the NYSE prior to the closing of the Recall Transaction) of $36.53 per share, resulted in a total purchase price to Recall shareholders of approximately   $2,166.9 million  .  
    
  We currently estimate total operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction to be approximately $380.0 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred by the end of 2018. This amount consists of (i) approximately $80.0 million of Recall Deal Close   Divestment Costs, (ii) approximately $220.0 million of Recall Integration Costs and (iii) approximately $80.0 million of capital expenditures to integrate Recall with our existing operations.

The following table presents the operating and capital expenditures associated with the Recall Transaction incurred for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the cumulative amount incurred through   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):  

In March 2016, we acquired a controlling interest in Docufile Holdings Proprietary Limited ("Docufile"), a storage and records management company with operations in South Africa, for approximately   $15.0 million  . The acquisition of Docufile represents our entrance into Africa. 
    
  In March 2016, in order to expand our presence in the Baltic region, we acquired the stock of Archyvu Sistemos, a storage and records management company with operations in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, for approximately   $5.1 million  . 
    
  In August 2016, we reached an agreement in principle under a non-binding memorandum of understanding to acquire the information management operations of Santa Fe Group A/S ( Santa Fe ) in ten regions within Europe and Asia for approximately 27.0 million Euro, or approximately $30.3 million (the  Santa Fe Transaction ), based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Euro as of September 30, 2016. Santa Fe operates its information management business in Spain, India, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan. The memorandum of understanding between us and Santa Fe is non-binding and any binding agreement we enter into with Santa Fe will be subject to closing conditions; accordingly, we can provide no assurance that we will complete this acquisition, that the acquisition will not be delayed or that the terms of the acquisition will not change. 
    
  Divestments  
    
  As discussed in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report, we are required to make the Divestments. The Access Sale (as defined in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report) resulted in total consideration of $80.0 million (including cash proceeds of $55.0 million received at the closing of the transaction and an additional amount of contingent consideration of up to $25.0 million payable upon the 27-month anniversary of the closing of the Access Sale). See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for information regarding our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration as a result of the Access Sale. The Australia Sale (as defined in Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report) resulted in total consideration of approximately 70.0 million Australian dollars (or approximately   $53.2 million  , based upon the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Australian dollar as of October 31, 2016), subject to adjustments. Our estimate (which incorporates current market conditions) of the proceeds we will receive in relation to the Seattle/Atlanta Divestments, the Canadian Divestments and the UK Divestments (each as defined in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report) is approximately $50.0 million. Upon the successful completion of these divestments, we anticipate using the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and ultimately to reinvest those proceeds in our business. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include senior or senior subordinated notes, secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings, and the issuance of equity. We expect to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described above. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. As a REIT, we expect our long-term capital allocation strategy will naturally shift toward lower leverage, though our leverage has increased over the last several fiscal years to fund the costs of the REIT conversion and the Recall Transaction.

Net Operating Losses  
  We have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire from 2021 through 2033, of $64.2 million at   September 30, 2016   to reduce future federal taxable income, of which $0.8 million of federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. We can carry forward these net operating losses to the extent we do not utilize them in any given available year. We have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire from 2016 through 2034, of which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $99.1 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 77%. 
  Inflation 
  Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies, the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases and customer contracts which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage rental or service charges. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, accumulated, summarized, communicated and reported to management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding what is required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act. As of   September 30, 2016   (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
  On May 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Recall. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report for further details about the Recall Transaction. As a result of the Recall Transaction, we are currently in the process of assessing and integrating Recall s internal controls over financial reporting into our financial reporting controls. 
  There have been no changes, other than associated with Recall discussed above, in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Act of 1934) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  Part II. Other Information 
   
  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  We did not sell any unregistered equity securities during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , nor did we repurchase any shares of our common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .
