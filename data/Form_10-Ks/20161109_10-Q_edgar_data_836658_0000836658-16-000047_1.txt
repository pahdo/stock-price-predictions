  NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q  , including "  Risk Factors  " and "  Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition  " contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future developments in our business or expectations for our future financial performance and any statement not involving a historical fact. Forward-looking statements use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. Actual results, performance or events may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement due to, among other things, (i) general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions in our core markets, (ii) performance of financial markets, including emerging markets, (iii) the frequency and severity of insured loss events, (iv) mortality and morbidity levels, (v) persistency and lapse levels, (vi) interest rates, (vii) currency exchange rates, (viii) general competitive factors, (ix) changes in laws and regulations, including those relating to insurance regulatory reform initiatives applicable to captive reinsurance entities and those made pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or the U.S. Department of Labor's final rules and exemptions pertaining to the fiduciary status of providers of investment advice; and (x) changes in the policies of governments and/or regulatory authorities. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from those in any forward-looking statement also include those described under "  Risk Factors  " and "  Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition  " in the   Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (File No. 001-32625) (the "  Annual Report on Form 10-K  ") and "Risk Factors," in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (File No. 001-32625). 
    
  The risks included here are not exhaustive. Current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.

  (Dollar amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) 

1.        Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies    
    
  Business 
    
  Voya Insurance and Annuity Company ("VIAC" or "the Company"), is a stock life insurance company domiciled in the State of Iowa and provides financial products and services in the United States. VIAC is authorized to conduct its insurance business in all states, except New York, and in the District of Columbia. 
    
  Prior to May 2013, Voya Financial, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, including the Company, was an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ING Groep N.V. ("ING Group" or "ING"), a global financial services holding company based in The Netherlands.  In May 2013, Voya Financial, Inc., completed its initial public offering of common stock, including the issuance and sale of common stock by Voya Financial, Inc. and the sale of shares of common stock owned indirectly by ING Group. Between October 2013 and March 2015, ING Group completed the sale of its remaining shares of common stock of Voya Financial, Inc. in a series of registered public offerings. ING Group continues to hold certain warrants to purchase up to   26,050,846   shares of Voya Financial, Inc. common stock at an exercise price of   $48.75  , in each case subject to adjustments. 
  VIAC is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Voya Holdings Inc. ("Parent"), which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Voya Financial, Inc.  
    
  The Company offers various insurance products, including fixed and indexed annuities, investment-only products and payout annuities for pre-retirement wealth accumulation and postretirement income management. The Company's annuity products are distributed by national and regional brokerage and securities firms, independent broker-dealers, banks, life insurance companies with captive agency sales forces, independent insurance agents, independent marketing organizations and affiliated broker-dealers.  The Company's primary annuity customers are individual consumers. The Company stopped actively writing new retail variable annuity products with substantial guarantee features in early 2010, as part of a global business strategy and risk reduction plan. New amounts will continue to be deposited in VIAC variable annuities as add-on premiums to existing contracts.   
    
  The Company has historically issued guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements (collectively referred to as "GICs"), primarily to institutional investors and corporate benefit plans. In 2009, the Company made a strategic decision to run-off the assets and liabilities in the GIC business over time. New GIC contracts may be issued on a limited basis to replace maturing contracts.  
    
  The Company has   one   operating segment. 
    
  Basis of Presentation  
    
  The accompanying Condensed Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and are unaudited. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Condensed Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  The accompanying Condensed Financial Statements reflect adjustments (including normal, recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  , and its results of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and its changes in shareholder's equity and statements of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year performance. The   December 31, 2015   Balance Sheet is from the audited Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC. Therefore, these unaudited Condensed Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Financial Statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Adoption of New Pronouncements 
    
  Derivative Contract Novations 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-05,  Derivatives and Hedging (Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  ( ASU 2016-05 ), which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship.  
    
  The provisions of ASU 2016-05 are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted, using either a prospective or modified retrospective approach. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-05 as of January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The adoption had no effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Consolidation 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ), which: 

Modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") or Voting Interest Entities ("VOEs"), including the requirement to consider the rights of all equity holders at risk to determine if they have the power to direct the entity's most significant activities. 
                
    Eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. Limited partnerships and similar entities will be VIEs unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights in the participating rights. 
                
    Affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. 
                
    Provides a new scope exception for registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds, and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the VIE guidance.  
       
  The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption had no effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations, but impacted disclosures only. Investments in limited partnerships previously accounted for as VOEs became VIEs under the new guidance as the limited partners do not hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights. See   Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") section   of the   Investments     Note to these Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. 
    
  Hybrid Financial Instruments 
  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16,  Derivatives and Hedging (ASC Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity  ( ASU 2014-16 ), which requires an entity to determine the nature of the host contract by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument, including all embedded derivative features. 
    
  The provisions of ASU 2014-16 were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016. The adoption had no effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Future Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (ASC Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. 
    
  The provisions of ASU 2016-15 are effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2016-15. 
    
  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ), which: 

Introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, 
                
    Modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities, and 
                
    Provides a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. 
       
  The provisions of ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  Initial adoption of ASU 2016-13 is required to be reported on a modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption, except for certain provisions that are required to be applied prospectively.  The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2016-13. 
    
  Debt Instruments 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (ASC Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  ( ASU 2016-06 ), which clarifies that an entity is only required to follow the four-step decision sequence when assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts for purposes of bifurcating an embedded derivative. The entity does not need to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. 
    
  The provisions of ASU 2016-06 are effective on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2016-06. 
    
  Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (ASC Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ), which requires: 

Equity investments (except those consolidated or accounted for under the equity method) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  
                
    Elimination of the disclosure of methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. 
                
    The use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 
                
    Separate presentation in other comprehensive income of the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in own credit risk if the liability is measured at fair value under the fair value option. 
                
    Separate presentation on the balance sheet or financial statement notes of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset. 
       
  The provisions of ASU 2016-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption only permitted for certain provisions. Initial adoption of ASU 2016-01 is required to be reported on a modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption,

except for certain provisions that are required to be applied prospectively. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2016-01. 
    
  Short-Duration Contracts 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, "Financial Services - Insurance (ASC Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts" ("ASU 2015-09"), which requires insurance entities to disclose, for annual reporting periods, information about the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and about significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses. The standard also requires entities to disclose, for annual and interim reporting periods, a rollforward of the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. 
    
  The provisions of ASU 2015-09 are effective, retrospectively, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2015-09. 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09"), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation under the contract. The standard also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 
    
  During 2016, the FASB issued the following amendments to clarify the provisions and implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09: 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to amend the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date, which is January 1, 2017. Initial adoption of ASU 2014-09 is required to be reported using either a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact of adoption of the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and its amendments.

The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities, including securities pledged, as of   September 30, 2016  , are shown below by contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as securities may be restructured, called or prepaid. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") and Other asset-backed securities ("ABS") are shown separately because they are not due at a single maturity date. 

The investment portfolio is monitored to maintain a diversified portfolio on an ongoing basis. Credit risk is mitigated by monitoring concentrations by issuer, sector and geographic stratification and limiting exposure to any one issuer. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did   no  t have any investments in a single issuer, other than obligations of the U.S. Government and government agencies, with a carrying value in excess of 10% of the Company s condensed Shareholder s equity.  
    
  The following tables set forth the composition of the U.S. and foreign corporate securities within the fixed maturity portfolio by industry category as of the dates indicated:

Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities    
    
  The Company's fixed maturities and equity securities are currently designated as available-for-sale, except those accounted for using the FVO. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized capital gains (losses) on these securities are recorded directly in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and presented net of related changes in Deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), Value of business acquired ("VOBA") and Deferred income taxes. In addition, certain fixed maturities have embedded derivatives, which are reported with the host contract on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
    
  The Company has elected the FVO for certain of its fixed maturities to better match the measurement of assets and liabilities in the Condensed Statements of Operations. Certain collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), primarily interest-only and principal-only strips, are accounted for as hybrid instruments and valued at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in Other net realized capital gains (losses) in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  The Company invests in various categories of CMOs, including CMOs that are not agency-backed, that are subject to different degrees of risk from changes in interest rates and defaults. The principal risks inherent in holding CMOs are prepayment and extension risks related to significant decreases and increases in interest rates resulting in the prepayment of principal from the underlying mortgages, either earlier or later than originally anticipated. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   46.2%   and   46.6%  , respectively, of the Company s CMO holdings, were invested in the above mentioned types of CMOs such as interest-only or principal-only strips, that are subject to more prepayment and extension risk than traditional CMOs. 
    
  Public corporate fixed maturity securities are distinguished from private corporate fixed maturity securities based upon the manner in which they are transacted. Public corporate fixed maturity securities are issued initially through market intermediaries on a registered basis or pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and are traded on the secondary market through brokers acting as principal. Private corporate fixed maturity securities are originally issued by borrowers directly to investors pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and are traded in the secondary market directly with counterparties, either without the participation of a broker or in agency transactions. 
    
  Securities Lending 
    
  The Company engages in securities lending whereby certain securities from its portfolio are loaned to other institutions through a lending agent for short periods of time. The Company has the right to approve any institution with whom the lending agent transacts on its behalf. Initial collateral is required at a rate of   102%   of the market value of the loaned securities. The lending agent retains the collateral and invests it in high quality liquid assets on behalf of the Company. The market value of the loaned securities is monitored on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the market value of the loaned securities fluctuates. The lending agent indemnifies the Company against losses resulting from the failure of a counterparty to return securities pledged where collateral is insufficient to cover the loss. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of loaned securities was   $288.5   and   $147.9  , respectively, and is included in Securities pledged on the Condensed Balance Sheets.   
    
  If cash is received as collateral, the lending agent retains the cash collateral and invests it in short-term liquid assets on behalf of the Company. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cash collateral retained by the lending agent and invested in short-term liquid assets on the Company's behalf was   $142.5   and   $153.6  , respectively, and is recorded in Short-term investments under securities loan agreements, including collateral delivered on the Condensed Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , liabilities to return collateral of   $142.5   and   $153.6  , respectively, are included in Payables under securities loan agreements, including collateral held on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016 under an amendment to the securities lending program, the Company began accepting non-cash collateral in the form of securities. The securities retained as collateral by the lending agent may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default, and are not reflected in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This collateral generally consists of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency securities and MBS pools. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of securities retained as collateral by the lending agent on the Company s behalf was   $156.9  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company did   no  t retain any securities as collateral.

The following table sets forth borrowings under securities lending transactions by class of collateral pledged for the dates indicated: 

(1)    Borrowings under securities lending transactions include both cash and non-cash collateral of   $142.5   and   $156.9  , respectively. 
    
  The Company's securities lending activities are conducted on an overnight basis, and all securities loaned can be recalled at any time. The Company does not offset assets and liabilities associated with its securities lending program. 
    
  Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") 
    
  The Company holds certain VIEs for investment purposes. VIEs may be in the form of private placement securities, structured securities, securitization transactions or limited partnerships. The Company has reviewed each of its holdings and determined that consolidation of these investments in the Company s financial statements is not required, as the Company is not the primary beneficiary, because the Company does not have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation or right to potentially significant losses or benefits for any of its investments in VIEs.  The Company did not provide any non-contractual financial support and its carrying value represents the Company's exposure to loss. The carrying value of the investments in VIEs was   $215.3   and   $1.2   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively; these investments are included in Limited partnerships/corporations on the Condensed Balance Sheets. Income and losses recognized on these investments are reported in Net investment income in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  Securitizations 
    
  The Company invests in various tranches of securitization entities, including Residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), Commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and asset-backed securities ("ABS"). Through its investments, the Company is not obligated to provide any financial or other support to these entities. Each of the RMBS, CMBS and ABS entities are thinly capitalized by design and considered VIEs. The Company's involvement with these entities is limited to that of a passive investor.  The Company has no unilateral right to appoint or remove the servicer, special servicer or investment manager, which are generally viewed to have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the securitization entities' economic performance, in any of these entities, nor does the Company function in any of these roles. The Company, through its investments or other arrangements, does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary and will not consolidate any of the RMBS, CMBS and ABS entities in which it holds investments. These investments are accounted for as investments available-for-sale as described in the   Fair Value Measurements   Note to these Condensed Financial Statements and unrealized capital gains (losses) on these securities are recorded directly in AOCI, except for certain RMBS, which are accounted for under the FVO, for which changes in fair value are reflected in Other net realized gains (losses) in the Condensed Statements of Operations. The Company's maximum exposure to loss on these structured investments is limited to the amount of its investment.

Investments with fair values less than amortized cost are included in the Company s other-than-temporary impairments analysis.  Impairments were recognized as disclosed in the "Evaluating Securities for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments" section below. The Company evaluates non-agency RMBS and ABS for "other-than-temporary impairments" each quarter based on actual and projected cash flows, after considering the quality and updated loan-to-value ratios reflecting current home prices of underlying collateral, forecasted loss severity, the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security and amount of any credit enhancements. The Company's assessment of current levels of cash flows compared to estimated cash flows at the time the securities were acquired (typically pre-2008) indicates the amount and the pace of projected cash flows from the underlying collateral has generally been lower and slower, respectively. However, since cash flows are typically projected at a trust level, the impairment review incorporates the security's position within the trust structure as well as credit enhancement remaining in the trust to determine whether an impairment is warranted. Therefore, while lower and slower cash flows will impact the trust, the effect on the valuation of a particular security within the trust will also be dependent upon the trust structure. Where the assessment continues to project

full recovery of principal and interest on schedule, the Company has not recorded an impairment. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that the remaining investments in an unrealized loss position were not other-than-temporarily impaired and therefore no further other-than-temporary impairment was necessary. 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructuring    
    
  The Company invests in high quality, well performing portfolios of commercial mortgage loans and private placements. Under certain circumstances, modifications are granted to these contracts. Each modification is evaluated as to whether a troubled debt restructuring has occurred. A modification is a troubled debt restructuring when the borrower is in financial difficulty and the creditor makes concessions. Generally, the types of concessions may include reducing the face amount or maturity amount of the debt as originally stated, reducing the contractual interest rate, extending the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market interest rates and/or reducing accrued interest. The Company considers the amount, timing and extent of the concession granted in determining any impairment or changes in the specific valuation allowance recorded in connection with the troubled debt restructuring. A valuation allowance may have been recorded prior to the quarter when the loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Accordingly, the carrying value (net of the specific valuation allowance) before and after modification through a troubled debt restructuring may not change significantly, or may increase if the expected recovery is higher than the pre-modification recovery assessment. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and the   year ended December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   new troubled debt restructurings for private placement bonds or commercial mortgage loans.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did   no  t have any commercial mortgage loans or private placements modified in a troubled debt restructuring with a subsequent payment default.  
    
  Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
    
  The Company's mortgage loans on real estate are all commercial mortgage loans held for investment, which are reported at amortized cost, less impairment write-downs and allowance for losses. The Company diversifies its commercial mortgage loan portfolio by geographic region and property type to reduce concentration risk. The Company manages risk when originating commercial mortgage loans by generally lending only up to   75%   of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate. Subsequently, the Company continuously evaluates mortgage loans based on relevant current information including a review of loan-specific credit quality, property characteristics and market trends. Loan performance is monitored on a loan specific basis through the review of submitted appraisals, operating statements, rent revenues and annual inspection reports, among other items. This review ensures properties are performing at a consistent and acceptable level to secure the debt. The components to evaluate debt service coverage are received and reviewed at least annually to determine the level of risk.    
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s investment in mortgage loans as of the dates indicated: 

N/A - Not Applicable

The carrying values and unpaid principal balances of impaired mortgage loans were as follows as of the dates indicated: 

The following table presents information on restructured loans as of the dates indicated:  

The Company defines delinquent mortgage loans consistent with industry practice as 60 days past due. The Company's policy is to recognize interest income until a loan becomes 90 days delinquent or foreclosure proceedings are commenced, at which point interest accrual is discontinued. Interest accrual is not resumed until the loan is brought current. 
    
  There were   no   mortgage loans in the Company's portfolio in process of foreclosure as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .    
    
  There were   no   loans 30 days or less in arrears, with respect to principal and interest as of   September 30, 2016  . There were   two   loans 30 days or less in arrears, with respect to principal and interest as of   December 31, 2015  , with a total amortized cost of   $2.1  .  
    
  Commercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when 90 days in arrears if the Company has concerns regarding the collectability of future payments, or if a loan has matured without being paid off or extended. Factors considered may include conversations with the borrower, loss of major tenant, bankruptcy of borrower or major tenant, decreased property cash flow, number of days past due, or various other circumstances. Based on an assessment as to the collectability of the principal, a determination is made to either apply against the book value or apply according to the contractual terms of the loan. Funds recovered in excess of book value would then be applied to recover expenses, impairments, and then interest. Accrual of interest resumes after factors resulting in doubts about collectability have improved.

Loan-to-value ("LTV") and debt service coverage ("DSC") ratios are measures commonly used to assess the risk and quality of mortgage loans. The LTV ratio, calculated at time of origination, is expressed as a percentage of the amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying property. A LTV ratio in excess of   100%   indicates the unpaid loan amount exceeds the underlying collateral. The DSC ratio, based upon the most recently received financial statements, is expressed as a percentage of the amount of a property s net income to its debt service payments. A DSC ratio of less than   1.0   indicates that a property s operations do not generate sufficient income to cover debt payments. These ratios are utilized as part of the review process described above.

Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) 
    
  Net realized capital gains (losses) comprise the difference between the amortized cost of investments and proceeds from sale and redemption, as well as losses incurred due to the credit-related and intent-related other-than-temporary impairment of investments.  Realized investment gains and losses are also primarily generated from changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within products and fixed maturities, changes in fair value of fixed maturities recorded at FVO and changes in fair value including accruals on derivative instruments, except for effective cash flow hedges. The cost of the investments on disposal is generally determined based on first-in-first-out ("FIFO") methodology.  
    
  Net realized capital gains (losses) were as follows for the periods indicated: 

Proceeds from the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities, available-for-sale and the related gross realized gains and losses, before tax, were as follows for the periods indicated: 

3.        Derivative Financial Instruments    
    
  The Company enters into the following types of derivatives: 
    
  Interest rate swaps and floors:   Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and/or liabilities. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the value of assets it owns or in an anticipation of acquiring them. Using interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest payments, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made to/from the counterparty at each due date. The Company uses interest rate floor contracts to hedge interest rate exposure if rates decrease below a specified level.  The Company utilizes these contracts in qualifying hedging relationships as well as non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Foreign exchange swaps:   The Company uses foreign exchange or currency swaps to reduce the risk of change in the value, yield or cash flows associated with certain foreign denominated invested assets. Foreign exchange swaps represent contracts that require  

Voya Insurance and Annuity Company 
  (A wholly owned subsidiary of Voya Holdings Inc.) 
  Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) 

the exchange of foreign currency cash flows against U.S. dollar cash flows at regular periods, typically quarterly or semi-annually. The Company utilizes these contracts in qualifying hedging relationships as well as non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Credit default swaps:   Credit default swaps are used to reduce credit loss exposure with respect to certain assets that the Company owns, or to assume credit exposure on certain assets that the Company does not own. Payments are made to or received from the counterparty at specified intervals. In the event of a default on the underlying credit exposure, the Company will either receive a payment (purchased credit protection) or will be required to make a payment (sold credit protection) equal to the par minus recovery value of the swap contract. The Company utilizes these contracts in non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Total return swaps:   The Company uses total return swaps as a hedge against a decrease in variable annuity account values, which are invested in certain indices. Using total return swaps, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of assets or a market index and the LIBOR rate, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. No cash is exchanged at the onset of the contracts. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based upon the terms of the swaps. The Company utilizes these contracts in non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Currency forwards:   The Company uses currency forward contracts to hedge policyholder liabilities associated with the variable annuity contracts which are linked to foreign indices. The currency fluctuations may result in a decrease in account values, which would increase the possibility of the Company incurring an expense for guaranteed benefits in excess of account values. The Company also utilizes currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposure related to invested assets. The Company utilizes these contracts in non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Futures:   Futures contracts are used to hedge against a decrease in certain equity indices. Such decreases may result in a decrease in variable annuity account values which would increase the possibility of the Company incurring an expense for guaranteed benefits in excess of account values. The Company also uses interest rate futures contracts to hedge its exposure to market risks due to changes in interest rates. The Company enters into exchange traded futures with regulated futures commissions that are members of the exchange. The Company also posts initial and variation margins, with the exchange, on a daily basis. The Company utilizes exchange-traded futures in non-qualifying hedging relationships. The Company also used futures contracts as a hedge against an increase in certain equity indices. Such increases may result in increased payments to the holders of fixed index annuity ("FIA") contracts. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company moved to a static hedging strategy for its FIA contracts and replaced futures contracts with equity options.   
    
  Swaptions:   A swaption is an option to enter into a swap with a forward starting effective date. The Company uses swaptions to hedge the interest rate exposure associated with the minimum crediting rate and book value guarantees embedded in the retirement products that the Company offers. Increases in interest rates will generate losses on assets that are backing such liabilities. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased swaptions by entering into offsetting written swaptions. The Company pays a premium when it purchases the swaption. The Company utilizes these contracts in non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Options:   The Company uses options to manage the equity, interest rate and equity volatility risk of the economic liabilities associated with certain variable annuity minimum guaranteed benefits and/or to mitigate certain rebalancing costs resulting from increased volatility. The Company also uses equity options to hedge against an increase in various equity indices, and interest rate options to hedge against an increase in the interest rate benchmarked crediting strategies within FIA contracts. Such increases may result in increased payments to the holders of the FIA contracts. The Company pays an upfront premium to purchase these options. The Company utilizes these options in non-qualifying hedging relationships. 
    
  Variance swaps:   The Company uses variance swaps to manage equity volatility risk on the economic liabilities associated with certain minimum guaranteed living benefits and/or to mitigate certain rebalancing costs resulting from increased volatility. An increase in the equity volatility results in higher valuations of such liabilities. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on the changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Embedded derivatives:   The Company also invests in certain fixed maturity instruments and has issued certain products that contain embedded derivatives whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in domestic and/or foreign interest rates (short-term or long-term), exchange rates, prepayment rates, equity rates, or credit ratings/spreads. In addition, the Company has entered into coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements, which contain embedded derivatives.  
    
  The Company's use of derivatives is limited mainly to economic hedging to reduce the Company's exposure to cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, credit risk, exchange rate risk and equity market risk.  It is the Company's policy not to offset amounts recognized for derivative instruments and amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. 
    
  The notional amounts and fair values of derivatives were as follows as of the dates indicated: 

(1)    Open derivative contracts are reported as Derivatives assets or liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheets at fair value. 
  N/A - Not Applicable 
    
  Based on the notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company s derivative positions was not designated or did not qualify for hedge accounting as part of a hedging relationship as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company utilizes derivative contracts mainly to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows, interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and equity market risk. The majority of derivatives used by the Company are designated as product hedges, which hedge the exposure arising from insurance liabilities or guarantees embedded in the contracts the Company offers through various product lines. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting as they do not meet the criteria of being "highly effective" as outlined in ASC Topic 815, but do provide an economic hedge, which is in line with the Company s risk management objectives. The Company also uses derivatives contracts to hedge its exposure to various risks associated with the investment portfolio. The Company does not seek hedge accounting treatment for certain of these derivatives as they generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules outlined in ASC Topic 815. The Company also uses credit default swaps coupled with other investments in order to produce the investment characteristics of otherwise permissible investments that do not qualify as effective accounting hedges under ASC Topic 815.

  Collateral 
    
  Under the terms of the OTC Derivative International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA") agreements, the Company may receive from, or deliver to, counterparties, collateral to assure that terms of the ISDA agreements will be met with regard to the Credit Support Annex ("CSA"). The terms of the CSA call for the Company to pay interest on any cash received equal to the Federal Funds rate. To the extent cash collateral is received and delivered, it is included in Payables under securities loan agreements, including collateral held and Short-term investments under securities loan agreements, including collateral delivered, respectively, on the Condensed Balance Sheets and is reinvested in short-term investments. Collateral held is used in accordance with the CSA to satisfy any obligations. Investment grade bonds owned by the Company are the source of noncash collateral posted, which is reported in Securities pledged on the Condensed Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   $1,319.6   of net cash collateral and pledged   $17.5   of net cash collateral related to OTC derivative contracts and cleared derivative contracts, respectively. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   $423.0   and   $0.4   of net cash collateral related to OTC derivative contracts and cleared derivative contracts, respectively. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company delivered   $459.0   of securities and held   $121.5   securities as collateral. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company delivered   $524.5   of securities and held   $12.9   of securities as collateral.

  Credit Default Swaps 
    
  The Company has entered into various credit default swaps. When credit default swaps are sold, the Company assumes credit exposure to certain assets that it does not own. Credit default swaps may also be purchased to reduce credit exposure in the Company s portfolio. Credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of credit default swaps of   $2.1   and   $11.0   were included in Derivatives assets and Derivatives liabilities, respectively, on the Condensed Balance Sheets. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of credit default swaps of   $2.3   and   $5.9   were included in Derivatives assets and Derivatives liabilities, respectively, on the Condensed Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum potential future net exposure to the Company was   $217.0   in credit default swaps. As of   December 31, 2015  , the maximum potential future net exposure to the Company was   $220.0   in credit default swaps. These instruments are typically written for a maturity period of   5   years and contain   no   recourse provisions. If the Company's current debt and claims paying ratings were downgraded in the future, the terms in the Company's derivative agreements may be triggered, which could negatively impact overall liquidity.

    Fair Value Measurements    
       
  Fair Value Measurement 
    
  The Company categorizes its financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, pursuant to ASU 2011-04, "Fair Value Measurements (ASC Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP" ("ASU 2011-04"). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  
    
  When available, the estimated fair value of financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques.

Valuation of Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value 
    
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at estimated fair value on the Company s Condensed Balance Sheets. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at initial recognition in many circumstances. However, in certain cases, the transaction price may not represent fair value. The fair value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a third-party with an equal credit standing. Fair value is required to be a market-based measurement that is determined based on a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date, from a market participant s perspective. The Company considers three broad valuation techniques when a quoted price is unavailable: (i) the market approach, (ii) the income approach and (iii) the cost approach. The Company determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use, given the instrument being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs. The Company prioritizes the inputs to fair valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available. 
    
  The Company utilizes a number of valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of exit price and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC Topic 820. Valuations are obtained from third-party commercial pricing services, brokers and industry-standard, vendor-provided software that models the value based on market observable inputs. The valuations obtained from third-party commercial pricing services are non-binding. The Company reviews the assumptions and inputs used by third-party commercial pricing services for each reporting period in order to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level. The documentation and analysis obtained from third-party commercial pricing services are reviewed by the Company, including in-depth validation procedures confirming the observability of inputs.  The valuations are reviewed and validated monthly through the internal valuation committee price variance review, comparisons to internal pricing models, back testing to recent trades or monitoring of trading volumes. 
    
  Fixed maturities:   The fair values for actively traded marketable bonds are determined based upon the quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1 assets. Assets in this category primarily include certain U.S. Treasury securities. 
    
  For fixed maturities classified as Level 2 assets, fair values are determined using a matrix-based market approach, based on prices obtained from third-party commercial pricing services and the Company s matrix and analytics-based pricing models, which in each case incorporate a variety of market observable information as valuation inputs. The market observable inputs used for these fair value measurements, by fixed maturity asset class, are as follows: 
    
  U.S. Treasuries:   Fair value is determined using third-party commercial pricing services, with the primary inputs being stripped interest and principal U.S. Treasury yield curves that represent a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon curve. 
    
  U.S. government agencies and authorities, State, municipalities and political subdivisions:   Fair value is determined using third-party commercial pricing services, with the primary inputs being U.S. Treasury yield curves, trades of comparable securities, credit spreads off benchmark yields and issuer ratings. 
    
  U.S. corporate public securities, Foreign corporate public securities and foreign governments:   Fair value is determined using third-party commercial pricing services, with the primary inputs being benchmark yields, trades of comparable securities, issuer ratings, bids and credit spreads off benchmark yields. 
    
  U.S. corporate private securities and Foreign corporate private securities:   Fair values are determined using a matrix and analytics-based pricing model. The model incorporates the current level of risk-free interest rates, current corporate credit spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. The model also considers a liquidity spread, the value of any collateral, the capital structure of the issuer, the presence of guarantees, and prices and quotes for comparably rated publicly traded securities. 
    
  RMBS, CMBS and ABS:   Fair value is determined using third-party commercial pricing services, with the primary inputs being credit spreads off benchmark yields, prepayment speed assumptions, current and forecasted loss severity, debt service coverage ratios, collateral type, payment priority within tranche and the vintage of the loans underlying the security.

Transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 
    
  There were   no   securities transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the beginning of the reporting period. 
    
  Level 3 Financial Instruments 
    
  The fair values of certain assets and liabilities are determined using prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (i.e., Level 3 as defined by ASC Topic 820), including but not limited to liquidity spreads for investments within markets deemed not currently active. These valuations, whether derived internally or obtained from a third-party, use critical assumptions that are not widely available to estimate market participant expectations in valuing the asset or liability. In addition, the Company has determined, for certain financial instruments, an active market is such a significant input to determine fair value that the presence of an inactive market may lead to classification in Level 3. In light of the methodologies employed to obtain the fair values of financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3, additional information is presented below.

For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the transfers in and out of Level 3 for fixed maturities were due to the variation in inputs relied upon for valuation each quarter. Securities that are primarily valued using independent broker quotes when prices are not available from one of the commercial pricing services are reflected as transfers into Level 3. When securities are valued using more widely available information, the securities are transferred out of Level 3 and into Level 1 or 2, as appropriate.  
    
  Significant Unobservable Inputs  
    
  The Company's Level 3 fair value measurements of its fixed maturities, equity securities available-for-sale and equity and credit derivative contracts are primarily based on broker quotes for which the quantitative detail of the unobservable inputs is neither provided nor reasonably corroborated, thus negating the ability to perform a sensitivity analysis. The Company performs a review of broker quotes by performing a monthly price variance comparison and back tests broker quotes to recent trade prices. 
    
  Quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the Company's Level 3 fair value measurements of its guaranteed benefit derivatives is presented in the following sections and table. 
    
  Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of GMABs, GMWBs and GMWBLs include long-term equity and interest rate implied volatility, correlations between the rate of return on policyholder funds and between interest rates and equity returns, nonperformance risk, mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions, such as benefit utilization, lapses and partial withdrawals. Such inputs are monitored quarterly.   
    
  Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of FIAs include nonperformance risk and policyholder behavior assumptions, such as lapses and partial withdrawals. Such inputs are monitored quarterly.  
    
  Following is a description of selected inputs: 
    
  Equity / Interest Rate Volatility:   A term-structure model is used to approximate implied volatility for the equity indices and swap rates for GMAB, GMWB and GMWBL fair value measurements. Where no implied volatility is readily available in the market, an alternative approach is applied based on historical volatility.  
    
  Correlations:   Integrated interest rate and equity scenarios are used in GMAB, GMWB and GMWBL fair value measurements to better reflect market interest rates and interest rate volatility correlations between equity and fixed income fund groups and between equity fund groups and interest rates. The correlations are based on historical fund returns and swap rates from external sources.   
    
  Nonperformance Risk:   For the estimate of the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the Company's product guarantees, the Company uses a blend of observable, similarly rated peer company credit default swap spreads, adjusted to reflect the credit quality of the Company as well as adjustment to reflect the priority of policyholder claims. 
    
  Actuarial Assumptions:   Management regularly reviews actuarial assumptions, which are based on the Company's experience and periodically reviewed against industry standards. Industry standards and Company experience may be limited on certain products.

(1)   
    Represents the range of reasonable assumptions that management has used in its fair value calculations. 
      (2)    Those policyholders who have elected systematic withdrawals are assumed to continue taking withdrawals. As a percent of policies,   40%   are taking systematic withdrawals. The Company assumes that   85%   of all policies will begin systematic withdrawals either immediately or after a delay period, with 100% utilizing at age 100. The utilization function varies by policyholder age and policy duration. Interactions with lapse and mortality also affect utilization. The utilization rate for GMWB and GMWBL tends to be lower for younger contract owners and contracts that have not reached their maximum accumulated GMWB and GMWBL benefit amount. There is also a lower utilization rate, though indirectly, for contracts that are less "in the money" (i.e., where the notional benefit amount is in excess of the account value) due to higher lapses. Conversely, the utilization rate tends to be higher for contract owners near or beyond retirement age and contracts that have accumulated their maximum GMWB or GMWBL benefit amount. There is also a higher utilization rate, though indirectly, for contracts which are highly "in the money." The chart below provides the GMWBL account value by current age group and average expected delay times from the associated attained age group as of   September 30, 2016   (account value amounts are in $ billions).

   (4)    The Company makes dynamic adjustments to lower the lapse rates for contracts that are more "in the money." The table below shows an analysis of policy account values according to whether they are in or out of the surrender charge period or at the shock lapse period and to whether they are "in the money" or "out of the money" as of   September 30, 2016   (account value amounts are in $ billions). Lapse ranges are based on weighted average ranges of underlying  account value exposure.

   (5)           The mortality rate is based on the 2012 Individual Annuity Mortality Basic table with mortality improvements. 
    
  Generally, the following will cause an increase (decrease) in the GMAB, GMWB and GMWBL embedded derivative fair value liabilities: 

An increase (decrease) in long-term equity implied volatility  
                
    An increase (decrease) in interest rate implied volatility 
                
    An increase (decrease) in equity-interest rate correlations  
                
    A decrease (increase) in nonperformance risk

    An increase (decrease) in benefit utilization 
                
    A decrease (increase) in lapses 
       
  Changes in fund correlations may increase or decrease the fair value depending on the direction of the movement and the mix of funds. Changes in partial withdrawals may increase or decrease the fair value depending on the timing and magnitude of withdrawals.

Generally, the following will cause an increase (decrease) in the FIA embedded derivative fair value liability: 

A decrease (increase) in nonperformance risk  
                
    A decrease (increase) in lapses 
       
  The Company notes the following interrelationships: 

Higher long-term equity implied volatility is often correlated with lower equity returns, which will result in higher in-the-moneyness, which in turn, results in lower lapses due to the dynamic lapse component reducing the lapses. This increases the projected number of policies that are available to use the GMWBL benefit and may also increase the fair value of the GMWBL. 
                
    Generally, an increase (decrease) in benefit utilization will decrease (increase) lapses for GMWB and GMWBL.

(1)     Certain amounts included in Deferred annuities are also reflected within the Guaranteed benefit derivatives section of the table above. 
    
  The following disclosures are made in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 825, which requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized at fair value on the Condensed Balance Sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. 
    
  ASC Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments, including insurance contracts and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.

  (Dollar amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) 

The following valuation methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of the following financial instruments, which are not carried at fair value on the Condensed Balance Sheets: 
    
  Mortgage loans on real estate:   The fair values for mortgage loans on real estate are estimated on a monthly basis using discounted cash flow analyses and rates currently being offered in the marketplace for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.  Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations. Mortgage loans on real estate are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Policy loans:   The fair value of policy loans approximates the carrying value of the loans. Policy loans are collateralized by the cash surrender value of the associated insurance contracts and are classified as Level 2.  
    
  Other investments:   Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock is carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value and is classified as Level 2.   
    
  Deposits from affiliates:   Fair value is estimated based on the fair value of the liabilities for the underlying contracts. Fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows, including associated expenses for maintaining the contracts, at rates, that are risk-free rates plus an adjustment for nonperformance risk. These liabilities are classified as Level 2. 
    
  Investment contract liabilities  : 
    
  Deferred annuities:   Fair value is estimated as the mean present value of stochastically modeled cash flows associated with the contract liabilities, taking into account assumptions about contract holder behavior. The stochastic valuation scenario set is consistent with current market parameters and discount is taken using stochastically evolving risk-free rates in the scenarios plus an adjustment for nonperformance risk. Margins for non-financial risks associated with the contract liabilities are also included. These liabilities are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Funding agreements with fixed maturities and guaranteed investment contracts:   Fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows, including associated expenses for maintaining the contracts, at rates, that are risk-free rates plus an adjustment for nonperformance risk. These liabilities are classified as Level 2. 
    
  Supplementary contracts and immediate annuities:   Fair value is estimated as the mean present value of the single deterministically modeled cash flows associated with the contract liabilities discounted using stochastically evolving short risk-free rates in the scenarios plus an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The valuation is consistent with current market parameters. Margins for non-financial risks associated with the contract liabilities are also included. These liabilities are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Long-term debt:   Estimated fair value of the Company s notes to affiliates is based upon discounted future cash flows using a discount rate approximating the current market rate, incorporating nonperformance risk and is classified as Level 2. 
    
  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about various financial instruments, such as estimates of timing and amounts of future cash flows. Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized capital gains (losses). In many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can the disclosed value be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. In evaluating the Company s management of interest rate, price and liquidity risks, the fair values of all assets and liabilities should be taken into consideration, not only those presented above.

7.        Income Taxes    

The Company's effective tax rates for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were   111.3%   and   101.7%  , respectively. These effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate of   35%   due to an increase in the tax valuation allowance and the effect of the dividends received deduction ("DRD"). 
    
  The Company's effective tax rates for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   were   12.4%   and   138.0%  , respectively. These effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate of   35%   due to an increase in the tax valuation allowance and the effect of the DRD. 
    
  Tax Sharing Agreement 
    
  The results of the Company's operations are included in the consolidated tax return of Voya Financial, Inc. Generally, the Company's financial statements recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences that result from the Company's activities during the current and preceding periods pursuant to the provisions of Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740) as if the Company were a separate taxpayer rather than a member of Voya Financial, Inc.'s consolidated income tax return group with the exception of any net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards, which are recorded pursuant to the tax sharing agreement. If the Company instead were to follow a separate taxpayer approach without any exceptions, there would be no impact to income tax expense (benefit) for the periods indicated above. Also, any current tax benefit related to the Company's tax attributes realized by virtue of its inclusion in the consolidated tax return of Voya Financial, Inc. would have been recorded directly to equity rather than income. Under the tax sharing agreement, Voya Financial, Inc. will pay the Company for the tax benefits of ordinary and capital losses only in the event that the consolidated tax group actually uses the tax benefit of losses generated. 
    
  Tax Regulatory Matters 
    
  During April 2016, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed its examination of Voya Financial, Inc.'s consolidated return (including the Company) through tax year 2014. The 2014 audit settlement did not have a material impact on the Company. Voya Financial, Inc. (including the Company) is currently under audit by the IRS, and it is expected that the examination of tax year 2015 will be finalized within the next twelve months. Voya Financial, Inc. (including the Company) and the IRS have agreed to participate in the Compliance Assurance Process for the tax years 2015 and 2016. 

8.        Financing Agreements    
    
  Reciprocal Loan Agreement 
    
  The Company maintains a reciprocal loan agreement with Voya Financial, Inc., an affiliate, to facilitate the handling of unanticipated short-term cash requirements that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Under this agreement, which became effective in January 2004 and based upon its renewal on January 14, 2014, expires on January 14, 2024, either party can borrow from the other up to   3.0%   of the Company's statutory net admitted assets as of the preceding   December 31  . Effective January 2014, interest on any borrowing by either the Company or Voya Financial, Inc. is charged at a rate based on the prevailing market rate for similar third-party borrowings or securities.  
    
  Under this agreement, the Company incurred   minimal   interest expense for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company did   no  t earn interest income for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and earned   $0.8   in interest income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  The Company did   no  t earn interest income for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   and earned    $0.7   in interest income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did   no  t have an outstanding receivable/payable from/to Voya Financial, Inc. under the reciprocal loan agreement. 
    
  For information on the Company's additional financing agreements, see the   Related Party Transactions   Note in the Financial Statements in Part II,   Item 8.   in the Company's   Annual Report on Form 10-K  .

9.        Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Commitments 
    
  Through the normal course of investment operations, the Company commits to either purchase or sell securities, mortgage loans, or money market instruments, at a specified future date and at a specified price or yield. The inability of counterparties to honor these commitments may result in either a higher or lower replacement cost. Also, there is likely to be a change in the value of the securities underlying the commitments. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had off-balance sheet commitments to acquire mortgage loans of   $153.0   and   $323.6  , respectively, and purchase limited partnerships and private placement investments of   $456.9   and   $285.9  , respectively. 
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank Funding 
    
  The Company is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines and is required to maintain collateral to back funding agreements issued to the FHLB. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $649.2   and   $950.4  , respectively, in non-putable funding agreements, including accrued interest, issued to the FHLB. These non-putable funding agreements are included in Future policy benefits and contract owner account balances on the Condensed Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , assets with a market value of   $0.7 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively, collateralized the funding agreements to the FHLB. Assets pledged to the FHLB are included in Fixed maturities, available-for-sale, on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
    
  Restricted Assets 
    
  The Company is required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support its insurance operations.  The Company may also post collateral in connection with certain securities lending, repurchase agreements, funding agreements, letter of credit ("LOC") and derivative transactions as described further in this note. The components of the fair value of the restricted assets were as follows as of the dates indicated: 

(1)    Reported in Other investments on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
   (2)    Includes the fair value of loaned securities of   $288.5   and   $147.9   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company delivered securities as collateral of   $459.0   and   $524.5  , respectively. Loaned securities and securities delivered as collateral are included in Securities pledged on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
    
  Litigation, Regulatory Matters and Loss Contingencies  
    
  Litigation, regulatory and other loss contingencies arise in connection with the Company's activities as a diversified financial services firm. The Company is a defendant in a number of litigation matters arising from the conduct of its business, both in the ordinary course and otherwise. In some of these matters, claimants seek to recover very large or indeterminate amounts, including compensatory, punitive, treble and exemplary damages. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages and other relief. Claimants are not always required to specify the monetary damages they seek or they may be required only to state an amount sufficient to meet a court's jurisdictional requirements.  Moreover, some jurisdictions allow claimants to allege monetary damages that far exceed any reasonably possible verdict. The variability in pleading requirements and past experience demonstrates that the monetary and other relief that may be requested in a lawsuit or claim often bears little relevance to the merits or potential value of a claim. Litigation against the Company includes a variety of claims including negligence, breach of contract, fraud, violation of regulation or statute, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, failure to supervise, elder abuse and other torts.   

Voya Insurance and Annuity Company 
  (A wholly owned subsidiary of Voya Holdings Inc.) 
  Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) 

As with other financial services companies, the Company periodically receives informal and formal requests for information from various state and federal governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in connection with inquiries and investigations of the products and practices of the Company or the financial services industry. It is the practice of the Company to cooperate fully in these matters. Regulatory investigations, exams, inquiries and audits could result in regulatory action against the Company. The potential outcome of such action is difficult to predict but could subject the Company to adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, settlement payments, additional payments to beneficiaries and additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws. They may also result in fines and penalties and changes to the Company's procedures for the identification and escheatment of abandoned property or the correction of processing errors and other financial liability. 
    
  The outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is difficult to predict and the amount or range of potential losses associated with these or other loss contingencies, requires significant management judgment. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to provide reasonably possible losses or ranges of losses for all pending regulatory matters, litigation, and other loss contingencies.  While it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position, based on information currently known, management believes that neither the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory matters, nor potential liabilities associated with other loss contingencies, are likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and indeterminate amounts sought in certain litigation and the inherent unpredictability of all such matters, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the Company's litigation or regulatory matters, or liabilities arising from other loss contingencies, could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect upon the Company's results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. 
    
  For some matters, the Company is able to estimate a possible range of loss. For such matters in which a loss is probable, an accrual has been made. For matters where the Company, however, believes a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, no accrual is required. For matters for which an accrual has been made, but there remains a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued or for matters where no accrual is required, the Company develops an estimate of the unaccrued amounts of the reasonably possible range of losses. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of any amounts accrued for these matters as of such date, is not material to the Company. 
    
  For other matters, the Company is currently not able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from plaintiffs and other parties, investigation of factual allegations, rulings by a court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement discussions. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation and regulatory contingencies and updates the Company's accruals, disclosures and reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.

Item 2.        Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
  (Dollar amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated) 
    
  For the purposes of the discussion in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q  , the terms "Company," "we," "our," "us" and "VIAC" refer to Voya Insurance and Annuity Company.  We are a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Voya Holdings Inc. ("Parent"), which is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Voya Financial, Inc.  
    
  The following discussion and analysis presents a review of our results of operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and financial condition as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This item should be read in its entirety and in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and related notes contained in Part I.,   Item 1.   of this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q  , as well as "  Management's Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition  " section contained in our   Annual Report on Form 10-K   for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ("  Annual Report on Form 10-K  ").  
    
  In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  See "Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."  

Basis of Presentation 
    
  VIAC is a stock life insurance company domiciled in the State of Iowa and provides financial products and services in the United States. VIAC is authorized to conduct its insurance business in all states, except New York, and in the District of Columbia. 
    
  Products currently offered by us include fixed and indexed annuities, and payout annuities, designed to address customer needs for tax-advantaged savings, retirement needs and wealth-protection concerns. We also offer guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements (collectively referred to as "GICs"). We stopped actively writing new retail annuity products with substantial guarantee features in early 2010. 
    
  We have   one   operating segment. 

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  For information regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements, see the     Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   Note in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I,   Item 1.   of this Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q  . 
    
  Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates  
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on-going basis based on historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that is reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will conform to estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially affected by the need to make future accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time. 
    
  We have identified the following accounting judgments and estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:  

Reserves for future policy benefits;  
                
    Deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), value of business acquired ("VOBA") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"); 
                
    Valuation of investments and derivatives;  
                
    Impairments;  
                
    Income taxes; and  
                
    Contingencies. 

In developing these accounting estimates, we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material changes as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, we believe the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon preparation of the Condensed Financial Statements. 
    
  The above critical accounting estimates are described in the   Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   Note in our Financial Statements in Part II,   Item 8.   of our   Annual Report on Form 10-K  . 
    
  Assumptions and Periodic Review 
    
  Changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on DAC, VOBA, DSI,  amortization rates, reserve levels and results of operations. Assumptions are management's best estimates of future outcome. We periodically review these assumptions against actual experience and, based on additional information that becomes available, update our assumptions. 
  During the third quarter of   2016   and   2015  , we conducted our annual review of assumptions, including projection model inputs. As a result of these reviews, in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made a number of changes, which resulted in favorable/(unfavorable) impacts on Income (loss) before income taxes of   $102.7 million   and   $(34.3) million  , respectively, of which   $34.7 million   and   $(83.0) million   was related to DAC/VOBA and other intangibles unlocking.  
  We also review the recoverability of DAC, VOBA and DSI balances each period. These assets are deemed to be unrecoverable if the estimated gross profits do not exceed these balances and a write-down is recorded as loss recognition. During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized loss recognition of   $42.5 million   and   $170.0 million  , respectively, before income taxes, of which   $34.4 million   and   $137.7 million  , respectively, was recorded to Net amortization of DAC and VOBA, and   $8.1 million   and   $32.3 million  , respectively, was recorded to Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners, in the Condensed Statements of Operations, with a corresponding decrease on the Condensed Balance Sheets to Deferred policy acquisition costs, Value of business acquired, and Sales inducements to contract owners. During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized loss recognition of   $342.0 million   before income taxes, of which   $276.9 million   was recorded to Net amortization of DAC and VOBA, and   $65.1 million   was recorded to Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners.  
    
  During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we established premium deficiency reserves of $  25.6 million   and $  36.3 million  , respectively, before tax related to certain payout annuity contracts. During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we established a premium deficiency reserve of   $126.0 million  . The premium deficiency reserves established for the three and   nine months   ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were recorded as increases in Policyholder benefits and contract owner account balances with a corresponding increase in Deposits and reinsurance recoverable, as the reserves are ceded to an affiliate on a 100% coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld basis. As a result, the establishment of these premium deficiency reserves had no impact on the Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Income Taxes  
    
  Our effective tax rates for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were   111.3%   and   101.7%  , respectively. These effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate of   35%   due to an increase in the tax valuation allowance and the effect of the dividends received deduction ("DRD"). 
    
  Our effective tax rates for the     three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   were   12.4%   and   138.0%  , respectively. These effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate of   35%   due to an increase in the tax valuation allowance and the effect of the DRD. 
    
  GMIB Buyout Offer  
    
  The focus in managing our closed block of variable annuity products continues to be on protecting regulatory and rating agency capital, and our hedging program is primarily designed to mitigate the impacts of market movements on capital resources, rather than mitigating earnings volatility. Additionally, we continue to judiciously seek opportunities to accelerate the run-off of the block, such as through our recent offerings of enhanced income for eligible guaranteed minimum income benefit ("GMIB") policyholders which allowed for optional early annuitization. In October 2016, we filed a GMIB enhanced surrender value offer with the SEC which, if we decide to proceed with, would provide certain GMIB policyholders an option to surrender their contracts in exchange for an enhancement to their contract s surrender value. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Our Net loss for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   improved   $333.4 million   from a loss of   $338.3 million   to a loss of   $4.9 million   primarily due to decreases in Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders and Operating expenses, an increase in Net investment income and a favorable change in Other expense, partially offset by an unfavorable change in Total net realized capital gains (losses), an increase in Net amortization of DAC and VOBA, an unfavorable change in Income tax expense (benefit), and a decrease in Fee income. 
    
  Revenues    
    
  Total revenues     decreased     $843.0 million   from   $1,174.6 million   to   $331.6 million   primarily due to unfavorable changes in Total net realized capital gains (losses) and a decrease in Fee income, partially offset by an increase in Net investment income.  
    
  Net investment income     increased     $14.7 million   from   $322.1 million   to   $336.8 million   primarily due to growth in the general account assets, driven by positive net flows, higher alternative investment income and higher prepayment fee income, partially offset by the impact of the continued low interest rate environment on reinvestment rates.  
    
  Fee income   decreased     $14.3 million     from   $175.2 million   to   $160.9 million   primarily due to lower average separate account assets under management resulting from the continued runoff of our closed block of variable annuity business.  

Total net realized capital gains (losses)   changed    $839.6 million   from a gain of   $544.1 million   to a loss of   $295.5 million   primarily due to an unfavorable change in annuity hedging derivatives of $1,257.5 million, partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of embedded derivatives on product guarantees of   $408.7 million  . Under the variable annuity and fixed indexed annuity hedge programs, changes in equity and interest markets during the current period resulted in net unfavorable changes in equity, interest and foreign exchange derivatives from a net gain of $846.3 million  in the prior period to a net loss of $411.2 million in the current period. A portion of these derivative gains (losses) were ceded under the combined coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld agreement (from a gain of $932.7 million in the prior period to a loss of $423.8 million in the current period) and an offset was recorded to Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders. See the   Related Party Transactions     Footnote     in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the combined coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld agreement. The favorable changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives on product guarantees from a loss of   $263.5 million   in the prior period to a gain of   $145.2 million   in the current period were primarily due to favorable impacts from changes in interest rates, annual assumption impacts, implied volatility and equity market movements, partially offset by an unfavorable impact resulting from nonperformance risk. 
    
  Benefits and Expenses    
    
  Total benefits and expenses     decreased     $1,273.0 million   from   $1,560.6 million   to   $287.6 million   primarily due to lower Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders and Operating expenses and a favorable change in Other expense, partially offset by an increase in Net amortization of DAC and VOBA.  
    
  Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders   decreased   $1,371.4 million   from   $1,395.6 million   to   $24.2 million   primarily due to the change in the amount of equity and interest rate derivative gains/losses transferred under the combined coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld agreement (the corresponding offsetting amount is reported in Total net realized capital gains (losses)), lower unfavorable impact from annual assumptions updates, equity market movements and lower loss recognition on sales inducements. These decreases were partially offset by higher amortization of sales inducements on higher gross profits.  
    
  Operating expenses     decreased     $19.2 million   from   $127.4 million   to   $108.2 million   primarily due to lower commission expense on lower average separate account assets under management, lower operating expenses due to the continued runoff of our closed block of variable annuity business and lower consulting expenses, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. 
    
  Net amortization of DAC and VOBA   increased   $122.6 million   from   $27.4 million   to   $150.0 million   primarily due to higher amortization as a result of higher gross profits, partially offset by favorable DAC/VOBA unlocking due to the annual assumptions updates and lower loss recognition in the current period. See   Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates   for further detail on the loss recognition of DAC and VOBA. 
    
  Other expense   decreased     $5.1 million   from   $3.1 million   to a benefit of   $2.0 million   primarily due to lower amortization of deferred reinsurance losses and expenses incurred in the prior period related to the multi-year guaranteed fixed annuity contracts coinsurance agreement that did not reoccur due to the recapture of this agreement in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense (benefit)   changed   $96.6 million   from a benefit of   $47.7 million   to an expense of   $48.9 million   primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the tax valuation allowance.  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Our Net income (loss) for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $15.1 million   from income of   $13.8 million   to loss of   $1.3 million   primarily due to unfavorable changes in Total net realized capital gains (losses) and Income tax expense (benefit) and a decrease in Fee income, partially offset by a favorable change in Net amortization of DAC and VOBA, a decrease in Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders, an increase in Net investment income, and decreases in Operating expenses and Other expense. 
    
  Revenues    
    
  Total revenues     decreased     $751.7 million   from   $2,383.7 million   to   $1,632.0 million   primarily due to unfavorable changes in Total net realized capital gains (losses) and a decrease in Fee income, partially offset by an increase in Net investment income.  
    
  Net investment income     increased     $49.5 million   from   $960.6 million   to   $1,010.1 million   primarily due to growth in the general account assets, driven by positive net flows, and higher prepayment fee income, partially offset by lower alternative investment income and the impact of the continued low interest rate environment on reinvestment rates.  
    
  Fee income   decreased     $78.1 million     from   $550.3 million   to   $472.2 million   primarily due to lower average separate account assets under management resulting from the continued runoff of our closed block of variable annuity business.  
    
  Total net realized capital gains (losses)   changed   $719.3 million   from a gain of   $482.1 million   to a loss of   $237.2 million   primarily due to an unfavorable change in annuity hedging derivatives of $749.6 million, partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of embedded derivatives on product guarantees of   $13.4 million  . Under the variable annuity and fixed indexed annuity hedge programs, changes in equity and interest markets during the current period resulted in net unfavorable changes in equity, interest and foreign exchange derivatives from a net gain of $524.2 million in the prior period to a net loss of $225.4 million in the current period. A portion of these derivative gains (losses) were ceded under the combined coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld agreement (from a gain of $651.3 million in the prior period to a loss of $120.9 million in the current period) and an offset was recorded to Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders. The favorable change in the fair value of embedded derivatives on product guarantees from a gain of   $45.8 million   in the prior period to a gain of   $59.2 million   in the current period was primarily due to favorable impacts resulting from nonperformance risk, annual assumption updates and equity market movements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from interest rate movements.  
    
  Benefits and Expenses    
    
  Total benefits and expenses     decreased     $870.3 million   from   $2,420.0 million   to   $1,549.7 million   primarily due to a favorable change in Net amortization of DAC and VOBA and decreases in Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders, Operating expenses and Other expense.  
    
  Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders     decreased     $197.8 million   from   $1,617.4 million   to   $1,419.6 million   primarily due to the change in the amount of equity and interest rate derivative gains transferred under the combined coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld agreement (the corresponding offsetting amount is reported in Total  net realized capital gains (losses)) lower unfavorable impacts from annual assumptions updates, equity market movements and lower loss recognition on sales inducements. These decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable change in the embedded derivative on the coinsurance funds withheld arrangements resulting from interest rate movements and higher amortization of sales inducements. 
    
  Operating expenses     decreased     $20.4 million   from   $364.4 million   to   $344.0 million   primarily due to lower commission expense on lower average separate account assets under management and lower operating expenses due to the continued runoff of the closed block of variable annuity products. 
    
  Net amortization of DAC and VOBA   changed   $638.2 million   from an expense of   $398.8 million   to a benefit of   $239.4 million   primarily due to favorable amortization as a result of lower gross profits (negative gross profits in the current period compared to positive gross profits in the prior period), favorable DAC/VOBA unlocking due to the annual assumptions updates and lower loss recognition in the current period. See   Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates   for further detail on the loss recognition of DAC and VOBA. 
    
  Other expense   decreased     $14.0 million   from   $18.3 million   to   $4.3 million   primarily due to lower amortization of deferred reinsurance losses and expenses incurred in the prior period related to the multi-year guaranteed fixed annuity contracts coinsurance agreement that did not reoccur due to the recapture of this agreement in the third quarter of 2015. 

Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense (benefit)   changed     $133.7 million   from a benefit of   $50.1 million   to an expense of   $83.6 million   primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes and an increase in the tax valuation allowance.

Fixed maturities rated BB and below may have speculative characteristics and changes in economic conditions or other circumstances that are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the issuer to make principal and interest payments than is the case with higher rated fixed maturities. 

Unrealized Capital Losses 
    
  Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities, including securities pledged, decreased   $396.1 million   from   $470.8 million   to   $74.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in gross unrealized losses was primarily due to declining interest rates.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did   no  t have any fixed maturities with an unrealized capital loss in excess of $10.0 million. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $2.0 billion   and   $2.2 billion  , fair value of energy sector fixed maturity securities, constituting   7.9%   and   9.3%  , of total fixed maturities portfolio, with gross unrealized capital losses of   $21.9 million   and   $175.9 million  , respectively. See the   Investments   Note in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   for further information on unrealized capital losses. 
    
  Subprime and Alt-A Mortgage Exposure  
    
  Pre-2008 vintage subprime and Alt-A mortgage collateral continues to distance itself from the credit crisis and payment performance reflects a housing market firmly entrenched in recovery. While collateral losses continue to be realized, the pace and magnitude at which losses are being realized are steadily decreasing. Serious delinquencies and other measures of performance, like prepayments and loan defaults, have also displayed sustained periods of improvement. More broadly, home prices have moved steadily higher, further supporting bond payment performance. Year-over-year home price measures, while at a lower magnitude than experienced in the years following the trough in home prices, appear to have stabilized at sustainable levels, when measured on a nationwide basis. This backdrop remains supportive of continued improvement in overall borrower payment behavior. Reflecting these fundamental improvements, related bond prices and sector liquidity have increased substantially since the credit crisis. In managing our risk exposure to subprime and Alt-A mortgages, we take into account collateral performance and structural characteristics associated with our various positions. 
    
  We do not originate or purchase subprime or Alt-A whole-loan mortgages. Subprime lending is the origination of loans to customers with weaker credit profiles. We define Alt-A mortgages to include the following: residential mortgage loans to customers who have strong credit profiles but lack some element(s), such as documentation to substantiate income; residential mortgage loans to borrowers that would otherwise be classified as prime but whose loan structure provides repayment options to the borrower that increase the risk of default; and any securities backed by residential mortgage collateral not clearly identifiable as prime or subprime. 
    
  We have exposure to Residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), Commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and ABS. Our exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities is primarily in the form of ABS structures collateralized by subprime residential mortgages and the majority of these holdings were included in Other ABS under "Fixed Maturities" above. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value, amortized cost and gross unrealized losses related to our exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities totaled   $113.6 million  ,   $111.3 million   and   $5.4 million  , respectively, representing   0.5%   of total fixed maturities, including securities pledged, based on fair value. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value, amortized cost and gross unrealized losses related to our exposure to subprime mortgage-backed securities totaled   $118.9 million  ,   $116.3 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, representing   0.5%   of total fixed maturities, including securities pledged, based on fair value. 

Our exposure to Alt-A mortgages is included in the "RMBS" line item in the "Fixed Maturities" table under "Fixed Maturities" above. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value, amortized cost and gross unrealized losses related to our exposure to Alt-A RMBS totaled   $74.5 million  ,   $65.8 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, representing   0.3%   of total fixed maturities including securities pledged, based on fair value.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value, amortized cost and gross unrealized losses related to our exposure to Alt-A RMBS totaled   $87.0 million  ,   $76.0 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, representing   0.4%   of total fixed maturities, including securities pledged, based on fair value. 

Commercial Mortgage-backed and Other Asset-backed Securities 
    
  CMBS investments represent pools of commercial mortgages that are broadly diversified across property types and geographical areas. Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages increased over the course of 2009 through mid-2012. Since then, the steep pace of increases observed in the early years following the credit crisis has ceased, and the percentage of delinquent loans declined through February 2016 (although certain months did post marginal increases). Since then, the delinquency rate has increased slowly and remains lower on a year-over-year and year to date basis. Other performance metrics like vacancies, property values and rent levels have posted sustained improvement trends, although these metrics are not observed uniformly, differing by dimensions such as geographic location and property type. These improvements have been buoyed by some of the same macro- 

economic tailwinds alluded to in regards to our subprime and Alt-A mortgage exposure. A robust environment for property refinancing was particularly supportive of improving credit performance metrics throughout much of the post-credit crisis period. In the first quarter of 2016, however, this virtuous lending cycle was disrupted as the dislocation in corporate credit markets negatively impacted liquidity conditions in CMBS. As a result, the new issuance market for CMBS slowed considerably during the first half of this year.  This dynamic, should it resurface, is a risk for the overall performance health of the sectors and is being monitored closely for potential negative impacts. Spread performance in the first half of 2016 was volatile, although signs of increased liquidity and more general stability in credit spreads was observed over the course of the third quarter. 
    
  For non-student loan consumer ABS, delinquency and loss rates have been maintained at levels considered low by historical standards and indicative of high credit quality. Relative strength in various credit metrics across multiple types of asset-backed loans have been observed on a sustained basis. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value and amortized cost of our exposure to Other ABS, excluding subprime exposure, totaled   $172.8 million   and   $168.5 million  , respectively. There were   no   gross unrealized losses related to Other ABS. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value and amortized cost of our exposure to Other ABS, excluding subprime exposure, totaled   $147.0 million   and   $142.8 million  , respectively. There were   no   gross unrealized losses related to Other ABS.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Other ABS was broadly diversified both by type and issuer with credit card receivables and nonconsolidated collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") comprising   23.9%   and   36.5%  , respectively, of total Other ABS, excluding subprime exposure. There were   no   automobile receivables related to Other ABS. As of   December 31, 2015  , Other ABS was broadly diversified both by type and issuer with credit card receivables comprising   55.3%  , of total Other ABS, excluding subprime exposure.There were   no   automobile receivables and nonconsolidated collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") related to Other ABS. 

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
    
  We rate commercial mortgages to quantify the level of risk. We place those loans with higher risk on a watch list and closely monitor these loans for collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal and/or interest. If we determine the value of any mortgage loan to be other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") (i.e., when it is probable that we will be unable to collect on amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement), the carrying value of the mortgage loan is reduced to either the present value of expected cash flows from the loan, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or fair value of the collateral. For those mortgages that are determined to require foreclosure, the carrying value is reduced to the fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated costs to obtain and sell at the point of foreclosure. The carrying value of the impaired loans is reduced by establishing an other-than-temporary write-down recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses) in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  Loan-to-value ("LTV") and debt service coverage ("DSC") ratios are measures commonly used to assess the risk and quality of commercial mortgage loans. The LTV ratio, calculated at time of origination, is expressed as a percentage of the amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying property. An LTV ratio in excess of 100% indicates the unpaid loan amount exceeds the value of the underlying collateral. The DSC ratio, based upon the most recently received financial statements, is expressed as a percentage of the amount of a property's Net income (loss) to its debt service payments. A DSC ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that a property's operations do not generate sufficient income to cover debt payments. These ratios are utilized as part of the review process described above. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our mortgage loans on real estate portfolio had a weighted average DSC of   2.3   times and a weighted average LTV ratio of   61.1%  . As of   December 31, 2015  , our mortgage loans on real estate portfolio had a weighted average DSC of   2.2   times and a weighted average LTV ratio of   60.4%  . See the   Investments   Note in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item I. of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   for further information on mortgage loans on real estate. 

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
    
  We evaluate available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities for impairment on a regular basis. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value.  See the   Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies     Note in our Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the policy used to evaluate whether the investments are other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
  During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $1.8 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively, of credit related OTTI of which the primary contributor was   $1.4 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, of write-downs recorded in the  

Foreign Private and RMBS sector. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $1.7 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively, of intent related OTTI, which were primarily related to the intent to sell positions in energy sector public corporate credits either because of a commitment to sell or an expectation that we may be required to sell as a result of our investment guidelines. See the   Investments   Note in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   for further information on OTTI. 
    
  European Exposures 
    
  We closely monitor our exposures to European sovereign debt in general, with a primary focus on the sovereign debt of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (which we refer to as "peripheral Europe"), as these countries have applied for support from the European Financial Stability Facility or received support from the European Central Bank via government bond purchases in the secondary market.  
    
  The financial turmoil in Europe continues to be a potential threat to global capital markets and remains a challenge to global financial stability.  Additionally, the possibility of capital market volatility spreading through a highly integrated and interdependent banking system remains. Despite signs of continuous improvement in the region, it is our view that the risk among European sovereigns and financial institutions still warrants scrutiny, in addition to our customary surveillance and risk monitoring, given how highly correlated these sectors of the region have become.  
    
  The United States and European Union continue to maintain sanctions against select Russian businesses in response to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. We remain comfortable with our aggregate Russian exposure of   $42.2 million  , given its relatively small allocation in our total investment portfolio. 
    
  We quantify and allocate our exposure to the region, as described in the table below, by attempting to identify aspects of the region or country risk to which we are exposed. Among the factors we consider are the nationality of the issuer, the nationality of the issuer's ultimate parent, the corporate and economic relationship between the issuer and its parent, as well as the political, legal and economic environment in which each functions. By undertaking this assessment, we believe that we develop a more accurate assessment of the actual geographic risk, with a more integrated understanding of contributing factors to the full risk profile of the issuer. 
    
  In the normal course of our ongoing risk and portfolio management process, we closely monitor compliance with a credit limit hierarchy designed to minimize overly concentrated risk exposures by geography, sector and issuer. This framework takes into account various factors such as internal and external ratings, capital efficiency and liquidity and is overseen by a combination of Investment and Corporate Risk Management, as well as insurance portfolio managers focused specifically on managing the investment risk embedded in our portfolio. 
    
  The following table presents our European exposures, for selected countries based on risk, at fair value and amortized cost as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)    Includes   $0.4 million   derivative assets. 
    
  We did not have any exposure to Greece or Portugal. Among the remaining   $2.9 billion   of total non-peripheral European exposure, we had a portfolio of credit-related assets similarly diversified by country and sector across developed and developing Europe.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our sovereign exposure was   $83.4 million  , which consisted of fixed maturities. We also had   $413.9 million   in net exposure to non-peripheral financial institutions with a concentration in France of   $82.0 million  , The Netherlands of   $87.4 million  , Switzerland of   $115.5 million   and the United Kingdom of   $98.4 million  . The balance of   $2.4 billion   was invested across non-peripheral, non-financial institutions.  
    
  In addition to aggregate concentration in the United Kingdom of   $1,077.9 million  , we had significant non-peripheral European total country exposures in The Netherlands of   $401.7 million  , in France of   $312.5 million  , in Germany of   $285.9 million   and in  

Switzerland of   $293.1 million  . We place additional scrutiny on our financial exposure in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and The Netherlands given our concern for the potential for volatility to spread through the European banking system. We believe the primary risk results from market value fluctuations resulting from spread volatility and the secondary risk is default risk, dependent upon the strength of the recovery of economic conditions in Europe. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of operating, investing and financing activities. Capital refers to our long-term financial resources available to support the business operations and contribute to future growth. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of the businesses, timing of cash flows on investments and products, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein. 
    
  Liquidity Management  
    
  Our principal available sources of liquidity are annuity product charges, GICs, funding agreements and fixed annuity deposits, investment income, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments, proceeds from debt issuance and borrowing facilities, repurchase agreements, securities lending, reinsurance and capital contributions. Primary uses of these funds are payments of commissions and operating expenses, interest and premium credits, payments under guaranteed death and living benefits, investment purchases, repayment of debt and contract maturities, withdrawals and surrenders and payment of dividends. 
    
  Our liquidity position is managed by maintaining adequate levels of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As part of the liquidity management process, different scenarios are modeled to determine whether existing assets are adequate to meet projected cash flows. Key variables in the modeling process include interest rates, equity market movements, quantity and type of interest and equity market hedges, anticipated contract owner behavior, market value of the general account assets, variable separate account performance and implications of rating agency actions. 
    
  The fixed account liabilities are supported by a general account portfolio, principally composed of fixed rate investments with matching duration characteristics that can generate predictable, steady rates of return. The portfolio management strategy for the fixed account considers the assets available-for-sale. This strategy enables us to respond to changes in market interest rates, prepayment risk, relative values of asset sectors and individual securities and loans, credit quality outlook and other relevant factors.  The objective of portfolio management is to maximize returns, taking into account interest rate and credit risk, as well as other risks. Our asset/liability management discipline includes strategies to minimize exposure to loss as interest rates and economic and market conditions change. In executing this strategy, we use derivative instruments to manage these risks. Our derivative counterparties are of high credit quality. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Additional sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities to meet short-term cash requirements that arise in the ordinary course of business. We maintain the following agreements: 

A reciprocal loan agreement with Voya Financial, Inc., an affiliate, whereby either party can borrow from the other up to   3.0%   of our statutory net admitted assets as of the preceding   December 31  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did   no  t have an outstanding receivable/payable from/to Voya Financial, Inc. under the reciprocal loan agreement. We and Voya Financial, Inc. continue to maintain the reciprocal loan agreement and future borrowings by either party will be subject to the reciprocal loan terms summarized above. Effective January 2014, interest on any borrowing by either the Company or Voya Financial, Inc. is charged at a rate based on the prevailing market rate for similar third-party borrowings or securities. 

We hold approximately   47.5%   of our assets in marketable securities. These assets include cash, U.S. Treasuries, Agencies, Corporate Bonds, ABS, CMBS, collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMO") and Equity securities. In the event of a temporary liquidity need, cash may be raised by entering into repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or security lending agreements by temporarily lending securities and receiving cash collateral. Under our Liquidity Plan, up to   12.0%   of our general account statutory admitted assets may be allocated to repurchase, securities lending and dollar roll programs. At the time a temporary cash need arises, the actual percentage of admitted assets available for repurchase transactions will depend upon outstanding allocations to the three programs. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had securities lending obligations of   $142.5 million   and   $153.6 million  , respectively, which, for both periods, represents approximately   0.2%   of our general account statutory admitted assets.  
       
  Management believes that our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our short-term cash obligations. 

Capital Contributions and Dividends 
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did   no  t receive any capital contributions from our Parent.  
    
  On June 9, 2016, we declared an ordinary dividend in the amount of   $373.0 million  , which was paid to our Parent on June 27, 2016. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we paid an ordinary dividend in the amount of   $394.0 million   to our Parent. 
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we declared and paid an extraordinary distribution in the amount of   $98.0 million   to our Parent. 
    
  Reinsurance Agreements 
    
  Reinsurance Ceded  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total reserves ceded to affiliates were   $6.0 billion   and   $5.0 billion  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , premiums ceded to affiliates were   $158.5 million   and   $357.2 million  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , premiums ceded to affiliates were   $75.9 million   and   $325.4 million  , respectively.   
    
  Guaranteed Living Benefit   Coinsurance and Coinsurance Funds Withheld 
    
  Prior to July 1 2016, we had an amended and restated automatic reinsurance agreement with an affiliate, Security Life of Denver International Limited ("SLDI"), on a combined coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld basis.  
    
  Effective July 1, 2016, SLDI acquired Roaring River II, Inc. ("RRII"), a Missouri life reinsurance captive, from its affiliate, ReliaStar Life Insurance Company, and also effective July 1, 2016, RRII redomesticated from the State of Missouri to the State of Arizona.  Effective July 1, 2016, we, SLDI and RRII entered into release, consent and novation agreements pursuant to which RRII assumed the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits previously reinsured to SLDI under the automatic reinsurance agreement; the services agreement from SLDI under which we provide certain actuarial risk modeling consulting services to SLDI with respect to hedge positions undertaken by SLDI in connection with the automatic reinsurance agreement; and SLDI's obligation to serve as asset manager for the funds withheld account under the asset management services agreement. 
    
  The impacts of these agreements on the Condensed Balance Sheets  as of the dates indicated are as follows: 

(1)    Included in Funds held under reinsurance treaties with affiliates on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
   (2)    Included in Deposits and reinsurance recoverable on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
   (3)    Included in Other assets on the Condensed Balance Sheets. 
    
  Reinsurance Assumed    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , total reserves assumed from affiliates were   $424.2 million   and   $438.7 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , premiums assumed from affiliates were   $111.9 million   and   $326.7 million  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , premiums assumed from affiliates were   $107.1 million   and   $318.2 million  , respectively.  
    
  Deposits Receivable  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , deposits receivable from affiliates were   $157.1 million   and   $155.3 million  , respectively.  

For further information regarding our reinsurance agreements with affiliates, refer to the Related Party Transactions Note in the Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Ratings  
    
  Our access to funding and our related cost of borrowing, requirements for derivatives collateral posting and the attractiveness of certain of our products to customers are affected by our credit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Financial strength ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. The credit ratings are also important for the ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing.  
    
  A downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings or the credit or financial strength ratings of our Parent or rated affiliates could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees or Letters of Credit ("LOCs"), cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and/or impair our relationships with creditors, distributors or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity and/or capital. In addition, we consider nonperformance risk in determining the fair value of our liabilities. Therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings or the credit or financial strength ratings of our Parent or rated affiliates may affect the fair value of our liabilities.  
    
  Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 
    
  Our financial strength and credit ratings as of the date of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   are summarized in the following table. In parentheses, following the initial occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that rating's relative rank within the agency's rating categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such generic or major category. For each rating, the relative position of the rating within the relevant rating agency's ratings scale is presented, with "1" representing the highest rating in the scale.

(1)    A.M. Best s financial strength rating is an independent opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. It is based on a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company's balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile.   
   (2)    Fitch s financial strength ratings provide an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The National Insurer Financial Strength ("IFS") Rating is assigned to the insurance company's policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts.  
   (3)    Moody s financial strength ratings are opinions of the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations.  Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. 
   (4)    S P s insurer financial strength rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. A "+" or "-" indicates relative strength within a category.  

Our ratings by A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best"), Fitch, Moody's and S P reflect a broader view of how the financial services industry is being challenged by the current economic environment, but also are based on the rating agencies' specific views of our financial strength. In making their ratings decisions, the agencies consider past and expected future capital and earnings, asset quality and risk, profitability and risk of existing liabilities and current products, market share and product distribution capabilities and direct or implied support from parent companies.  
    
  Rating agencies use an "outlook" statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. For an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12 to 18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. For a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change.  
    
  Ratings actions affirmation and outlook changes by S P, Moody's, Fitch and A.M. Best from December 31, 2015 through   September 30, 2016   and subsequently through the date of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   are as follows:  

On September 20, 2016, Fitch affirmed Voya Financial, Inc.'s long-term issuer credit rating, senior debt ratings and junior subordinated debt rating. Fitch also affirmed the financial strength ratings of the U.S. operating entities, including us. The rating outlook for all ratings is Stable. 
                
    On June 29, 2016, S P affirmed Voya Financial, Inc.'s long-term issuer credit and senior debt ratings at "BBB" and its junior subordinated debt rating at 'BB+'.  The financial strength ratings of the U.S. operating entities, including us, were also affirmed at "A". The rating outlook for all ratings is Stable. 
                
    On April 8, 2016, Fitch affirmed Voya's long-term issuer credit rating at 'BBB+', its senior debt rating at 'BBB' and its junior subordinated debt rating at 'BB+'. The financial strength ratings of the U.S. operating entities, including us, were also affirmed at "A". The rating outlook for all ratings is Stable. 
       
  Net Amount at Risk ("NAR") 
    
  Minimum Guarantees    
    
  Variable annuity contracts containing minimum guaranteed death and living benefits expose us to equity risk. A decrease in the equity markets may cause a decrease in the account values, thereby increasing the possibility that we may be required to pay amounts to contract owners due to guaranteed death and living benefits.  An increase in the value of the equity markets may increase account values for these contracts, thereby decreasing our risk associated with guaranteed death and living benefits. 
    
  As of the dates indicated, the guaranteed value of death benefits in excess of account values, was estimated to be as follows: 

The decrease in the guaranteed value of these death benefits was primarily driven by an increase in equity markets which resulted in favorable fund performance net of deductions for fees during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The additional liabilities recognized related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDB"), as of the dates indicated, were as follows: 

(1)     Refer to the   Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   Note in Part II, Item 8. in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on the methodology used to calculate the additional liability. 

The decrease in the additional separate account liability is mainly due to decrements and fees offsetting favorable fund performance. The decrease in the additional liability balance is mainly due to fees offsetting the favorable fund performance.  
    
  The following guaranteed living benefits information is as of the dates indicated: 

(1)     Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit ("GMAB")/Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit ("GMWB") 
   (2)     Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit ("GMIB")/Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit for Life ("GMWBL") 
    
  The net amount at risk for the reinsured living benefits is equal to the excess of the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contract holder over the current account value. The methodology used to calculate the net amount at risk partially reflects the current interest rate environment and also includes a provision for the expected mortality of the clients covered by these living benefits. The increase in the net amount at risk of these living benefits (GMIB/GMWBL) from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by lower interest rates.  
    
  The net amount at risk for the non-reinsured living benefits is equal to the guaranteed value of these benefits in excess of the account values, which is reflected in the table above.  
    
  The separate account liabilities subject to the requirements for additional reserve liabilities under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 944 for minimum guaranteed benefits and the additional liabilities recognized related to minimum guarantees, by type, as of the dates indicated, were as follows: 

(1)     Refer to the   Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   Note in Part II, Item 8. in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on the methodology used to calculate these additional liabilities. 
   (2)     The additional liability balance, net of reinsurance, for GMIB was zero as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The increase in the additional liability balance for reinsured living benefits corresponds to the increase in the GMWBL liability, which increased mainly due to a decrease in the interest rates during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Variable Annuity Hedge Program 
    
  Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program 
    
  We primarily mitigate variable annuity market risk exposures through hedging. Market risk arises primarily from the minimum guarantees within the variable annuity products, whose economic costs are primarily dependent on future equity market returns, interest rate levels, equity volatility levels and policyholder behavior. The Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program is used to mitigate our exposure to equity market and interest rate changes and seeks to ensure that the required assets are available to satisfy future death benefit and living benefit obligations. While the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program does not explicitly hedge  

statutory or U.S. GAAP reserves, as markets move up or down, in aggregate the returns generated by the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program will significantly offset the statutory and U.S. GAAP reserve changes due to market movements. 
    
  Variable Annuity Capital Hedge Overlay ("CHO") Program 
    
  Variable annuity guaranteed benefits are hedged based on their economic or fair value; however, the statutory reserves and rating agency required assets are not based on a market value. When equity markets decrease, the statutory reserve and rating agency required assets for the variable annuity guaranteed benefits can increase more quickly than the value of the derivatives held under the Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge Program. This causes regulatory reserves to increase and rating agency capital to decrease.  The CHO program is intended to mitigate market risk to the regulatory and rating agency capital of the Company.  
    
  For further information on our Variable Annuity Guarantee Hedge and Variable Annuity CHO programs, see   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Derivatives 
    
  Our use of derivatives is limited mainly to economic hedging to reduce our exposure to cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, credit risk, exchange rate risk and market risk. It is our policy not to offset amounts recognized for derivative instruments and amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. 
    
  We enter into interest rate, equity market, credit default and currency contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, caps, floors and options, to reduce and manage various risks associated with changes in value, yield, price, cash flow, or exchange rates of assets or liabilities held or intended to be held, or to assume or reduce credit exposure associated with a referenced asset, index, or pool. We also utilize options and futures on equity indices to reduce and manage risks associated with our annuity products.  Open derivative contracts are reported as Derivatives assets or liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in Other net realized capital gains (losses) in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  We also have investments in certain fixed maturities and have issued certain annuity products, that contain embedded derivatives whose fair value is at least partially determined by levels of or changes in domestic and/or foreign interest rates (short-term or long-term), exchange rates, prepayment rates, equity markets, or credit ratings/spreads. Embedded derivatives within fixed maturities are included with the host contract on the Condensed Balance Sheets and changes in fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded in Other net realized capital gains (losses) in the Condensed Statements of Operations. Embedded derivatives within certain annuity products are included in Future policy benefits and contract owner account balances on the Condensed Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded in Other net realized capital gains (losses) in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  In addition, we have entered into coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that contain embedded derivatives, the fair value of which is based on the change in the fair value of the underlying assets held in trust. Embedded derivatives within coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements are reported with the host contract in Deposits and reinsurance recoverable (assumed reinsurance) or Funds held under reinsurance treaties with affiliates (ceded reinsurance) on the Condensed Balance Sheets, and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded in Interest credited and other benefits to contract owners/policyholders in the Condensed Statements of Operations. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  We have obligations for the return of non-cash collateral under an amendment to our securities lending program. Non-cash collateral received in connection with the securities lending program may not be sold or re-pledged by our lending agent, except in the event of default, and is not reflected on our Condensed Balance Sheets. For information regarding obligations under this program, see the   Investments   Note in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additionally, for changes in commitments related to securities, mortgage loans, or money market instruments, see the   Commitments and Contingencies   Note in our Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1. of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than the above, there have been no material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments  
    
  In 2015, the NAIC Financial Condition (E) Committee (the "E Committee") established the Variable Annuities Issues (E) Working Group ("VAIWG") to oversee the NAIC's efforts to study and address, as appropriate, regulatory issues resulting in variable annuity captive reinsurance transactions.  In November 2015, upon the recommendation of the VAIWG, the E Committee adopted a preliminary framework, the Variable Annuities Framework for Change (the "VA Framework for Change") which recommends charges for NAIC working groups to adjust the variable annuity statutory framework applicable to all insurers that have written or are writing variable annuity business. The VA Framework for Change contemplates a holistic set of reforms that would improve the current VA reserve and capital framework and address root cause issues that result in the use of captive arrangements but would not mandate recapture of VA cessions to captives. In November 2015, the VAIWG engaged Oliver Wyman to conduct a quantitative impact study involving industry participants including the Company, of various reforms outlined in the VA Framework for Change (the "QIS"). OW completed the QIS in July of this year and reported its initial findings to the VAIWG in late August. The OW report proposes certain revisions to the current VA reserve and capital framework and recommends a second quantitative impact study be conducted so that testing can inform the proper calibration for certain conceptual and/or preliminary parameters set out in the OW proposal. The VAIWG has exposed for comment, until November 14, 2016, the OW report on the QIS and OW VA framework recommendations. The VAIWG s initial goal was to complete all of its work in 2016; however, it was announced at the NAIC Summer meeting that more time is needed for the VAIWG and other NAIC committees to consider and fully vet OW s recommendations and to develop the NAIC s proposals regarding revisions to the current VA reserve and capital framework. Although the revised timetable indicates the VAIWG expects to complete its work in 2017, with the goal that its work product becomes effective as of January 1, 2018, timing remains uncertain. We cannot predict what revisions, if any, will be made to the current VA reserve and capital framework or the impact of VA framework revisions on variable annuity captives, given the ongoing deliberations by the VAIWG and other NAIC working groups and a possible second quantitative impact study. It is also unclear whether VAIWG or other proposals will be adopted by the NAIC, or what additional actions and regulatory changes will result from continued variable annuity captives scrutiny and reform efforts by the NAIC and other regulatory bodies.

Item 4.        Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company required to be disclosed in the Company's periodic SEC filings is made known to them in a timely manner. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the   quarter   ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 31.1 
    
  CERTIFICATION 
    
  I, David P. Wiland, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this   quarterly   report on Form   10-Q   of Voya Insurance and Annuity Company; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
