  NOTE A - ORGANIZATION 
 
  Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the "Fund") was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as of October 15, 2003, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes ("Operating Partnerships"). The general partner of the Fund is Boston Capital Associates V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.  The members of the general partner are Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, and John P. Manning, who is the managing member.  Additional managers of the general partner are Jeffrey H. Goldstein and Marc N. Teal.  The general partner of Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership is Boston Capital Partners II Corporation whose sole shareholder is John P. Manning.  John P. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.   
 
 The assignor limited partner is BCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is wholly-owned by John P. Manning. The assignor limited partner was formed for the purpose of serving in that capacity for the Fund and will not engage in any other business. Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner will be assigned by the assignor limited partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") to investors and investors will be entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund, including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund. 
 
 A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the "Prospectus") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ("Offering") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC.  On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  As of September 30, 2016, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs representing capital contributions of $117,777,060. 
 
 Below is a summary of the BACs sold and total equity raised, by series, as of September 30, 2016: 

The Fund concluded its public offering of BACs in the Fund on April 29, 2005.

  NOTE B - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES 
 
  The condensed financial statements herein as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and six months then ended have been prepared by the Fund, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Fund accounts for its investments in Operating Partnerships using the equity method, whereby the Fund adjusts its investment cost for its share of each Operating Partnership's results of operations and for any distributions received or accrued.  Costs incurred by the Fund in acquiring the investments in the Operating Partnerships are capitalized to the investment account. 
 
 The Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include adjustments in interim periods considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Fund's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  
 
  Amortization 
 
  Acquisition costs were amortized on the straight-line method over 27.5 years. Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2016 of $47,842 for Series 47, $54,923 for Series 48 and $46,810 for Series 49.  Impairment losses have been recognized for the year ended March 31, 2015 of $418,353 for Series 47, $168,065 for Series 48 and $33,896 for Series 49.  As of March 31, 2016, the lives of the remaining acquisition costs were reassessed and determined to be 1 year for Series 49.  As of March 31, 2016, acquisition costs were fully amortized or impaired for Series 47 and Series 48.  
   
 Accumulated amortization of acquisition costs by Series for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

The remaining acquisition costs are expected to be amortized in the year ending March 31, 2017.

 NOTE C - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
  The Fund has entered into several transactions with various affiliates of the general partner, including Boston Capital Holdings Limited Partnership, Boston Capital Securities, Inc., and Boston Capital Asset Management L.P. as follows: 
 
 An annual fund management fee of .5 percent of the aggregate cost of all apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships has been accrued to Boston Capital Asset Management L.P.  Since reporting fees collected by the various series were added to reserves and not paid to Boston Capital Asset Management L.P., the amounts accrued are not net of reporting fees received.  The fund management fee accrued for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

The fund management fees paid for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

The fund management fees paid for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

NOTE D - INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIPS 
 
  At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Fund had limited partnership interests in 48 and 50 Operating Partnerships, respectively, which own or are constructing apartment complexes. The breakdown of Operating Partnerships within the Fund at September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Under the terms of the Partnership's investment in each Operating Partnership, the Fund was required to make capital contributions to the Operating Partnerships.  These contributions were payable in installments over several years upon each Operating Partnership achieving specified levels of construction and/or operations.

  NOTE D - INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIPS (CONTINUED) 
    
   During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Fund disposed of two and zero Operating Partnerships, respectively.  A summary of the dispositions by Series for September 30, 2016 is as follows:

The gain (loss) described above is for financial statement purposes only.  There are significant differences between the equity method of accounting and the tax reporting of income and losses from Operating Partnership investments. The largest difference is the ability, for tax purposes, to deduct losses in excess of the Partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the amount of gain recognized for tax purposes may be significantly higher than the gain recorded in the financial statements. 
    
  The Fund's fiscal year ends March 31st for each year, while all the Operating Partnerships' fiscal years are the calendar year.  Pursuant to the provisions of each Operating Partnership Agreement, financial results for each of the Operating Partnerships are provided to the Fund within 45 days after the close of each Operating Partnership's quarterly period.  Accordingly, the financial results available for the Operating Partnerships are for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

 NOTE E - TAXABLE LOSS 
 
  The Fund's taxable loss for the calendar year ended December 31, 2016 is expected to differ from its loss for financial reporting purposes.  This is primarily due to accounting differences in depreciation incurred by the Operating Partnerships and also differences between the equity method of accounting and the IRS accounting methods.  
   
  NOTE F - INCOME TAXES 
    
 The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.  Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.  The Fund's federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership.  Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.  The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.  Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2012 remain open. 
   
  NOTE G - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
 Events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were available to be issued must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.  The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that existed after the balance sheet date, require disclosure in the accompanying notes.  Management evaluated the activity of the Fund through the date the financial statements were issued, and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. 
   
 Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations 
   
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are  forward looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. 
  
 Liquidity 
 
  The Fund's primary source of funds is the proceeds of the Offering. Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions held pending investment and on working capital and (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund has and will invest.  The Fund does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships. 
   
 The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee.  Fund management fees accrued during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $265,659 and total fund management fees accrued as of September 30, 2016 were $7,459,193. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, none of the accrued fund management fees were paid.  Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Fund receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships, which will be used to satisfy these liabilities.  The Fund's working capital and sources of liquidity coupled with affiliated party liability accruals allow sufficient levels of liquidity to meet the third party obligations of the Fund.  The Fund is currently unaware of any trends which would create insufficient liquidity to meet future third party obligations of the Fund. 
 
  Capital Resources 
 
  The Fund offered BACs in the Offering declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 2, 2004.  The Fund received $34,783,340, $22,993,720 and $60,000,000 representing 3,478,334, 2,299,372 and 6,000,000 BACs from investors admitted as BAC Holders in Series 47, Series 48 and Series 49, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. 
   
  Series 47 
    
 The Fund commenced offering BACs in Series 47 on January 2, 2004.  Offers and sales of BACs in Series 47 were completed on April 30, 2004.

  Results of Operations 
 
  As of September 30, 2016, the Fund held limited partnership interests in 48 Operating Partnerships.  In each instance the apartment complex owned by the applicable Operating Partnership is eligible for the federal housing tax credit.  Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as "Qualified Occupancy."  Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable report on Form 8-K.  The general partner of the Fund believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties. 
   
 The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of certain asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. The fund management fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

The Fund's investment objectives do not include receipt of significant cash distributions from the Operating Partnerships in which it has invested or intends to invest.  The Fund's investments in Operating Partnerships have been and will be made principally with a view towards realization of federal housing tax credits for allocation to its partners and BAC holders.  
 
  Series 47 
 
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average Qualified Occupancy was 100%.  The series had a total of 14 properties at September 30, 2016, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy.   
   
 For the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Series 47 reflects a net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(69,048) and $(424,026), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $964,489 and $1,085,074, respectively.  This is an interim period estimate; it is not indicative of the final year-end results. 
   
 CP Continental L.P. (Time Square on the Hill) is a 200-unit family development located in Fort Worth, TX. Due to low rental rates and high operating expenses, the property operates below breakeven. However, the year-to-date operating deficit is lower than prior years due to increased rental income. The investment general partner will continue to work with the operating general partner and the management company to monitor and improve operations.  The operating general partner's operating deficit guarantee is unlimited in time and up to $542,490. The 15-year low income tax credit compliance period with respect to CP Continental expires on December 31, 2019. 
   
 McEver Vineyards, L.P. (McEver Vineyards Apartments) is a 220-unit family property in Gainesville, GA.  Due to high operating expenses, burdensome debt service and insufficient rental rates the property operated below breakeven from 2006 - 2015.  The investment general partner worked with the operating general partner and the management company in an attempt to improve operations.  Whether the operating general partner's operating deficit guarantee had expired was disputed by the operating general partner and the investment general partner. Nevertheless, operating deficits were partially financed by advances from the operating general partner during the past several years.  The 15-year low income tax credit compliance period with respect to McEver Vineyards, LP expires on December 31, 2019.  The operating general partner signed a letter of intent in December 2015 and a subsequent purchase and sale agreement in January 2016 to sell the property to a buyer who agreed to manage the property compliant with the requirements of Section 42 and sign a post transfer compliance and indemnity agreement and a personal guaranty.  The subject property sale was completed on April 8, 2016.  Although there were no distributable proceeds to the investment limited partners from the sale, the buyer of the property did execute a post transfer compliance   indemnity agreement, and a personal guaranty at closing preventing a foreclosure and mitigating the risk of recapture costs for the investment limited partners.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, no gain or loss on the sale of the Operating Partnership has been recorded as of June 30, 2016.  
    
 Park Plaza Village Limited Partnership (Park Plaza Village Apartments) is a 14-unit family property in Temple, OK.  Due to fluctuating occupancy and high expenses in 2014, the property operated below breakeven.  The property operated above breakeven in 2015, but occupancy continues to fluctuate averaging only 86% for the year.  The investment general partner will continue to work with the operating general partner and the management company to monitor and improve operations. The operating general partner's operating deficit guarantee expired on August 31, 2014.  The 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period with respect to Park Plaza Village, LP expires on December 31, 2018.   
   
 Hillsboro Fountainhead, L.P. (Pecan Creek Apartments) is a 48-unit family property in Hillsboro, Texas. Due to low occupancy, insufficient rental income and high operating expenses, the property continues to operate below breakeven. The investment general partner will continue to work closely with the operating general partner and the affiliated management company to improve operations. The operating general partner's operating deficit guarantee has expired; however, operating general partner continues to fund deficits through advances and by accruing management fees. The 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period with respect to Hillsboro Fountainhead, L.P., expires on December 31, 2019.

 For the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Series 48 reflects a net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(1,699) and $(156,882), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $538,218 and $657,416, respectively.  This is an interim period estimate; it is not indicative of the final year-end results. 
   
 CTP Limited Partnership (Contempo Apartments) is a 48-unit family property in Hammond, LA.  In August 2016, heavy rains caused flash flooding in the area. Of the total 48 units, 32 were severely damaged and are no longer able to be occupied.  These same units were impacted by the March 2016 floods and were fully repaired and occupied at the time of the most recent flooding.  As of September 30, 2016, the property was 33% occupied.   All 16 non-damaged units are occupied.  An adjuster visited the property and a claim has been made and is expected to be around $500,000.  All unit demolition has been completed and initial repairs have started.  Management expects all units to be back online by the end of October 2016 and all units re-occupied by the end of November 2016. The operating general partner's operating deficit guarantee has expired. The 15-year low income tax credit compliance period with respect to CTP Limited Partnership expires on December 31, 2019.

 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
 None. 

Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.  The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund's financial condition and results of operations.  The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. 
   
 The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.  The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships. The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments. 
   
 If the book value of the Fund's investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
   
 The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.  In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments. However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended, March 31, 2016 and 2015. However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated. 
     
   In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.  A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.   

Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates - continued 
    
 Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.  However, management does not consolidate the Fund's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.  The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Fund's balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on the investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.  The Fund's exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncement 
    
 In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures. ASU 2015-02 simplified and improves GAAP by: eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, eliminating the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Fund has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of Boston Capital Associates V LLC, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund's  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
