SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking
statements  as defined under United States federal securities
laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements about: 

our ability to market, commercialize and achieve
broader market acceptance for our products; 

our ability to successfully expand, and achieve full productivity
from, our sales, clinical support and
marketing capabilities;

regulatory clearance or approval for, our products;
and 

the estimates regarding the sufficiency of our cash resources, our
ability to obtain additional capital or our ability to maintain or
grow sources of revenue. 

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms
such as  anticipates,   believes, 
 could,   estimates, 
 expects,   intends,   may, 
 plans,   potential, 
 predicts,   projects,

similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain
these words. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis
for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly
Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a
combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our
projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. You
should also refer to the section of our Annual report on Form 10-K
entitled  Risk Factors  for a discussion of important
factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. As a
result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report will prove to
be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove
to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the
significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you
should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty
by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and
plans in any specified time frame, or at all. We do not undertake
to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 - Organization
and Significant Accounting Policies  

Description of Business 

MedoveX
Corp. (the  Company  or  MedoveX ), was
incorporated in Nevada on July 30, 2013 as SpineZ Corp.
( SpineZ ) and changed its name to MedoveX Corp. on
March 20, 2014. MedoveX is the parent company of Debride Inc.
( Debride ), which was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Florida on October 1, 2012. 

On
March 9, 2015, the Board of Directors of MedoveX and Streamline,
Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( Streamline ), approved
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger
Agreement ). On March 24, 2015, Streamline shareholders
approved the Merger Agreement and the transaction closed
immediately thereafter. Under the Merger Agreement, STML Merger
Sub, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of MedoveX, merged with
Streamline, and thus Streamline became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
MedoveX. Streamline is in the business of designing, developing,
manufacturing and marketing 510(k) and 510(k) exempt products for
use in the medical field. 

In May
2016, the Board of Directors authorized Management to seek buyers
for Streamline, Inc., the Company s wholly owned subsidiary
acquired in March 2015. See Note 10. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MedoveX
Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Streamline. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Unaudited interim results 

The
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016,
consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, statement of changes in
stockholders  equity for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and the statements of cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the
opinion of management, reflect all adjustments which included
normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and
results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial data and other
information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements related to the three and nine month periods are
unaudited. The results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other
interim period or for any future year. 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared based upon SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for
interim periods. For a more complete discussion of significant
accounting policies and certain other information, please refer to
the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements
reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation
of results of operations and financial condition for the interim
periods shown, including normal recurring accruals and other
items. 

-5- 

Use of Estimates 

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires
disclosure regarding estimates and assumptions used by management
that affect the amounts reported in financial statements and
accompanying notes. The Company s significant estimates
include the fair value, useful life, carrying amount and impairment
of its patented technology, the deferred income tax asset and the
related valuation allowance, and the fair value of its share based
payment arrangements. 

For
those estimates that are sensitive to the outcome of future events,
actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company s cash balances at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 consists of funds deposited in checking accounts with
commercial banks. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist solely of cash. At times
throughout the year, the Company may maintain certain bank account
balances in excess of FDIC insured limits. 

At
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company had cash
deposits that exceeded federally insured deposit
limits. 

The
Company believes that its funds are deposited in high credit
quality financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts to date and believes it is not exposed to
any significant credit risk associated with its cash
deposits. 

Goodwill And Purchased Intangible Assets 

Goodwill is
reviewed for impairment annually on December 31st or more
frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events
suggest impairment exists using a two-step process. In step 1, the
fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying
value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is
recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the
goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the
Company would then complete step 2 in order to measure the
impairment loss. In step 2, the Company would calculate the implied
fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible
and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible
assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting
unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the
carrying value of goodwill, the Company would recognize an
impairment loss, in the period identified, equal to the difference.
See Note 11. 

Other
intangible assets consist of developed technology and a trademark.
The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment as changes in
circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining
value may not be recoverable. See Note 11. 

Amortization on the
intangibles was provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

Trademark                                             

5 years 

Developed
technology                         

7 years 

-6- 

Fair Value Measurements 

We
measure certain non-financial assets at fair value on a
non-recurring basis. These non-recurring valuations include
evaluating assets such as non-amortizing intangible assets for
impairment; allocating value to assets in an acquired asset group;
and applying accounting for business combinations. We use the fair
value measurement framework to value these assets and report the
fair values in the periods in which they are recorded or written
down. 

The
fair value measurement framework includes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure
fair values in three broad levels. These levels from highest to
lowest priority are as follows: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are
accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or
liabilities; 

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities or observable prices that are based on inputs not
quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data;
and 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs or valuation techniques that are used
when little or no market data is available. 

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a
measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires
judgment. Level 3 valuations often involve a higher degree of
judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of
various cost, market, or income valuation methodologies applied to
unobservable management estimates and assumptions.
Management s assumptions could vary depending on the asset or
liability valued and the valuation method used. 

Such
assumptions could include: estimates of prices, earnings, costs,
actions of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of
various valuation methods. We may also engage external advisors to
assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

Property and Equipment 

Property and
equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, generally three to five years. Repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. Improvements and betterments, which extend
the lives of the assets, are capitalized. 

Leases 

The
Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. The lease term commences on the date that the Company
takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property.
Deferred rent is included in non-current liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. 

Research and Development 

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Advertising 

The
Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, advertising costs were
approximately $107,000 and $166,000 respectively. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, advertising costs were
approximately $17,000 and $29,000, respectively. 

-7- 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
the ASC 718, Stock Compensation. ASC 718 addresses all forms of
share-based payment awards including shares issued under employee
stock purchase plans and stock incentive shares. Under ASC 718,
awards result in a cost that is measured at fair value on the
awards  grant date, based on the estimated number of awards
that are expected to vest and will result in a charge to
operations 

Income Taxes 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes,
which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. 

Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse. 

Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management
concludes it is more likely than not that the asset will not be
realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. 

The
standard addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
recorded in the financial statements. 

Under
ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an
uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the
tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. 

ASC 740 also
provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and
requires increased disclosures. As of December 31, 2015 and
September 30, 2016, the Company does not have a liability for
unrecognized tax uncertainties.   

The
Company s policy is to record interest and penalties on
uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company has not incurred any interest or
penalties relating to uncertain tax positions. 

The
Company s evaluation was performed for the tax years ending
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which remain subject to
examination by major tax jurisdictions as of September 30,
2016. The Company does not have any tax years that are no
longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-US income
tax examinations. 

Loss per Share 

Basic
loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted loss
per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number
of common shares plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding
using the treasury stock method. Any potentially dilutive
securities are anti-   dilutive
due to the Company s net losses. There is no difference
between the basic and diluted net loss per share. 3,506,281
warrants and 894,900 common stock options outstanding were
considered anti-dilutive at September 30, 2016. 1,474,783 warrants
and 380,000 common stock options were considered anti-dilutive at
September 30, 2015. 

-8- 

Business combinations 

The
Company completed an acquisition on March 25, 2015. This
transaction was recorded using guidelines provided by ASC 805,
 Business Combinations .
Following these guidelines, the consideration paid by MedoveX for
Streamline was measured on the date of acquisition. An independent
valuation of Streamline was performed using the discounted cash
flow method. 

Based
on the estimated value of Streamline, the consideration paid by
MedoveX and the tangible assets of Streamline, management
determined the intangible portion of the purchase price should be
assigned between developed technology, trademark, and
goodwill. 

Refer
to Note 4 for the summary of the purchase price allocation based on
the completion of the valuation of the assets and liabilities
assumed. 

Discontinued Operations 

As more
fully described in Note 9, in May 2016, management was authorized
to locate a buyer for Streamline Inc., the Company s wholly
owned subsidiary acquired in March 2015, by the Board of Directors.
Streamline s assets and liabilities have been reclassified as
held for sale for all periods presented and the results of
operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all
periods presented. See Note 9. 

reclassification 

Some
items in the prior period financial statements were reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation. Reclassifications had
no effect on prior period net income or shareholders 
equity. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued accounting standards update ( ASU ) ASU 2014-09,
 Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with
Customers  (ASU 2014-09) that requires companies to recognize
revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when companies
have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or
service. This update is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein
and requires expanded disclosures. The Company is currently
assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its
consolidated financial statements. 

In
April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest  
Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, to reduce the complexity of
having different balance sheet presentation requirements for debt
issuance costs and debt discounts and premiums.  The guidance requires
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
reported on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability.  ASU 2015-03 is
effective for public companies for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company has adopted the amendments of ASU 2015-03
effective September 30, 2016. 

In
November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the
presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and
liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. 

ASU
2015-17 is effective for public companies for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted
prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU
2015-17 will have on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The
core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the
assets and liabilities that arise from leases. ASU 2016-02 is
effective for public companies for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted prospectively or
retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will
have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3 - Property and Equipment 

Property and
equipment, net, consists of the following: 

Depreciation
expense amounted to $2,033 and $6,042, respectively, for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Depreciation expense
amounted to $1,657 and $4,798, respectively, for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Note 4 - Acquisition 

On
March 25, 2015, the Company acquired Streamline Inc. pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 9, 2015. As a result of
this transaction, Streamline, Inc. is now a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of

Stock-Based Compensation Plan 

2013 Stock Option Incentive Plan 

On
October 14, 2013, the MedoveX Corp. Board of Directors approved the
MedoveX Corp. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).
The Company may grant incentive stock options to employees and
non-statutory stock options to employees, consultants, and
directors for up to 1,150,000 shares of common stock. 

The
stock options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value
of the common stock on the date of the grant. The Plan gives full
authority for granting options, determining the type of options
granted, and determining the fair market value of the options to
the Plan Administrator. 

The
Company has the right, but not obligation, to repurchase any shares
obtained through exercise of an option from terminated Plan
participants. The Company has 90 days from the date of termination
to exercise its repurchase right. The Company must pay the Fair
Market Value ( FMV ) of the shares if the termination
was for any reason other than for cause, or the option price (if
less than FMV of the shares) if the termination is for cause. The
FMV is determined by the Plan Administrator on the date of
termination. 

On
January 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
issue options to purchase an aggregate of 214,900 shares of common
stock to certain employees, consultants, and directors. The stock
options vest as follows: 25% on the date of grant and 25% on each
of the next three years after the grant date. The options issued
are exercisable at a price of $0.95, which is equal to the market
value of the common stock on the date of the grant. 

On
August 17, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
issue options to purchase an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common
stock to certain directors. The stock options vest as follows: 50%
on the date of grant and 50% one year after the grant date. The
options are exercisable at a price of $1.20. The market value of
the common stock on the date of the grant was $1.28. This lead to
an immaterial amount related to a beneficial conversion
feature. 

We
utilize the Black-Scholes valuation method to recognize
compensation expense over the vesting period. The expected life
represents the period that our stock-based compensation awards are
expected to be outstanding. 

We use a simplified method provided in Securities
and Exchange Commission release,   Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
110,   which averages an award's
weighted average vesting period and contractual term for "plain
vanilla" share options. The expected volatility was estimated by
analyzing the historic volatility of similar public biotech
companies in an early stage of development.  

No
dividend payouts were assumed as we have not historically paid, and
do not anticipate paying, dividends in the foreseeable future. The
risk-free rate of return reflects the weighted average interest
rate offered for US treasury rates over the expected term of the
options. 

The
significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the
equity awards granted are; 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recognized approximately $230,000 and $562,000, respectively, as
compensation expense with respect to the stock options. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company
recognized approximately $76,000 and $179,000, respectively, as
compensation expense with respect to the stock
options.

to Steve Gorlin, a director and the father of Jarrett Gorlin, the
Company s CEO, for the principal amount of up to $2,000,000.
The loan principal was to be advanced in two installments of
$1,000,000 each, the first installment being made upon execution of
the promissory note and the second installment to be made by March
1, 2016. 

The
Convertible Note provided that the principal and accrued but unpaid
interest could be converted into common stock at $2 per share. The
outstanding principal was to earn interest at a rate of 5.5% per
annum and was to be paid quarterly. The Company also issued a 3

immediately convert the promissory note into an aggregate of
571,429 shares of its Common Stock, eliminating the Company s
$1,000,000 debt obligation and any accrued interest in exchange for
amending the conversion price of the promissory note from $2.00 per
share to $1.75 per share.

Gorlin also agreed to acquire 571,429 additional shares of Common
Stock at a price of $1.75 per share for a total purchase price of

-15- 

On
February 16, 2016, the Company and Steve Gorlin entered into an
Amendment to the Modification Agreement in order to reduce the
amount of shares of Common Stock that Mr. Gorlin was to receive
upon the conversion of the $1,000,000 promissory note from 571,429
($1.75 per share) shares to 552,041 ($1.81 per share) shares. In
consideration for reducing the amount of shares of common stock
that he was to receive, the Company agreed to reduce the exercise
price of Steven Gorlin s 500,000 share warrant from $2.00 per
share to $1.825 per share (see Note 8). This amendment to the
Modification Agreement was made to address certain concerns of the
NASDAQ. 

On March 15, 2016,
the Board of Directors approved a second amendment to the
Modification Agreement. The date for making the second installment
of $1,000,000 was extended to November 1,
2016.   

Additionally, the
language in the Note was changed to clarify that the consideration
received by the Company on the first installment was in the form of
$970,000 cash and $30,000 in directors  fees due to Mr. Steve
Gorlin. The $30,000 in directors  fees was recorded as a
reduction in equity and is expensed as earned. $10,000 of directors
fees were earned in 2015 after issuance of the note. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $5,000 and $15,000,
respectively, of directors  fees were earned by Mr. Gorlin to
reduce the balance outstanding to $5,000.

Company originally recorded both the convertible debt and the
accompanying warrant on a relative fair value basis of
approximately $715,000 and $285,000, respectively. The closing
price of the Company s stock on the day prior to issuing the
convertible debt was $1.75 per share. See Note 8 for the inputs
used to value the warrant as of the respective issue date. Steve
Gorlin was also granted piggyback registration rights with respect
to the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Note
and upon exercise of the warrants. 

Short Term Note Payable 

As
discussed in Note 5, on September 13, 2016, the Board of Directors
approved a resolution authorizing the Company to obtain a secured
nine-month term loan for the principal amount of $1,150,000. In
connection therewith, on September 16, 2016, the Company entered
into a Unit Purchase Agreement with selected accredited investors
whereby the Company had the right to sell units in a private
placement to secure the loan. 

Original Issuance Discount 

The
principal face value of the loan is $1,150,000 and was issued with
an original issuance discount of $150,000 which resulted in
aggregate proceeds of $1,000,000. The loan has a default interest
rate of 15% per year and a maturity date of June 16, 2017. The
Company is required to repay the principal amount of the loan
following the Company s receipt of any financing in aggregate
of $1,650,000 in the next six months. Additionally, investors have
the option to convert the $150,000 original issuance discount,
which will accrete over the life of the loan, and principal into
future financing or be paid back in cash. 

Warrants 

Warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 200,000 shares of common stock were issued
as part of the short term note agreement with a strike price of
$1.625 which was $0.125 above market with an exercise date six
months from the closing. The warrants must be exercised within
three years from the date of issuance. The Company recorded the
proceeds from the loan and the accompanying warrants on a relative
fair value basis of approximately $864,000 and $136,000,
respectively. The carrying amount has also been reduced by $5,000
related to debt issuance costs. The closing price of the
Company s stock on the day prior to entering into the
agreement was $1.50 per share. See Note 8 for the inputs used to
value the warrant as of the respective issue date. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the loan is being accreted to its $1,150,000
face amount over the 9 month period the loan will be outstanding.
The note is also presented net of the issuance costs of $5,000
which will accrete over the life of the note, based on the
effective interest method. Accretion expense for the three and nine
month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
$15,887.

As
described in Note 5, the Company issued warrants in connection with
the private placement in August 2016. The warrants are exercisable
for up to five years after six months following the date of
issuance. The fair value of the warrants at the date of issuance
were determined to be approximately $286,311 and $37,080,
respectively, for the issuance on August 5, 2016 and August 16,
2016. Fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton
valuation technique and were assigned based on the relative fair
value of both the common stock and the warrants issued.
 The
Company s fair value measurements of the warrants are
designated as Level 1 since all of the significant inputs were
observable, and quoted prices were available for the four
comparative companies in an active market.  

The inputs used to value the warrants as of the August 5, 2016
issuance date are as follows: 

The market price of the Company s stock on August 5, 2016 of
$1.35 

Exercise price of the warrant: $1.52

As
described in Note 5, the Company issued warrants in connection with
the receipt of the secured nine month term loan in September 2016.
The warrants are exercisable for up to three years after six months
following the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants at
the date of issuance were determined to be approximately $154,203.
Based on the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation technique, the Company
recorded the proceeds from the loan and the accompanying warrants
on a relative fair value basis of approximately $1,014,000 and
$136,000, respectively.  The Company s
fair value measurements of the warrants are designated as Level 1
since all of the significant inputs were observable, and quoted
prices were available for the four comparative companies in an
active market.  

-18- 

The inputs used to value the warrants as of the September 16, 2016
issuance date are as follows: 

The market price of the Company s stock on September 16, 2016
of $1.58 

Exercise price of the warrant: $1.625 

Life of the warrant: 3 years

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation
that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future fair values. Furthermore, the Company believes its valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to
determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting
date. 

Note 9   Discontinued operations 

In May
2016, the Board of Directors authorized Management to seek buyers
for Streamline, Inc., the Company s wholly owned subsidiary
acquired in March 2015. The Company seeks additional funds to
complete the development and launch of the Company s primary
product, the DenerveX device, and anticipates the sale to be
completed within one year. Selling this business unit could help
raise necessary funds to fund continuing operations of the Company
in a non-dilutive manner to existing shareholders.
Streamline s assets and liabilities have been reclassified as
held for sale for all periods presented. The operating results of
Streamline are included in discontinued operations for the periods
presented. Streamline is immediately available for sale in its
present condition. 

The
carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of
the discontinued operations available for sale are as
follows :  

-19- 

The
results of the discontinued operations, which represents
 Streamline s IV Suspension
System ( ISS ), are as follows:  

Cash
flows from discontinued operations are as follows: 

Amortization
expense related to the available for sale intangible assets for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $0
and $190,000, respectively. Amortization expense related to the
available for sale intangible assets for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $142,143 and 284,285,
respectively. 

Depreciation
expense amounted to $21 and $129, respectively, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Depreciation expense amounted
to $64 and $107, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

There
is no expected future amortization of the available for sale
intangible assets as of September 30, 2016. As further discussed in
Note 9, the recognition of amortization expense related to the
available for sale intangible assets ceased in May 2016 when the
Board of Directors authorized Management to seek buyers for
Streamline. 

Promissory Notes 

In
conjunction with the consummation of the Streamline acquisition on
March 25, 2015, the Company assumed two promissory notes for
approximately $135,000 and $125,000 to the Bank of North Dakota New
Venture Capital Program and North Dakota Development Fund, both
outside non-related parties. 

-20- 

Payments on both of
the notes are due in aggregate monthly installments of
approximately $5,700 and carry an interest rate of 5%. Both of the
notes have a maturity date of August 1,   2019. 

The
promissory notes had outstanding balances of approximately $189,000
and $223,000, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. 

Expected future
payments, including interest, related to the promissory notes as of
September 30, 2016, are approximately as follows: 

For the year
ended : 

The
Company paid interest expense related to the promissory notes for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of
approximately $800 and $6,100, respectively. The Company paid
interest expense related to the notes for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 in the amount of approximately $3,100 and
$5,100, respectively. The Company had unpaid accrued interest in
the amount of approximately $71,000 and $69,000, respectively, at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 related to the promissory
notes. 

Note 10   Impairment of intangible assets 

As discussed in Note 2, the Company reviews
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances  or occurrence of events suggest impairment
exists  in accordance with
FASB ASC 360.  

The Board of Directors decision to seek
buyers for Streamline, as discussed in Note 9,  was made
after management evaluated and determined potential impairment
indicators existed relating to poor operating performance as sales
are less than previously anticipated. The impact of the operating
losses incurred from the Streamline portion of the business
contributes significantly to the Company s operations and
financial results. As such, the Company separated the asset groups
accordingly between the amortizable intangible assets in developed
technology and trademark, and the non-amortizable intangible asset
in goodwill, and completed an impairment analysis using a two-step
process as described in Note 2. 

As a
result of the impairment analysis, the Company determined the
carrying value of the developed technology exceeded the calculated
fair value. Consequently, the Company recognized a write-down of
approximately $1,035,714 related to the developed technology in the
quarter ended June 30, 2016. The remaining $1,500,000 in developed
technology is classified as a held for sale current asset at
September 30, 2016 while the Company seeks a buyer for
Streamline. 

As a
result of the impairment analysis, the Company also determined the
carrying value of the trademark and goodwill exceeded the
calculated fair value. Consequently, impairment losses of
$6,455,645 and $548,333, respectively, were recognized in the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 related to goodwill and the trademark.
The impairment losses resulted in a complete write down of both
assets and, consequently, are not reported as of September 30,
2016. 

Note 11 - Income Taxes 

For the
period from February 1, 2013 (inception) to September 30, 2016, the
Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no current
income tax liability.  The net deferred tax asset
generated by these losses, which principally consist of start-up
costs deferred for income tax purposes, is fully reserved as of
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, since it is currently
more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized in
future periods. 

-21- 

The
Company is required to file federal income tax returns and state
income tax returns in the states of Florida, Georgia and Minnesota.
There are no uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2015 or
September 30, 2016. The Company has not undergone any tax
examinations since inception. 

Note 12 - Related-Party Transactions 

Aviation Expense 

Periodically the
Company may charter general aviation aircraft from TAG Aviation LLC
( TAG ), a company owned by Mr. Jarrett
Gorlin. 

The Company believes that such aircraft charter is
on terms no less favorable then it would receive from a third
party.  General aviation expenses paid to TAG for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were approximately $9,500
and $18,500, respectively. General aviation expenses paid to TAG
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was
approximately $15,000 and $26,000, respectively. 

Operating Lease 

As
described in Note 6, the Company pays TAG Aviation LLC,
( TAG ), a company owned by Mr. Gorlin, for month to
month rental of office space at Dekalb-Peachtree Airport in Atlanta
Georgia plus cost of utilities. Rent payments under this
arrangement were $1,800 per month through August 31, 2016.
Effective September 1, 2016, rent payments under this arrangement
increased to $2,000 per month. 

Rent
expense and utilities cost paid to TAG Aviation amounted to
approximately $7,300 and $22,000, respectively, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Rent expense and utilities
cost paid to TAG Aviation amounted to approximately $7,000 and
$21,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Consulting Expense 

On
December 2, 2013, the Company engaged a founding stockholder who
owns 375,000 shares of its common stock to provide the Company with
business development advisory services. Fees under this arrangement
included a $45,000 up-front payment that was non-refundable and
$10,000 per month for each month of services provided to the
Company under this arrangement. On January 1, 2015, this consulting
agreement was modified to increase the monthly compensation to
$35,000 through December 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the fee
was modified again to $5,000 per month through June 2016. Effective
August 1, 2016, the $5,000 per month fee was extended through
January 18, 2017. Either party could cancel this agreement upon 30
days  written notice. The Company paid $10,000 and $40,000,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 under this new arrangement. The Company paid $105,000 and
$315,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 under the previous arrangement. 

Convertible Debt 

As more
fully described in Note 7, on November 9, 2015, the Company issued
a convertible promissory note to Steve Gorlin, a related party, for
the principal amount of up to $2,000,000. 

Note 13 - Research and Development 

Devicix Prototype Design and Development Agreement 

In
November 2013, the Company accepted a proposal from Devicix, a
Minneapolis, Minnesota based FDA registered contract designer and
developer, to develop a commercially viable prototype of its
product that could be used to receive regulatory approval from the
FDA and other international agencies for use on humans to relieve
pain associated with Facet Joint Syndrome. Through September 30,
2016, the Company has paid approximately $1,406,000 to
Devicix. 

-22- 

The
development work commenced in December 2013. The total estimated
cost of this work at contract signing was $960,000; however, the
terms of the proposal allow either the Company or the designer and
developer to cancel the development work with 10-days 
notice. The Company incurred expenses of approximately $103,000 and
$340,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, of which approximately $48,000 was included in
accounts payable as of September 30, 2016. The Company incurred
expenses of approximately $89,000 and $326,000, respectively, for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, of which
approximately $4,000 was included in accounts payable as of
September 30, 2015. 

Denervex Generator Design, Development And Manufacturing
Agreement 

The
DenerveX device requires a custom electrocautery generator for
power. As described in Note 6, in November 2014, the Company
contracted with Bovie International to customize one of their
existing electrocautery generators for use with the DenerveX
Device, and then manufacture that unit on a commercial basis once
regulatory approval for the DenerveX was obtained. The Bovie
agreement requires a base $295,000 development fee to customize the
unit, plus additional amounts if further customization is necessary
beyond predetermined estimates. 

The
Company paid approximately $1,000 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 under this agreement. The Company paid
approximately $85,000 and $181,000, respectively, for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 under this agreement. Through
September 30, 2016, the Company has paid approximately $312,000 to
Bovie. 

The
original $295,000 agreement was a base number along the pathway of
development. Additional requirements were incurred as the research
and development process progressed and as a result certain prices
increased and additional costs were incurred. 

Nortech Manufacturing Agreement 

In
November 2014, the Company selected Nortech Systems Inc.
( Nortech ), a Minneapolis, Minnesota based FDA
registered contract manufacturer, to produce approximately 1,200
DenerveX devices from the prototype supplied by Devicix for use in
final development and testing. The agreement with Nortech includes
agreed upon per unit prices for delivery of the
devices. 

Actual
work on development of the final units began in November 2014. The
Company paid approximately $250,000 and $362,000, respectively, to
Nortech for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, of
which approximately $116,000 was included in accounts payable as of
September 30, 2016. Through September 30, 2016, the Company has
paid approximately $651,000 to Nortech. 

Note 14  Liquidity, Going Concern and Management s
Plans 

The
Company incurred a net loss of approximately $13,185,000 and
$4,765,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The Company will continue to incur losses until such
time as it can bring a sufficient number of approved products to
market and sell them with margins sufficient to offset expenses.

To
date, the Company s sole source of funds has been from the
issuance of debt and equity. 

In
January 2015, the underwriter for the public offering exercised the
overallotment of shares pursuant to the initial public offering,
netting another $1,084,000. 

As
discussed in Note 7, the Company issued a promissory note for up to
$2,000,000 of convertible debt on November 9, 2015 to Steve Gorlin,
a director and father of Jarrett Gorlin, the Company s CEO.
The Company received $970,000 in cash and the elimination of
$30,000 of future directors  fees upon execution of the
agreement. A second installment of $1,000,000 is expected to be
made by Mr. Steve Gorlin by December 1, 2016. 

-23- 

As
discussed in Note 5, in April 2016 and August 2016, a private
placement of common stock raised approximately $1,176,000 for the
Company, net of fees. 

As
discussed in Note 5, in September 2016, the Company raised
$1,000,000 in cash in the form of a secured short term note
payable. 

The
Company is exploring additional fundraising options for the
remainder of 2016. However, if the Company is unable to raise
sufficient financing, it could be required to undertake initiatives
to conserve its capital resources, including delaying or suspending
the development of its technology. There can be no assurances such
efforts to raise funding will be successful. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying
amounts of its assets or liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Note 15 - Subsequent Events 

On
November 1, 2016, the executive committee of the Board of Directors
unanimously approved a written consent extending the date Mr. Steve
Gorlin is to make the second installment of $1,000,000 to December
1, 2016. See Note 7.

ITEM 2. 

M ANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing
in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Historical results and
trends that might appear in this Quarterly Report should not be
interpreted as being indicative of future operations. 

Overview 

MedoveX Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in
Nevada on July 30, 2013 as Spinez Corp. MedoveX is the parent
company of Debride Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of
Florida on October 1, 2012, but did not commence operations until
February 1, 2013.  Spinez Corp. changed its name to
MedoveX Corp. and effected a 1-for-2 reverse split of its stock in
March 2014. 

The goal of the Company is to obtain, develop and commercialize
various intellectual property rights (patents, patent applications,
knowhow, etc.) in the medical technology area, with particular
focus on the development of medical devices. We intend to leverage
the extensive experience of our board of directors and management
team in the medical industry to seek out product candidates for
licensing, acquisition or development. 

DenerveX 

Our first acquisition was the DenerveX device.  We
believe that the DenerveX device can be developed for pain
relief.   

The Company acquired the DenerveX patent on January 31, 2013 from
Scott Haufe, M.D., a director of the Company, in exchange for
750,108 shares of common stock in the Company and a 1% royalty on
all sales of any product sold based on the patent. In September
2013, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with James
Andrews, M.D. ( Dr. Andrews ), a director of the
Company, whereby Dr. Andrews committed to further evaluate the
DenerveX device and to seek to make modifications and improvements
to such technology.  In exchange for such services, the
Company agreed to pay Dr. Andrews a royalty equal to two (2%)
percent of the DenerveX net sales during the five (5) year term of
the Co-Development Agreement. Upon the termination of the term of
the Co-Development Agreement, which has a minimum term of five (5)
years, the royalty payable to Dr. Andrews shall be reduced to one
(1%) percent of DenerveX net sales after such termination of
products covered by any U.S. patent on which Dr. Andrews is listed
as a co-inventor; if any such patents are obtained.  Such
one (1%) percent royalty shall continue during the effectiveness of
such patent.  Pursuant to the Co-Development Agreement,
Dr. Andrews agreed to assign any modifications or improvements to
the DenerveX to the Company subject to the royalty rights described
above. 

Our intention is to market the product as a disposable, single-use
kit which will include all components of the DenerveX product
kit. In addition to the DenerveX device itself, we are
developing a dedicated Electro Surgical Generator to power the
DenerveX device. The generator would be provided to customers
agreeing to purchase the DenerveX device kit and could not be used
for any other purpose. 

We accepted a proposal from Devicix, a Minneapolis, Minnesota third
party design and development firm, in November 2013, to develop a
prototype device. This proposal included a 5 phase development
plan, culminating in the production of a prototype that could be
used for validation purposes. Currently we are in the build and
final test phase of the device, which focuses on completing the
product design verification testing, design optimization as
required, and the completion of manufacturing transfer. Through
September 30, 2016, we have paid approximately $1,406,000 to
Devicix. 

In November 2014, we selected Nortech Systems Inc.
( Nortech ), a Minneapolis, Minnesota based FDA
registered contract manufacturer, to produce approximately 1,200
DenerveX devices from the prototype supplied by Devicix for use in
final development and testing. The agreement with Nortech includes
agreed upon per unit prices for delivery of the devices. Actual
work on development of the final units began in November 2014.
Through September 30, 2016, we have paid approximately $651,000 to
Nortech. 

-25- 

Also in November 2014, we engaged Bovie Medical Corporation
( Bovie ), a Delaware Corporation, to develop the
Electro Surgical Generator and provide post production support
services.  Per our agreement with Bovie, we are
invoiced based on deliverables produced by Bovie, which will amount
to $295,000 upon completion of all the deliverables. Through
September 30, 2016, we have paid approximately $312,000 to Bovie
towards the $295,000 total.   Development fees
beyond the predetermined estimate of $295,000 were incurred to
further customize the DenerveX device. Additional costs could be
incurred in the future if further customization is
necessary. 

In July
2015, we entered into a non-exclusive distribution center agreement
with Technology Consult Berlin GmbH ( TCB ) pursuant to
which TCB shall manage and coordinate the DenerveX products which
the Company exports to the European Union country
distributors. 

Also in
July 2015, we entered into an international distribution agreement
with EDGE Medical, a company organized and located in the United
Kingdom (the  UK ).  EDGE Medical is expected to provide
sales, marketing and distribution services for the various country
hospitals throughout the UK for the launch of the DenerveX
System.  

We entered into three more
international distribution agreements in August 2015. The first was
with German based Aureus  Medical f or the distribution of its DenerveX
System throughout Germany. Aureus Medical distributes spine and
pain management solutions in the spine
space.    

The
second distribution agreement was  with
Turkey based MEDS Medikal Ltd.  f or the distribution of the DenerveX
System throughout Turkey. MEDS Medikal Ltd. has been providing
sales, marketing and distribution services in the spine surgery
market space in Turkey since 1997, representing leading brands of
the world. The third distribution agreement entered into in August
2015 was with Sydney based Medical Innovators Pty. Ltd. for the
distribution of the DenerveX System throughout Australia and New
Zealand. The agreement will expand the market for us by leveraging
the Spine industry-leading marketing, sales, support and
distribution power of Medical Innovators Pty.
Ltd.  

Also in August 2015, we entered into two medical advisory board
agreements with European leading spine surgeons Dr. Martin Deeg and
Dr. Karsten Ritter-Lang. Under the terms of the agreements, both
doctors     will
leverage their expertise, experience and relationships in the spine
treatment space, specifically the facet joint pain area by advising
us on matters related to its technology and the area of facet joint
pain therapies. They will also provide services to help introduce
the DenerveX System to other leading physicians and medical
professionals. Through September 30, 2016, we have paid
approximately $9,500 to Dr. Martin Deeg.  

In November 2015 we entered into a medical advisory agreement
another leading European spine surgeon, Dr. Vik Kapoor of
Manchester, England. 

In April 2016, we entered into an international distribution
agreement with Innosurge, a supplier of innovative orthopedic
surgery equipment. The agreement covers the distribution of the
DenerveX System throughout Scandinavia, including Denmark, Sweden,
Norway and Finland. 

In August 2016, the Company hired Mr. Juan Davila as Director of
Sales   Marketing for the Latin-America market region. Mr.
Davila will be developing and implementing an overall corporate
sales and marketing strategy, directly engaging and managing all
future Medovex distributors throughout the Americas, and
translating the company's business objectives into marketing
strategies that drive future revenue. In addition, Mr. Davila will
also provide services to help introduce the Company s
DenerveX System to leading physicians and medical professionals in
Latin America. Through September 30, 2016, we have paid
approximately $2,500 to Mr. Davila. 

In September 2016, we entered into an international distribution
agreement with M. Fast Technologies LTD, a leading supplier of
innovative spine surgery products. The agreement covers the
distribution of the DenerveX System throughout Israel. 

The
Company has entered into some of the final stages of the
development and verification of the DenerveX Device and the
DenerveX power generator as a system. Final development, testing
and verification to set standards is the main focus for these final
stages. Additionally, the company will be testing the DenerveX
System in an extensive living tissue model under very strict Good
Laboratory Practice Standards to measure, verify, and establish
its  effectiveness for performance as a system. Other testing
will include device sterilization, shelf life verification and
shipping and performance testing to very specific standards. The
DenerveX power generator will also be safety tested by a world
leader in safety performance testing. SGS, a highly respected
testing and verification firm will test the DenerveX System using
an extensive set of testing standards.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements,
which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). 

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. 

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,
including those described in greater detail below. 

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Factors Which May Influence Future Results of
Operations 

The following is a description of factors that may influence our
future results of operations, and that we believe are important to
an understanding of our business and results of
operations. 

Revenue; Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 

The
Company s only sales of the Streamline ISS IV poles occurred
in December 2015. Customers placed purchase orders for the IV Poles
directly with the Company, which the Company subsequently placed
the order with Comdel to manufacture and assemble the IV Poles.
Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 75%.
These sales are included in discontinued operations. 

The Company did not sell any of the Streamline ISS IV poles during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or
2015. 

Operating Expenses 

We classify our operating expenses into four categories: research
  development, sales   marketing, general  
administrative, and depreciation   amortization. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid to
external service providers, laboratory supplies, costs for
facilities and equipment, and other costs for research and
development activities. 

Research and development expenses are recorded in operating
expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Estimates have
been used in determining the expense liability of certain costs
where services have been performed but not yet
invoiced. 

We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract
for external service providers, including the extent of patient
enrollment and other activities through communications with the
service providers to reflect the actual amount
expended. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Beginning in October 2013, the Company hired full time management,
began sourcing vendors, retained consultants and commenced other
activities consistent with a new operation. Prior to that time,
most activity focused on the Company s initial capital raise
under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and in securing
its initial product applications. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid approximately $392,000
and $1,189,000, respectively, in personnel costs. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid
approximately $381,000 and $998,000, respectively, in personnel
costs. 

-27- 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
paid approximately $309,000 and $1,102,000, respectively, in
professional fees, of which approximately $207,000 were Streamline
professional fees funding the working capital commitment. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid
approximately $506,000 and $1,967,000, respectively, in
professional fees, of which approximately $390,000 and $288,000,
respectively, were Streamline acquisition-related legal expenses
and professional fees funding the working capital commitment. For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,  the
Company paid approximately $50,000 and $130,000, respectively, in
travel expenses , of which
approximately $7,000 were Streamline travel expenses funding the
working capital commitment.   For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,  the
Company paid approximately $76,000 and $243,000, respectively, in
travel expenses , of which
approximately $19,000 were Streamline travel expenses funding the
working capital commitment.  

We paid
less in general and administrative expenses during the nine month
period ending September 30, 2016 versus the nine month period
ending September 30, 2015 primarily due to the fees incurred as
part of the consummation of the acquisition of Streamline as well
as the reduced Streamline working capital expenditures as we
continue to seek a buyer. We also continued to maintain a concerted
effort during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to
keep general and administrative expenses down due to lower working
capital balances. Outside of acquisition-related costs, general and
administrative expenses incurred continue to support research and
development activities, commercialization of our product candidate
as well as our continued overall costs of operating as a public
company. These fees have included increased costs related to the
hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants,
lawyers and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we
have continued to incur costs associated with being a public
company including expenses related to services associated with
maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and
Exchange Commission requirements, insurance, and investor relations
costs. 

Sales   Marketing Expenses 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
expensed approximately $107,000 and $166,000, respectively in sales
and marketing expenses. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company expensed approximately $17,000 and
$29,000 respectively in sales and marketing expenses. Sales and
marketing expense consists primarily of fees paid to vendors for
tradeshows and consultants in correlation with the pre-launch of
the DenerveX in Europe. 

Depreciation   Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense are recorded in the period in
which they are incurred. The Company recognized approximately
$2,000 and $6,000, respectively, in depreciation expense for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company
recognized approximately $1,700 and $4,700, respectively, in
depreciation expense for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recognized approximately $0 and $190,000, respectively, in
amortization expense.  The recognition of amortization
expense related to amortizable intangible assets ceased in May 2016
when the Board of Directors authorized Management to seek buyers
for Streamline.  The Company recognized
approximately $142,000 and $284,000, respectively, for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 in amortization
expense.  

Results of Discontinued Operations 

Our discontinued operations generated net losses of approximately
$2,040,000 and $288,000 for the nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The results of discontinued operations for the current period ended
September 30, 2016 include the write down of intangible assets
acquired with the purchase of Streamline Inc. in March 2015 that
was recorded in the six month period ended June 30, 2016. The
impairment loss recorded included a complete write down of the
acquired trademark of $548,000, and approximately $1,036,000 to
write-down the acquired developed technology.

Results of Continuing Operations 

Three and Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
201  5  

Total
operating expenses increased approximately $388,000, or 29%, to
approximately $1,736,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2016, as compared to approximately $1,348,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Total
operating expenses increased approximately $6,308,000, or 141%, to
approximately $10,784,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, as compared to approximately $4,477,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

The results of continuing operations for the current period ended
September 30, 2016 include a complete write down of $6,455,645 in
goodwill recorded in connection with the purchase of Streamline
Inc. in March 2015. 

The
increase in expenses over the prior year for same the period is
primarily the result of the impairment charges. Impairment charges
aside, we continued to incur similar Product development costs
associated with the DenerveX device as well as costs incurred
related to being a public entity. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 

To date
our operations have been funded with the issuance of debt and
equity. On November 9, 2015, we issued a convertible promissory
note to Steve Gorlin, a related party, for up to $2,000,000, the
principal to be advanced in two installments. We received $970,000
in cash and the reduction in obligation of $30,000 in
directors  fees on November 9, 2015. This $1,000,000 in debt
was subsequently converted into equity in January 2016, ultimately
in exchange for 552,041 shares of common stock. On March 15, 2016,
the Board of Directors approved extending the date for the second
installment of $1,000,000 to November 1, 2016. 

The
note payable presented on our September 30, 2016 balance sheet
represents a secured nine month term loan for the principal amount
of $1,150,000. In September 2016, we entered into a Unit Purchase
Agreement with selected accredited investors whereby we had the
right to sell units in a private placement to secure the loan. The
loan has a default interest rate of 15% per year and a maturity
date of June 16, 2017. The Company is required to repay the
principal amount of the loan following the Company s receipt
of any financing in aggregate of $1,650,000 in the next six
months. 

The
liabilities held for sale presented on our September 30, 2016
balance sheet is comprised of two promissory notes issued by
Streamline prior to our acquisition of that entity in March 2015.
The two notes total approximately $189,000 at September 30,
2016. 

Our
equity funding stems from both the private sale of common stock and
an initial public offering of common stock. Net of transaction
costs, we raised approximately $6,732,000 in the initial public
offering in December 2014, and approximately $1,084,000 from the
exercise of the underwriter s overallotment in January 2015.
In April 2016 the Company raised approximately $1,176,000 in net
proceeds upon the closing of a private placement of common stock.
In August 2016 the Company raised $1,300,000 in proceeds upon the
closing of another private placement of common stock. Since we
believe that the likelihood of obtaining traditional debt financing
at our stage of development is low, our source of funds in the
foreseeable future will likely be from the sale of capital stock or
some type of structured capital arrangement involving a combination
of debt with an equity component. 

-29- 

Cash Flows 

Cash activity for the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015 is
summarized as follows: 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has used
approximately $4,010,000 and $4,814,000 respectively, for operating
activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately
$914,000 of cash on hand. 

Funding Requirements 

While
the DenerveX product is in the final stages of development and
testing, we anticipate our cash expenditures will continue to
increase as we complete the Device Verification (DV) build and
testing of product for the DenerveX device and commencement of the
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in live tissue testing on our path
to submitting for CE mark and eventual FDA approval. Additionally,
we anticipate an increase in expenditures of cash to support both a
European clinical study to obtain additional clinical data to
support marketing goals and to pursue a strategy for an anticipated
U.S. clinical trial for eventual U.S. FDA clearance and to support
our launch for the product into the European Union. 

To the extent our available cash is insufficient to satisfy our
long-term operating requirements, we will need to seek additional
sources of funds from the sale of equity or debt securities or
through a credit facility, or we will need to modify our current
business plan. Th  ere
can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional
financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would
likely result in dilution to our current stockholders. 

Going Concern 

Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an
explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a
going concern in its report on our consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The
presence of the going concern explanatory paragraph suggests that
we may not have sufficient liquidity or minimum cash levels to
operate the business.   Since our inception, we have
incurred losses and anticipate that we will continue to incur
losses until such time as our products can generate enough revenue
to offset our research and development, general and administrative
and sales and marketing expenses. We received $1,398,034 and
$1,300,000, respectively, in gross proceeds in private placements
of common stock in April and August 2016. We also secured a short
term loan in September 2016 for $1,150,000, which contained an
original issuance discount of $150,000. From this short term loan,
we received net proceeds of $1,000,000. We believe these funds will
be sufficient to maintain uninterrupted operations while we pursue
our near term operational plans and other fund raising initiatives.
There can be no assurance we will be successful in our operational
plans. If the sale of Streamline takes longer than anticipated, or
we incur higher than anticipated expenses preparing for approval
and launch of our DenerveX product, we could need additional
funding later in 2016. There can be no assurances we will be
successful raising these funds. 

-30- 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in
Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4) during the periods presented,
investments in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings
or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative
contracts or synthetic leases. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

The
Company has a short term contractual obligation for the secured
nine month term loan for the principal amount of
$1,150,000. 

The
principal face value of the loan is $1,150,000 and was issued with
an original issuance discount of $150,000 which resulted in
aggregate proceeds of $1,000,000. The loan has a default interest
rate of 15% per year and a maturity date of June 16, 2017. The
Company is required to repay the principal amount of the loan
following the Company s receipt of any financing in aggregate
of $1,650,000 in the next six months. 

The Company has long term contractual obligations for the two
promissory notes issued  to the Bank of North Dakota New
Venture Capital Program and North Dakota Development Fund. Both of
the Bank of North Dakota New Venture Capital Program and North
Dakota Development Fund notes were assumed in conjunction with the
consummation of the Streamline acquisition on March 25,
2015 , and require combined monthly
payments of $5,661 into the third quarter of 2019. The Company has
a commercial building lease agreement with Sugar Oak Kimball Royal,
LLC for rent and utility costs for building space at a cost of
approximately $3,000 per month through July
2018.  

The
Company has a long term contractual commercial building lease
agreement with Sugar Oak Kimball Royal, LLC. The lease agreement
provides for the lease of office space through July 2018 at a cost
of approximately $2,800 per month. 

The Company does not have any other long term contractual
obligations. The Company currently reimburses its CEO, Jarrett
Gorlin, for the lease of executive office space at a cost of $2,000
per month, which it believes is at fair market value. We have
employment agreements with each of our executive officers that
commit us to a six month severance and benefits package if those
employees separate under certain conditions, including a change in
control of the Company. 

Changes in Board of Directors 

On
August 11, 2016 the Company received a resignation letter from Mr.
Thomas Hills from his position as a member of the Board of
Directors of the Company. There were no disagreements between Mr.
Hills and the Company. Mr. Hills wanted to make room for a new
director who could devote more time and energy to the
Company. 

On August 17, 2016, the Company appointed Ron Lawson to fill
Mr. Hills  vacancy and to serve as a member of the
Company s Board.  In connection with his
appointment, Mr. Lawson was granted 300,000 stock options under the
Company s 2013 Stock Option Incentive Plan.  Each
stock option has an exercise price of $1.20 and is exercisable
pursuant to the terms of the stock option award. 150,000 of
the options vest immediately and 150,000 vest in one
year. 

On October 18, 2016, the Company received a resignation letter from
Mr. John Blank from his position as a member of the board of
directors. There were no disagreements between Mr. Blank and the
Company. Mr. Blank stated that his resignation was to allow the
Company to appoint another individual that could contribute more to
the Company. 

On October 19, 2016, Jon Mogford, PH.D was appointed to fill the
vacancy created by Mr. Blank s resignation. Dr. Mogford was
designated as a nominee for director in the proxy statement for the
2016 annual meeting, which was approved by the Company s
stockholders at the 2016 annual meeting in November
2016.   

Notice of Delisting 

On August 30, 2016, we received a letter from the listing
qualifications department of the NASDAQ stock market notifying us
that the Company s stockholders  equity of $1,311,796
as reported in our quarterly report on form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 was below the minimum stockholders 
equity of $2,500,000 required for continued listing on the NASDAQ
capital market. The decline in the Company s
stockholders  equity was largely a result of the recognition
of an impairment loss recorded in our form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 related to the intangible assets of Streamline
Inc., the Company s wholly owned subsidiary acquired in March
2015. 

-31- 

On October 14, 2016, we submitted to NASDAQ a plan of compliance
letter outlining our plans to regain and sustain compliance with
the stockholders  equity requirement to sustain continued
listing on the NASDAQ capital market. 

On October 31, 2016, we received a response letter from the listing
qualifications department of the NASDAQ stock market indicating
they accepted the plan of compliance, and granted the Company an
extension to regain compliance.   Under the terms of the extension, the
Company must on or before February 27, 2017, complete a
stockholders' equity raising transaction, or other event, and
evidence compliance by furnishing to the SEC and NASDAQ in a
publicly available report detailing such actions to regain
compliance. In the event that we do not satisfy the terms set forth
in the extension, NASDAQ will provide written notification that the
Company s securities will be subject to delisting
proceedings. At that time, the Company may appeal NASDAQ s
determination to a listings qualification
panel.  

ITEM 3.      Q UANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 CFR
229.10(f)(1). Thus, under Item 305(a) of Regulation S-K, we are not
required to provide information under this item. 

ITEM 4.      C ONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Because
of its inherent limitations, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all material
misstatements arising from time to time. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. 

Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
( COSO ) in  Internal
Control-Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment,
management concluded that a material weakness existed in internal
control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls.
Specifically, our Chief Financial Officer currently performs almost
all of the accounting related functions. In order to obtain proper
segregation of accounting related duties, another person will have
to be hired and duties allocated so this material weakness can be
corrected.    

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.         L EGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We are not a party to any pending legal proceeding, nor is our
property the subject of a pending legal proceeding. None of our
directors, officers or affiliates are involved in a proceeding
adverse to our business or has a material interest adverse to our
business. 

ITEM 1A.      R ISK

CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER     

PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a)
UNDER     

THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

I,
Jarrett Gorlin, certify that: 

1. 

I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, of MedoveX Corp.; 

2.  

Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report; 

3.  

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, fairly present in
all material respects the financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the
periods presented in this rport; 

4.  

The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are
responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
registrant and have: 

(a) 

Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
period in which this report is being prepared; 

(b) 

Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles; 

(c) 

Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report our
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report
based on such evaluation; and 

(d) 

Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the
