CHEMTURA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1)                               NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Nature of Operations 
  Chemtura Corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, is a global specialty chemical company dedicated to delivering innovative, performance-driven engineered specialty chemical solutions which are used as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to our customers' end products.  We are committed to global sustainability through  greener technology  and developing engineered chemical solutions that meet our customers  evolving needs.  We operate in a wide variety of end-use industries, including automotive, building and construction, electronics, energy, lubricants, packaging and transportation.  We are a leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in more than   80   countries.  
  Our principal executive offices are located in Philadelphia, PA and Middlebury, CT. 
  When we use the terms  Corporation,   Company,   Chemtura,   Registrant,   We,   Us  and  Our,  unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Chemtura Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries. 
  The information in the foregoing Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarters and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is unaudited but reflects all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise disclosed in the accompanying notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Chemtura and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries that we control.  Other affiliates in which we have a   20%   to   50%   ownership interest or a non-controlling majority interest are accounted for in accordance with the equity method.  Other investments in which we have less than   20%   ownership are recorded at cost.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  The interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Form 10-K ).  The consolidated results of operations for the quarter and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. 
  In accordance with the requirements of ASC 740,   Income Taxes  , we calculate our interim period income tax expense based upon an estimated effective tax rate for the annual period multiplied by our interim earnings (loss) before income taxes, adjusted for discrete items as necessary. 
  Accounting Policies and Other Items 
  Included in accounts receivable are allowances for doubtful accounts of   $4 million   and   $2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made cash interest payments of   $29 million   and   $30 million  , respectively, and cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) of   $22 million   and   $32 million  , respectively.  
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $2 million   of our asset retirement obligation balance was included in accrued expenses and   $15 million   was included in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  At December 31, 2015,   $1 million   of asset retirement obligation balance was included in accrued expense and   $15 million   was included in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Accounting Developments 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new standard is effective on January 1, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted in 2017 for calendar year entities.  We currently do not intend to early adopt.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  We are in the process of assessing our current practices against the requirements of this ASU and evaluating the effect that the ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.  We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    Under current U.S. GAAP, debt issuance costs are reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense.  This ASU requires that they be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation of debt discounts or premiums.  The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.  We adopted this guidance retrospectively during the first quarter of 2016.  As a result of adoption of this guidance, total assets and total liabilities as of December 31, 2015 decreased as discussed below: 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,   which requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  This new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied prospectively.  While early adoption is permitted we do not intend to early adopt these provisions.  The adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  , which revises the accounting related to lessee accounting.  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases with terms greater than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations.  The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact this accounting standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, employee tax withholding, calculation of shares for use in diluted earnings per share and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The provisions of ASU 2016-09 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  We have evaluated the impact of this standard based on the information available to us as of September 30, 2016 and have determined that it would not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or related disclosures.  We intend to adopt this new ASU on January 1, 2017. 

2)                        MERGERS AND DIVESTITURES 
  Pending merger transaction with Lanxess 
  On   September 25, 2016  , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Lanxess Deutschland GmbH, a limited liability company under the laws of Germany ("Lanxess"), and LANXESS Additives Inc., a Delaware  
  
   7 

corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess ("Merger Subsidiary").  Upon the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Chemtura (the "Merger"), with Chemtura surviving the merger in an all-cash transaction in which Chemtura stockholders will receive   $33.50   in cash, without interest, per share of Chemtura common stock, which represented an   18.9%   premium to the stock s closing share price of   $28.18   on   September 23, 2016  , the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger.  Chemtura and Lanxess have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement.  The Merger Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions including, among others, approval of the Merger Agreement by Chemtura stockholders, regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, assets, liabilities or results of operations.  Closing is not subject to any vote of Lanxess s stockholders or any financing condition. 
  The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Chemtura and Lanxess and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if we terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal, we may be required to pay Lanxess a termination fee equal to   $75 million   as a condition to our ability to exercise our right to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept the superior proposal. 
  We expect to file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC regarding the Merger.  The description of the Merger Agreement and the Merger herein does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 26, 2016. 
  Contemporaneous with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into an agreement with SK Blue Holdings, Ltd., and Addivant USA Holdings Corp (collectively, "Addivant") that committed us to surrender our shares of Addivant preferred stock to Addivant along with a cash payment of   $1 million   in exchange for a modification of a non-compete agreement entered into in conjunction with the sale of our antioxidants business to Addivant in 2013.  Reflecting the terms of this agreement, in the third quarter of 2016, we took a charge of   $5 million   which is included in merger and integration costs described below.  The agreement with Addivant also provides for certain other changes to our continuing supply agreements with Addivant contingent upon the completion of the Merger. 
  During the   third   quarter of 2016, we recorded   $11 million   of merger and integration costs, which primarily are comprised of the legal and other fees associated with the signing of the Merger Agreement and the terms of the agreement with Addivant. 
  Chemtura AgroSolutions business divestiture 
  In   November 2014  , we sold our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation ("Platform") under a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement ("SAPA") for approximately   $1 billion  , consisting of   $950 million   in cash and   2 million   shares of Platform's common stock.  During 2015, we sold the   2 million   shares of Platform common stock for net proceeds of   $54 million  .  The purchase price was subject to customary post-closing adjustments, primarily for working capital which was settled during 2015. 
  Under the terms of the SAPA, we retained most of the property, plant and equipment used to manufacture products of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business and continue to manufacture products for Platform under several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the "supply agreements") with minimum terms of between   two   and   four   years.  In alignment with the change in the nature of operations, we changed the name of this segment to Agrochemical Manufacturing. 
  The supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements.  Accordingly, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included   $155 million  , which represents the remaining loss of profit, on a discounted basis, for these products over the remaining terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue to supply for a period of up to   2 years   after termination of the supply agreements. 
  The recognition of this obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value, has been and will continue to be recorded as net sales in the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement based on our estimate of the timing of shipments.  The recognition of this obligation will not generate cash flows during the term of the supply agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the current and long-term portions of this obligation, on a discounted basis, were   $38 million   and   $117 million  , respectively.  
  As of December 31, 2014, we had not transferred ownership of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia and our   15%   investment in Certis Europe B.V. ("Certis") to Platform as provided in the SAPA due to certain pending approvals.  The value ascribed to these investments as part of the purchase price was received at the closing in   November 2014  .  We closed on the sale of our subsidiary in Russia in   January 2015   and we transferred our shares in Certis to Platform during the second quarter of 2015. 
  
   8 

Included in the loss on sale of business for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   are customary working capital and other adjustments and the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia. 
   
  3)                               RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES 
  We recorded a pre-tax charge of   $1 million   during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 primarily for professional fees related to the closure of the West Lafayette, Indiana facility that was initiated in February 2015. 
    
  A summary of the changes in the liabilities established for restructuring programs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance of these reserves were included in accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

4)                               INVENTORIES 

Included in the above net inventory balances are inventory obsolescence reserves of approximately   $12 million   and   $20 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

5)                               PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 

Depreciation expense was   $19 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and $  58 million   and $  61 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Depreciation expense included accelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets associated with our restructuring programs of   $2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

6)                               GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  Goodwill was   $162 million   and   $166 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The decrease in goodwill since   December 31, 2015   was due to foreign currency translation.  The goodwill is allocated to the Industrial Performance Products segment.  
  
   9 

Our intangible assets, excluding goodwill, consist of Patents, Trademarks, Customer Relationships and Other Intangibles.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our net intangible assets were   $81 million   and   $88 million  , respectively.  The decrease was primarily due to amortization expense.  Amortization expense related to intangible assets was   $2 million   and   $3 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $6 million   and   $9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

7)                               DEBT 
  Our debt is comprised of the following: 

Financing Facilities 
  2021 Senior Notes 
  In July 2013, we completed a registered public offering of   $450 million   of   5.75%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes").  
  We are permitted to redeem some or all of the 2021 Senior Notes, with the redemption prices being, prior to July 15, 2017,   104.313%   of the principal amount; on or after July 15, 2017 and prior to July 15, 2018,   102.875%   of the principal amount; on or after July 15, 2018 and prior to July 15, 2019,   101.438%   of the principal amount; and thereafter   100%   of the principal amount, in each case plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  If we experience certain kinds of changes in control, as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes (the "2021 Indenture"), we may be required to offer to repurchase all of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price (subject to limitations as described in the 2021 Indenture) equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
  Our 2021 Senior Notes contain covenants that limit our ability to enter into certain transactions, such as incurring secured debt and subsidiary debt and entering into sale and lease-back transactions. 
  Our 2021 Senior Notes are subject to certain events of default, including, among others, breach of other agreements in the 2021 Indenture; any guarantee of a significant subsidiary ceasing to be in full force and effect; a default by us or our restricted subsidiaries under any bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of a certain amount, resulting in its acceleration; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. 
  Term Loan 
  In August 2010, we entered into a senior secured term loan facility due August 2016 (the "Term Loan") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto for an aggregate principal amount of   $295 million   with an original issue discount of   1%  .  Repayments were made on the Term Loan in 2013 and 2014 with proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes offering, the cash proceeds from the sale of businesses and cash on hand.  In May 2015, we made an additional repayment of   $42 million  .  In June 2016, we made a payment of   $39 million   on the Term Loan leaving   $1 million   remaining outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i)   1.75%   plus the   Base Rate   (defined as the higher of (a) the   Federal Funds   rate plus   0.5%  ; (b) Bank of America s published   prime rate  ; and (c) the   Eurodollar Rate   plus   1%  ) or (ii)   2.75%   plus the   Eurodollar Rate   (defined as the higher of (a)   0.75%   and (b) the current   LIBOR   adjusted for reserve requirements). 
  
   10 

The Term Loan contains covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to enter into certain transactions, such as creating liens, incurring additional indebtedness or repaying certain indebtedness, making investments, paying dividends, and entering into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. 
  Additionally, the Term Loan requires that we meet certain financial maintenance covenants including a maximum Secured Leverage Ratio (net of unrestricted cash, as defined in the agreement) of   2.5  :1.0 and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the agreement) of   3.0  :1.0.  Additionally, the Term Loan contains a covenant related to the repayment of excess cash flow (as defined in the agreement).  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Term Loan. 
  In July 2016, we amended our Term Loan providing for a new   $1 million   term loan which was borrowed to refinance the remaining balance of the Term Loan.  The interest rate for the new term loan is identical to and maintains substantially identical collateral, covenants, events of default, representations and warranties and other terms as the original Term Loan, but with an extended maturity date to July 2017, a waiver of the prepayment requirements for proceeds of asset sales and annual excess cash flow, and a reduction of the annual administrative agency fee. 
  ABL Facility 
  In December 2013, we entered into a   five  -year senior secured revolving credit facility that provides for   $175 million   available to our domestic subsidiaries (the "US ABL Facility") and    60 million   available to Chemtura Sales Europe B.V., a Netherlands subsidiary (the  Foreign ABL Facility , and together with the US ABL Facility, the  2018 ABL Facility ), subject in each case to availability under a borrowing base.  The 2018 ABL Facility provides a   $125 million   letter of credit sub-facility. 
  The revolving loans under the 2018 ABL Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum which, at our option, can be either: (a) a base rate (which varies depending on the currency in which the loans are borrowed) plus a margin of between   0.50%   and   1.00%   for loans denominated in U.S. dollars or between   1.50%   and   2.00%   for loans denominated in other currencies, in each case based on the average excess availability under the 2018 ABL Facility for the preceding quarter; or (b) the current reserve adjusted Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the agreement) plus a margin of between   1.50%   and   2.00%   based on the average excess availability under the 2018 ABL Facility for the preceding quarter. 
  The 2018 ABL Facility Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants (applicable to us, the other borrowing subsidiaries, the guarantors and their respective subsidiaries other than unrestricted subsidiaries), including, without limitation, covenants requiring financial reporting and notices of certain events, and covenants imposing limitations on incurrence of indebtedness and guaranties; liens; loans and investments; asset dispositions; dividends, redemptions, and repurchases of stock and prepayments, redemptions and repurchases of certain indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, joint ventures or creation of subsidiaries; material changes in business; transactions with affiliates; restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries and granting of negative pledges; changes in accounting and reporting; sale leasebacks; and speculative transactions, and a springing financial covenant requiring a minimum trailing four quarter fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.0   to   1.0   at all times during (A) any period from the date when the amount available for borrowings under the 2018 ABL Facility falls below the greater of (i)   $25 million   and (ii)   10%   of the aggregate commitments to the date such available amount has been equal to or greater than the greater of (i)   $25 million   and (ii)   10%   of the aggregate commitments for   30   consecutive days, or (B) any period from the date when the amount available for borrowings under the US ABL Facility falls below the greater of (i)   $18 million   and (ii)   10%   of the aggregate commitments under the US ABL Facility to the date such available amount has been equal to or greater than the greater of (i)   $18 million   and (ii)   10%   of the aggregate commitments under the US ABL Facility for   30   consecutive days. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   borrowings under the 2018 ABL Facility.  However, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   we had   $12 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, of outstanding letters of credit (primarily related to insurance and environmental obligations and banking credit facilities) which utilizes available capacity under the facility.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $164 million   and   $186 million  , respectively, of undrawn availability under the 2018 ABL Facility. 
  Other Facilities 
  In December 2012, we entered into a CNY   250 million   (approximately   $40 million  )   5   year secured credit facility available through December 2017 (the  China Bank Facility ) with Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch (the "ABC Bank").  The China Bank Facility has been used for funding construction of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, China and is secured by land, property and machinery of our subsidiary Chemtura Advanced Materials (Nantong) Co., Ltd.  The loans under the China Bank Facility bear interest at a rate determined from time to time by ABC Bank based on the prevailing People's Bank of  
  
   11 

China Lending Rate.  Repayments of principal are made in semi-annual installments from December 2014 through December 2017.  In January 2015, we prepaid   $15 million   of the China Bank Facility with proceeds from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had borrowings of   $11 million   under the China Bank Facility.  
    
  We have an uncommitted revolving facility with Bank of America, N.A., Shanghai Branch for supporting the general working capital requirements of our Chinese entities.  The facility currently provides for borrowings of up to   $10 million  .  The loans under the facility bear interest at a rate determined from time to time by the bank based on the prevailing People's Bank of China Lending Rate.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had borrowings of   $7 million   and   $1 million   under the facility, respectively. 

8)                               INCOME TAXES 
  We reported income tax expense of   $17 million   and   $16 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We reported income tax expense of   $15 million   and   $43 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively.  The tax expense reported for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflected tax expense of   $3 million  , recorded in the third quarter of 2016, for an increase to the valuation allowance related to our state net operating loss deferred tax asset and a tax benefit of   $33 million  , recorded in the first quarter of 2016, related to the pension annuity transaction which was considered a discrete item for purposes of our interim tax provision.   
  We have net liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of   $28 million   and   $27 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will remain unchanged within the next 12 months. 
   
  9)                               ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
  The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss ( AOCL ), net of tax at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows:  

The following table summarizes the reclassifications from AOCL to the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the quarters and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  10)                               COMMON SHARES 
  The computation of basic earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  The computation of diluted earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per common share equals the basic earnings per common share for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , since the common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive as a result of a loss from continuing operations.  Common stock equivalents amounted to   0.8 million   shares for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of earnings per share:  

In   October 2014  , our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a share repurchase authorization of up to   $500 million   conditioned upon the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business (the  October 2014 Authorization ).  In   August 2015  , the Board authorized an increase to the October 2014 Authorization by   $150 million  , up to   $650 million   in the aggregate when combined with the October 2014 Authorization, and extended the program to December 1, 2016.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   4.5 million   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $116 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $54 million   remained under our share repurchase program. 
  The shares are expected to be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases.  The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Board s discretion.  The manner, price, number and timing of such repurchases, if any, will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  We release the value of treasury shares at the weighted average price per share when shares are issued from treasury. 
  
   13 

We do not currently anticipate undertaking further repurchases in light of our Merger Agreement with Lanxess. 

11)                        STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS 
  In 2010, we adopted the Chemtura Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2010 LTIP ).  The 2010 LTIP provides for grants of non-qualified stock options ( NQOs ), incentive stock options ( ISOs ), stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, stock units, bonus stock, performance awards, share awards, restricted stock, time-based restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and performance-based RSUs.  The 2010 LTIP provides for the issuance of a maximum of   11 million   shares.  Stock options may be granted under the 2010 LTIP at prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common shares on the date of the grant.  All outstanding stock options will expire not more than   ten years   from the date of the grant.  Stock issuances can be from treasury shares or newly issued shares. 
  Share-based compensation expense was   $3 million   for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and $  9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Stock-based compensation expense was primarily reported in SG A. 
  Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares 
  In   March 2016  , the compensation and governance committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") approved the grant of   0.2 million   time-based RSUs under the   2016   long-term incentive awards (the "  2016   Awards").  These RSUs vest ratably over a   three  -year period. 
  In   March 2016  , the Compensation Committee also approved the grant of   0.2 million   performance shares under the   2016   Awards.  The performance share grant is subject to a performance multiplier of up to   2   times the targeted award.  The performance measurement period is the   three   calendar year period ending   December 31, 2018   and the performance share metric is the relative total shareholder return against the companies comprising the Dow Jones U.S. Chemical Index.  The performance shares will be settled as soon as practicable after the performance period but no later than   March 15, 2019  .  We used the Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the performance shares.  Using this method, the average per share fair value of these awards was   $28.89  . 
  Total remaining unrecognized compensation expense associated with all unvested time-based RSUs and performance shares at   September 30, 2016   was   $13 million  , which will be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately   2   years. 
    
  Contingent upon the closing of the Merger, all remaining RSUs and performance shares outstanding at that time will be converted into cash awards and will continue to vest according to our current long-term incentive award plans. 

12)                        PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
  Components of our defined benefit plans net periodic benefit (credit) cost for the quarters and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:  

14 

On February 22, 2016, we announced that, in accordance with the selection made by Evercore Trust Company, N.A. ("Evercore Trust"), the independent fiduciary for the Chemtura Corporation Retirement Plan (the  US Qualified Plan ), our US Qualified Plan entered into a purchase agreement with Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company ("Voya"), a member of the Voya Financial, Inc. family of companies, for a group annuity contract transferring payment responsibility to Voya for the pension benefits of approximately   5,000   U.S. retirees, or their designated beneficiaries, to Voya. 
    
  By irrevocably transferring these pension benefit payment obligations to Voya, our overall projected pension benefit obligation has been reduced by   $363 million  , based on the valuation date of February 17, 2016.  The annuity purchase price was   $354 million   and was funded by the assets of the US Qualified Plan.  As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charge of   $162 million   to pension settlement in the first quarter of 2016.  Additionally, we contributed   $35 million   of cash to the US Qualified Plan during the first quarter of 2016 to maintain the US Qualified Plan s funded status at the approximate level that existed prior to the pension annuity transaction. 
    
  We also completed the evaluation as to whether additional benefit obligations existed in connection with the equalization of certain benefits under the Great Lakes U.K. Limited Pension Plan ("UK Pension Plan") that occurred in the early 1990s and pursuant to European Law requiring equal treatment of male and female members.      During the first quarter of 2016, we reached a final agreement with the trustees of the UK Pension Plan as to the contribution our UK subsidiary should make to fund this benefit obligation and as a result we further reduced our previously estimated liability related to this matter.  Therefore, in the first quarter of 2016, our UK subsidiary made a contribution of under   $1 million   to the UK Pension Plan in accordance with the agreement reached with the trustees and released the   $2 million   remainder of the estimated liability as a credit to SG A. 
    
  As noted above, we contributed a total of   $35 million   to our US qualified pension plans in the first quarter of 2016.  We also contributed   $2 million   to our US non-qualified pension plans and   $15 million   to our international pension plans in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Contributions to post-retirement health care plans in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $5 million  . 
    
  We participate in a multi-employer pension plan that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement.  The projected liabilities of this plan based on the April 1, 2016 actuarial projection were   $13 million   and the market value of the assets were   $10 million   at March 31, 2016, an estimated   79.9%   funded status.  In May 2016, this plan was certified by its plan actuary as critical and declining.  We intend to review the rehabilitation plan with the plan trustees to mitigate the risk of insolvency of this plan to the extent possible. 
    
  Our contributions to this multi-employer plan for 2016 and prior years have been and are expected to continue to be insignificant.  However, due to the withdrawal of certain employers from the plan and the critical and declining status, there is uncertainty regarding the impact on our future contributions, although any incremental future contributions are not expected to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 

13)                        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  We are involved in claims, litigation, administrative proceedings and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions.  A number of such matters involve, or may involve, claims for a material amount of damages and relate to or allege, among other things, environmental liabilities, including clean-up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites, natural resource damages, property damage and personal injury.  
  Litigation and Claims  
  
   15 

Environmental Liabilities 
  We are involved in environmental matters of various types in a number of jurisdictions.  These matters may, from time to time, involve claims for material amounts of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities, including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites and natural resource damages. 
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ( CERCLA ), and comparable state statutes impose strict liability upon various classes of persons with respect to the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of waste disposal sites.  Such persons are typically referred to as  Potentially Responsible Parties  or PRPs.  Because in certain circumstances these laws have been construed to authorize the imposition of joint and several liability, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and comparable state agencies could seek to recover all costs involving a waste disposal site from any one of the PRPs for such site, including Chemtura, despite the involvement of other PRPs.  Currently, we are one of a large number of PRPs with respect to a site in which we hold the majority of the liability.  Chemtura and its subsidiaries may be named as PRPs at other sites in the future.  In addition, we are involved with environmental remediation and compliance activities at some of our current and former sites in the United States and abroad. 
  Each quarter, we evaluate and review estimates for future remediation and other costs to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts.  For each site where the cost of remediation is probable and reasonably estimable, we determine the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site, the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan, the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by us and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur.  At sites where we expect to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures, we accrue on an undiscounted basis for a period of generally   10 years   those costs which we believe are probable and estimable. 
  The total amount accrued for environmental liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $63 million  .  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $16 million   of these environmental liabilities were reflected as accrued expenses and   $47 million   were reflected as other liabilities.  We estimate that ongoing environmental liabilities could range up to   $71 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Our accruals for environmental liabilities include estimates for determinable clean-up costs.  We recorded pre-tax charges of   $5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and made payments of   $7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for clean-up costs, which reduced our environmental liabilities.  At certain sites, we have contractual agreements with certain other parties to share remediation costs.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   receivables are outstanding related to these agreements.  At a number of these sites, the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable.  We intend to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters.  However, the final cost of clean-up at these sites could exceed our present estimates, and could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Our estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future as the extent of contamination is further investigated, should additional sites be identified, further remediation measures be required or undertaken, current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted, and as negotiations with respect to certain sites are finalized. 
  Other 
  We are routinely subject to civil claims, litigations, arbitrations, and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of our business, as well as in respect of our divested businesses.  Some of these claims and litigations relate to product liability claims, including claims related to our current and historical products of our corporate affiliates and predecessors. 
  Guarantees 
  In addition to the letters of credit of   $12 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have guarantees that have been provided to various financial institutions.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $6 million   of outstanding guarantees, respectively.  The letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to liabilities for insurance and environmental obligations, banking and credit facilities, vendor deposits and European value added tax ( VAT ) obligations. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on our behalf or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation, claims or environmental matters relating to our past performance.  For any losses that we believe are probable and estimable, we have accrued for such amounts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

14)                        BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA 
  We evaluate a segment s performance based on several factors, of which the primary factor is operating income (loss).  In computing operating income (loss) by segment, the following items have not been deducted:  (1) general corporate expense; (2) amortization; (3) facility closures, severance and related costs; (4) merger and integration costs; (5) gain or loss on sale of business; (6) impairment charges; and (7) pension settlement charge.  Pursuant to ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting   ( ASC 280 ), these items have been excluded from our reporting segment presentation of operating income (loss) because they are not reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources among reporting segments or assessing segment performance. 
  Industrial Performance Products 
  Industrial Performance Products are engineered solutions for our customers  specialty chemical needs.  Industrial Performance Products include petroleum additives that provide detergency, friction modification and corrosion protection in automotive lubricants, greases, refrigeration and turbine lubricants as well as synthetic lubricant base-stocks and greases; castable urethane prepolymers engineered to provide superior abrasion resistance and durability in many industrial and recreational applications; and polyurethane dispersions and urethane prepolymers used in various types of coatings such as clear floor finishes, high-gloss paints and textiles treatments.  These products are sold directly to manufacturers and through distribution channels. 
  Industrial Engineered Products 
  Industrial Engineered Products are chemical additives designed to improve the performance of polymers in their end-use applications.  Industrial Engineered Products include brominated performance products, flame retardants, fumigants and organometallics.  The products are sold across the entire value chain ranging from direct sales to monomer producers, polymer manufacturers, compounders and fabricators, manufacturers of electronic components, fine chemical manufacturers, utilities, pharmaceutical manufactures and oilfield service companies to industry distributors. 
  Agrochemical Manufacturing 
  Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment represents continuing supply agreements with Platform with minimum terms of between   two   and   four   years.  The supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements.  Due to these economics, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term and therefore, an obligation was recorded, on a discounted basis, which represents the remaining loss of profit on these products over the remaining terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue to supply for a period of up to   2 years   after the termination of the contracts.  The recognition of this obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value, has been and will continue to be recorded as net sales in the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement based on our estimate of the timing of shipments.  The recognition of this obligation will not generate cash flows during the term of the supply agreements.  
  Corporate and Other Charges 
  Corporate includes costs and expenses that are of a general corporate nature or managed on a corporate basis.  These costs (net of allocations to the business segments) primarily represent corporate stewardship and administration activities together with costs associated with legacy activities and intangible asset amortization.  Functional costs are allocated between the business segments and general corporate expense.  Facility closures, severance and related costs are primarily for severance costs related to our cost savings initiatives.  Merger and integration costs primarily are comprised of legal and other fees associated with the signing of the Merger Agreement with Lanxess and the charge related to the modification of the non-compete agreement with Addivant.  The loss on sale of business primarily represents the settlement of working capital and other adjustments which occurred in 2015 related to the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business in 2014.  The pension settlement related to the transfer of certain pension benefit obligations to Voya which occurred in the first quarter of 2016.

ITEM 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
   
  PENDING MERGER TRANSACTION WITH LANXESS 
  On   September 25, 2016  , we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Lanxess Deutschland GmbH, a limited liability company under the laws of Germany ("Lanxess"), and LANXESS Additives Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Lanxess ("Merger Subsidiary").  Upon the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Chemtura (the "Merger"), with Chemtura surviving the merger in an all-cash transaction in which Chemtura stockholders will receive   $33.50   in cash, without interest, per share of Chemtura common stock, which represented an   18.9%   premium to the stock s closing share price of   $28.18   on   September 23, 2016  , the last trading day prior to the announcement of the Merger. 
  The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions.  Assuming timely satisfaction of the necessary closing conditions, we currently expect the Merger to close in mid-2017. 
  Contemporaneous with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into an agreement with SK Blue Holdings, Ltd., and Addivant USA Holdings Corp (collectively, "Addivant") that committed us to surrender our shares of Addivant preferred stock to Addivant along with a cash payment of   $1 million   in exchange for a modification of a non-compete agreement entered into in conjunction with the sale of our antioxidants business to Addivant in 2013.  Reflecting the terms of this agreement, in the third quarter of 2016, we took a charge of   $5 million   which is included in merger and integration costs described below.  The agreement with Addivant also provides for certain other changes to our continuing supply agreements with Addivant contingent upon the completion of the Merger. 
  For further discussion of the Merger, see Note 2   Merger and Divestitures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

OUR BUSINESS 
  We are a global, publicly traded specialty chemical company dedicated to delivering innovative, performance-driven engineered specialty chemical solutions which are used as additives, ingredients or intermediates that add value to our customers' end products.  We are committed to global sustainability through  greener technology  and developing engineered chemical solutions that meet our customers  evolving needs.  We operate in a wide variety of end-use industries, including automotive, building and construction, electronics, energy, lubricants, packaging and transportation. We are a leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in more than 80 countries.  Our principal executive offices are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Middlebury, Connecticut.  
  The primary economic factors that influence the operations and net sales of our Industrial Performance Products ( Industrial Performance ) and Industrial Engineered Products ( Industrial Engineered ) segments (collectively referred to as  Industrials ) are demand conditions in industrial, electronics, energy, residential and commercial construction, and transportation markets.  Other factors affecting our financial performance include industry capacity, customer demand, raw material and energy costs, and sales prices.  Sales prices are heavily influenced by the global demand and supply for the products we produce and competitor behavior.  We pursue sales prices that reflect the value of our products delivered to our customers, while seeking to pass on higher costs for raw material and energy to preserve our profit margins. 
  Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment represents ongoing supply agreements with Platform Specialty Products Corporation ("Platform") which were entered into in November 2014 contemporaneously with the sale of our former Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform.  The supply agreements with Platform are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements. 
   
     THIRD   QUARTER RESULTS 
  Overview 
  Consolidated net sales for the   third   quarter of 2016 were   $414 million   or $30 million lower than the   third   quarter of 2015 due to lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix of   $24 million   and lower selling prices of   $7 million  , partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation of   $1 million  .  Volume improvements in our Industrial Engineered segment, which were primarily driven by improvements in our polymerization co-catalysts and tin specialty compounds, Emerald Innovation 3000   TM    and the return of bromine sales to normalized levels in 2016 after the strike at a supplier in 2015, were partly offset by volume declines related to weak demand for clear brine fluids used in offshore deep oil well drilling applications and the timing of sales under certain supply agreements.  However, in our Industrial Performance segment, volume was the same as the comparable period in 2015 as declines in certain product lines were completely offset by improvements in others.  Demand for certain synthetic lubricants, basestock products, intermediates and urethane products used in mining and gas applications were lower but offset by a temporary increase in inhibitors volume as one of our Asian competitor's plants was shutdown in the third quarter of 2016 and we were able to fill the market demand.  Sales price declines were primarily driven by our Industrial Performance segment where we continued to pass along the benefit of lower raw material costs to our customers under formula-based pricing arrangements coupled with lower prices for our urethane products used in the mining and gas industries due to the weak market demand.  Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment reported lower net sales which is entirely due to the migration from a supply agreement to a tolling agreement in Brazil.  While there is no impact on gross profit, the change resulted in a reduction in both net sales and cost of sales as we no longer purchase or sell the raw material component of the products as part of the tolling arrangement. 
  
   27 

Gross profit for the   third   quarter of 2016 was   $125 million  , an increase of   $8 million   compared with the   third   quarter of 2015.  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to   30%   for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with   26%   for the   third   quarter of 2015.  The increase in gross profit was primarily due to lower costs for raw materials offset in part by lower sales prices discussed above.  Gross profit also benefited from favorable manufacturing variances associated with increased production for certain products in our Industrial Engineered segment. 
  Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses of   $35 million   were $1 million lower than the   third   quarter of 2015 primarily the result of a gain of $2 million related to the sale of a non-operating site offset by higher charges related to employee incentive accruals. 
  Merger and integration costs reported for the   third   quarter of 2016 were   $11 million   which primarily are comprised of legal and other fees associated with the signing of the Merger Agreement with Lanxess.  Additionally, included in these costs is a charge related to the commitment to surrender our Addivant preferred shares along with a cash payment of $1 million related to a modification of a non-compete agreement entered into in conjunction with the sale of our antioxidants business to Addivant in 2013, which was modified contemporaneously with the signing of our agreement with Lanxess. 
  Other Non-Operating Income and Expense 
  Interest expense of   $8 million   during the   third   quarter of 2016 was slightly higher than the   third   quarter of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to higher capitalized interest during the   third   quarter of 2015 related to capital projects. 
  Other expense, net was   $1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with other income, net of   $1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  Other (expense) income, net primarily reflected realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses. 
  Income tax expense reported for the   third   quarter of 2016 was   $17 million   compared with   $16 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015. 
  Net earnings for the   third   quarter of 2016 were   $25 million  , or   $0.39   per diluted share, as compared with   $31 million  , or   $0.45   per diluted share, for the   third   quarter of 2015. 
  The following tables describe the major factors impacting net sales and operating income for each of our segments: 

(a) 
    "Price over raw materials" is the sum of the net changes in selling prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods.  As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in  
     
   28 

reductions in selling prices under certain agreements, the change in selling prices net of changes in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of selling price changes on our profitability. 
           (b) 
    Includes facility closures, severance and related costs, merger and integration costs and loss on sale of business. 
       
  The following is a discussion of the operating results of our segments for the   third   quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Industrial Performance Products 
  Our Industrial Performance segment reported lower net sales and higher operating income for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with the same quarter of 2015. 
  Net sales for the third quarter of 2016 reflected a reduction in both volume and sales prices.  Both our petroleum additive and urethane products were impacted by the lower volumes.  Our petroleum additive products experienced a weaker demand for certain synthetic lubricants and base stock products as well as other intermediate products which was partially offset by higher volume for our inhibitor and detergent products.  Our inhibitor and intermediate products benefited from the market tightness which was associated with the temporary shutdown of one of our Asian competitor s plants.  Volume for our urethane products, primarily those used in mining and oil and gas applications, were impacted by lower market demand as a result of the fall in oil prices, slower economic growth and lower commodity prices.  Sales prices continued to decline from the comparative quarter as we passed along the benefit of raw material cost reductions to our customers, including as required under formula-based contract pricing agreements.  
  Operating income reflected favorable product mix despite the lower volume, favorable price-over-raws and lower distribution expense partially offset with higher SG A expense and unfavorable manufacturing variances.  Additionally, the third quarter of 2016 reflected lower charges associated with inventory adjustments than in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Industrial Engineered Products 
  Our Industrial Engineered segment recorded higher net sales and operating income for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with the same quarter of 2015. 
  Our Industrial Engineered segment reported higher net sales as a result of an overall improvement in volume and product mix and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation.  Volume improvements in our organometallic products reflected the benefit of the growth in our customer base and our bromine and bromine-based products' volume returned to normalized levels.  In 2015, our ability to obtain bromine was restricted due to a strike at one of our suppliers resulting in the lower sales volumes in that period.  The impact of these volume gains was minimized by the decline in demand for clear brine fluids used in offshore deep oil well drilling applications we have seen in 2016 as a result of global macro conditions related to oil as well as the timing of sales of industrial water treatment products under certain supply agreements.  Overall sales prices remained flat as some modest increase in our tin specialty products and our Emerald Innovation 3000   TM    was offset by slightly weaker pricing in products used in electric and electronic applications as well as for clear brine fluid products. 
  Operating income reflected the benefit of net favorable sales prices over the cost of raw materials and favorable manufacturing variances driven by strong production of our Emerald Innovation 3000   TM    and organometallic products coupled with lower SG A which is the result of cost reduction actions we took in 2015.  These benefits were reduced by a charge of $2 million in the third quarter of 2016 related to the return of certain inventory. 
    
  Agrochemical Manufacturing 
  The Agrochemical Manufacturing segment reported lower net sales while operating income was flat compared with the   third   quarter of 2015. 
  The decrease in net sales was attributable to a change from a supply agreement to a tolling agreement in Brazil which began in the second quarter of 2016.  The change to a tolling agreement does not impact our gross margin, as the agreement continues to only reimburse costs incurred.  However, subsequent to the change we no longer purchase or sell the raw material component of the products produced which has impacted net sales and cost of sales by similar amounts.  The results for the   third   quarters of 2016 and 2015 included $10 million in net sales and operating profit related to the non-cash amortization, net of accretion, of a below-market contract obligation that was recorded as part of the Chemtura AgroSolutions divestiture in 2014. 
  Corporate 
    
  Corporate costs include those costs that are of a general nature or managed on a corporate basis.  These costs, net of allocations to the business segments, primarily represent corporate stewardship and administration activities together with costs associated  
  
   29 

with legacy activities and intangible asset amortization.  Functional costs are allocated between the business segments and general corporate expense. 
  Corporate expense was   $14 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016, which included amortization and depreciation expense of   $2 million  .  In comparison, corporate expense was   $15 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015, which included amortization and depreciation expense of   $3 million  .  T  he decrease is primarily related to a reduction in amortization expense, a $2 million gain on the sale of a non-operating site offset by increased charges for employee incentive plan and environmental accruals and legal expenses. 
   
  YEAR TO DATE RESULTS 
  Overview 
  Consolidated net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,269 million   or $77 million lower than the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   due to lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix of   $57 million   and lower selling prices of   $20 million  .  The decrease in sales prices was in our Industrial Performance segment where we lowered sales prices for our petroleum additive products as we passed along the benefit of raw material cost reductions to our customers as required under formula-based contract pricing agreements coupled with reduced prices for urethane products used in mining and gas applications due to weak market conditions.  Our Industrial Engineered segment partly offset those declines by improved pricing for our Emerald Innovation 3000   TM    products and other products used in electric and electronic applications.  Unfavorable volume impacted all our segments.  Industrial Performance continued to report lower volumes for urethane products used in the mining and gas applications as a result of the weak market conditions and petroleum additive products reported overall growth in volumes for our additive and intermediate products but those gains were offset by a combination of lower volume and unfavorable mix for certain synthetic lubricants and base stocks.  Our Industrial Engineered segment reflected the impact of lower volume of clear brine fluids used in offshore deep oil well drilling coupled with lower volumes related to the termination of certain supply agreements due to our choice to exit the Adrian, MI facility in June 2015 and the timing of orders for our industrial water treatment products.  Strong sales of Emerald Innovation 3000   TM   , the return of our bromine sales to levels prior to the strike at a supplier in 2015 and improved volumes in our organometallic products offset these volume declines.  Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment showed volume declines that were the result of changing from a supply agreement to a tolling agreement at our Brazil location.  This impacted net sales for the value of the raw material component that is no longer purchased or sold by us as required under the tolling arrangement. 
  Gross profit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $365 million  , an increase of   $36 million   compared with the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to   29%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   24%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in gross profit was primarily due to lower raw material and distribution costs, favorable manufacturing absorption variances primarily for our Emerald Innovation 3000  and organometallic products, overall favorable product mix and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange translation offset in part by the effect of lower sales prices. 
  SG A expenses of   $105 million   were $8 million lower than the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The reduction is related to lower pension expense, lower facility costs as a result of closures we made in 2015 and lower costs associated with strategic cost reduction initiatives which were completed in 2015.  Additionally, in the first nine months of 2016, we recognized income of approximately $2 million on a technology license, a $2 million charge related to the resolution of a disputed multi-year state excise tax matter and a $2 million gain on the sale of a non-operating site which was offset by the absence of a $2 million gain on a property sale which occurred in 2015. 
  Merger and integration costs reported for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $11 million   which primarily are comprised of legal and other fees associated with the signing of the agreement with Lanxess.  Additionally, included in these costs is a charge related to the commitment to surrender our Addivant preferred shares along with a cash payment of $1 million related to a modification of a non-compete agreement entered into in conjunction with the sale of our antioxidants business to Addivant in 2013, which was modified contemporaneously with the signing of our Merger Agreement with Lanxess. 
  In February 2016, the Chemtura Corporation Retirement Plan (the "US Qualified Plan") entered into a purchase agreement for a group annuity contract transferring payment responsibility for the pension benefits of certain retirees.  As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charge of $162 million.  For further information on this transaction, see Note 12 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Other Non-Operating Income and Expense 
  
   30 

Interest expense was   $24 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which increased slightly from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily due to higher capitalized interest during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   related to capital projects. 
  Other expense, net was   $3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with other income, net of   $10 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other (expense) income, net primarily reflected realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses.  The net other income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflected the significant weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar that began in late 2014. 
  Income tax expense reported for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $15 million   compared with   $43 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The tax expense reported for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflected tax expense of $3 million, recorded in the third quarter of 2016, for an increase to the valuation allowance related to our state net operating loss deferred tax asset and a tax benefit of   $33 million  , recorded in the first quarter of 2016, that related to the pension annuity transaction which was considered a discrete item for purposes of our interim tax provision. 
  Net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $37 million  , or   $0.58   per diluted share, as compared with net earnings of   $70 million  , or   $1.02   per diluted share, for the same period last year. 
  The following tables describe the major factors impacting net sales and operating income for each of our segments: 

(a) 
    "Price over raw materials" is the sum of the net changes in selling prices and the net changes in raw material costs between the two periods.  As the reduction in the costs of certain raw materials result in certain circumstances in reductions in selling prices under certain agreements, the change in selling prices net of changes in raw material costs provides a better measure of the impact of selling price changes on our profitability. 
              (b) 
    Includes facility closures, severance and related costs, merger and integration costs, loss on sale of business, impairment charges and pension settlement. 
     
   31 

The following is a discussion of the results of our segments for the   nine   month ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Industrial Performance Products 
  Our Industrial Performance segment reported lower net sales and higher operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the same period last year. 
  The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of lower sales prices and lower volume and product mix.  The majority of the lower sales prices occurred in our petroleum additive products, the result of price reductions as we passed along the benefit of raw material costs reductions to our customers as required under formula-based contract pricing agreements.  Our petroleum additive products reported overall growth in volumes for our additive and intermediate products but those gains were offset by a combination of lower volume and unfavorable product mix for certain synthetic lubricants and base stocks.  Our inhibitor and intermediate products benefited from the market tightness that was the result of a temporary shutdown of one of our Asian competitor s plants.  The majority of the lower volume and unfavorable product mix was the result of the soft market demand for our urethane products used in mining and oil and gas applications.  The softness in this market was also reflected in the lower sales prices for these products contributing to the overall lower sales prices in this segment.  
    
  Although we did not see improvement in net sales over the prior year, operating income benefited primarily from lower manufacturing and distribution costs, favorable product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange on our costs.  Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is the recognition of approximately $2 million in income on a technology license and a $2 million charge related to the resolution of a disputed multi-year state excise tax matter.  
    
  Industrial Engineered Products 
  Our Industrial Engineered segment recorded lower net sales and higher operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the same period last year. 
  Net sales for our Industrial Engineered segment reflected overall increases in sales prices despite reductions in volume and unfavorable product mix.  Sales price increases reflect market demand for our growth products such as Emerald Innovation 3000   TM    and stronger Asian bromine and bromine derivative sales prices.  We saw a modest decline in sales pricing for our organometallic products as we implemented strategies in order to assist us with volume growth.  Clear brine fluids used in offshore deep oil well drilling continue to be impacted by lower exploration activity due to the reduction in oil prices, which has unfavorably impacted both sales prices and volumes throughout 2016.  The first half of the year reflected lower volumes related to the termination of certain supply agreements due to our choice to exit the Adrian, MI facility in June 2015 and the timing of orders for our industrial water treatment products.  Strong sales of Emerald Innovation 3000   TM   , the return of our bromine sales to levels prior to the strike of our supplier in 2015 and improved volumes in our organometallic products, offset these volume declines.  Favorable foreign currency exchange additionally contributed to offset the volume and mix declines. 
  Despite lower net sales, our Industrial Engineered segment reported a $30 million increase in operating income.  The effect of volume declines on operating income were more than offset by the benefit of increased sales prices, lower raw material costs and favorable manufacturing absorption variances, primarily related to increased production for Emerald Innovation 3000   TM    and organometallic products offset by a charge of $2 million in the third quarter of 2016 related to the return of certain inventory.  Operating income in 2016 also benefited from a reduction in SG A, in part due to our cost reduction actions in 2015. 
    
  Agrochemical Manufacturing 
  The Agrochemical Manufacturing segment reported lower net sales and slightly higher operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the same period last year.  
  The decrease in net sales is primarily the result of a change from a supply agreement to a tolling agreement in Brazil which occurred in the second quarter of 2016.  The change to a tolling agreement does not impact our gross margin, as the agreement continues to only reimburse costs incurred.  However, subsequent to the change we no longer purchase or sell the raw material component of the products produced which has impacted net sales and cost of sales by similar amounts.  The results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 included $29 million in net sales and operating profit related to the non-cash amortization, net of accretion, of a below-market contract obligation that was recorded as part of the Chemtura AgroSolutions divestiture in 2014. 
  Corporate 
  
   32 

Corporate costs include those costs that are of a general nature or managed on a corporate basis.  These costs, net of allocations to the business segments, primarily represent corporate stewardship and administration activities together with costs associated with legacy activities and intangible asset amortization.  Functional costs are allocated between the business segments and general corporate expense. 
  Corporate expense was   $40 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which included amortization and depreciation expense of $7 million.  In comparison, corporate expense was   $47 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which included amortization and depreciation expense of $11 million.  Corporate expense in 2015 included a gain on the sale of a former facility in the United States which was offset by a gain on the sale of a non-operating site in the third quarter of 2016.  Corporate expense in 2016 was favorably impacted by lower accruals for environmental obligations, lower amortization, and lower pension and other post-retirement obligation expense and a reduction in functional spending. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  We believe that our cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under our U.S. and international credit facilities and our current cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to maintain our current operations and capital expenditure requirements, service our debt and pursue other strategic initiatives. 
  The following is a discussion of significant factors affecting our liquidity and use of capital resources. 
  Financing Facilities 
  Our financing facilities are comprised of public debt, several loans and a revolving line of credit. 
  Senior Notes 
  In July 2013, we issued in a registered public offering $450 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes").  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $450 million   remained outstanding. 
  Loans 
  In August 2010, we entered into a Term Loan due August 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto for an aggregate principal amount of $295 million with an original issue discount of 1% (the "Term Loan").  Repayments were made on the Term Loan with proceeds from the 2021 Senior Notes offering, sale of businesses and cash on hand.  In July 2016, we amended our Term Loan providing for a new $1 million term loan which was borrowed to refinance the existing Term Loan.  The interest rate for the new term loan is identical to and maintains substantially identical collateral, covenants, events of default, representations and warranties and other terms as the original Term Loan, but with an extended maturity date to July 2017, a waiver of the prepayment requirements for proceeds of asset sales and annual excess cash flow, and a reduction of the annual administrative agency fee.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1 million   remained outstanding. 
  We maintain a 5 year secured credit facility of CNY   250 million   (approximately   $40 million  ) available through December 2017 (the  China Bank Facility ) with Agricultural Bank of China, Nantong Branch.  The China Bank Facility has been used for funding construction of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, China and is secured by land, property and machinery of our subsidiary Chemtura Advanced Materials (Nantong) Co., Ltd.  Repayments of principal are made in semi-annual installments from December 2014 through December 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $11 million   remained outstanding. 
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
  In December 2013, we entered into a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility that provides for $175 million available to our domestic subsidiaries (the "US ABL Facility") and  60 million available to Chemtura Sales Europe B.V., a Netherlands subsidiary (the  Foreign ABL Facility , and together with the US ABL Facility, the  2018 ABL Facility ), subject in each case to availability under a borrowing base.  The 2018 ABL Facility provides a $125 million letter of credit sub-facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had no borrowings under the 2018 ABL Facility.  However, we had   $12 million   of outstanding letters of credit (primarily related to insurance obligations, environmental obligations and banking credit facilities) which utilizes available capacity under the facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $164 million   of undrawn availability under the 2018 ABL Facility. 
  
   33 

Covenants 
  These financing facilities, excluding the China Bank Facility, contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to enter into certain transactions, such as creating liens, incurring additional indebtedness or repaying certain indebtedness, making investments, paying dividends, and entering into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of these financing facilities. 
  For further discussion of the financing facilities, see Note 7   Debt in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  In   October 2014  , the Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a share repurchase authorization of up to   $500 million   conditioned upon the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business (the "October 2014 Authorization").  In   August 2015  , the Board authorized an increase to the October 2014 Authorization by   $150 million  , up to   $650 million   in the aggregate when combined with the October 2014 Authorization, and extended the program to December 1, 2016.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   4.5 million   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $116 million  .   The remaining authorization under this program was   $54 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The shares are expected to be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases.  The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the Board s discretion.  The manner, price, number and timing of such repurchases, if any, will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and the applicable rules and regulations of the Security and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
  We do not currently anticipate undertaking further repurchases in light of our Merger Agreement with Lanxess. 
    
  Pension Annuity Transaction 
  In February 2016, the US Qualified Plan entered into a purchase agreement for a group annuity contract transferring payment responsibility for retirement pension benefits of approximately 5,000 retirees in the U.S. or their designated beneficiaries.  By irrevocably transferring the pension obligations, our overall projected pension benefit obligation has been reduced by $363 million, based on the valuation date as of February 17, 2016.  The annuity purchase price was $354 million and was funded by the assets of the US Qualified Plan.  Additionally, we contributed $35 million of cash to the US Qualified Plan during the first quarter of 2016 to maintain the US Qualified Plan's funded status at the approximate level that existed prior to the pension annuity transaction.  With this cash contribution to the US Qualified Plan, we do not currently anticipate further cash contributions to the US Qualified Plan in 2016 and the level of cash contributions in future years will now be lower than we would have projected prior to the pension annuity transaction.  Additional information is included in Note 12 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Agrochemical Manufacturing Supply Agreements 
  Contemporaneous with the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business to Platform Specialty Products Corporation ("Platform") in 2014, we entered into several supply agreements and a tolling agreement (collectively, the "supply agreements") with minimum terms of between two and four years.  The supply agreements are designed to recover the cash costs incurred to manufacture the products under the agreements.  Due to these economics, the supply agreements are considered below-market contracts for their full term.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our Consolidated Balance Sheet included   $155 million  , which represented the remaining loss of profit, on a discounted basis, for these products over the remaining terms of the supply agreements, including contractual obligations to continue to supply for a period of up to 2 years after termination of the supply agreements. 
  The recognition of this obligation, along with the accretion of the obligation to its undiscounted value, has been and will continue to be recorded as net sales in the Agrochemical Manufacturing segment on a straight-line basis over the term of each supply agreement based on our estimate of the timing of shipments.  The recognition of this obligation will not generate cash flows during the term of the supply agreements. 
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $87 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   $117 million   in the same period last year.  Changes in key accounts are summarized below: 
  
   34 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , accounts receivable represented a use of cash flows of   $7 million   from December 31, 2015, primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable due to net sales in both our Industrial Performance and Industrial Engineered segments being higher in the third quarter of 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Historically, fourth quarter net sales are lower due in part to planned customer shutdowns and holidays compared to third quarter net sales. Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment accounts receivable also declined, primarily as a result of the switch to a tolling agreement in Brazil in 2016 where we no longer sell to Platform the raw material used in our production.  Inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 represented a use of cash flows by $11 million which is primarily the result of a required build in inventory as we prepare for plant maintenance shutdowns coupled with the decline in net sales for products such as our clear brine fluids, due to the slower market demand for these products during 2016.  Our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment inventory was down slightly due to the change in value of that inventory as a result of the switch to a tolling agreement noted earlier.  Accounts payable represented a source of cash of $5 million mainly the result of an accrual for charges incurred related to the announcement of the Merger which occurred late in the third quarter of 2016. 
  Pension and post-retirement benefit plans represented a use of cash flows of   $57 million   primarily due to the $35 million contribution to the US Qualified Plan described earlier.  Cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities were $57 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which included $42 million for domestic plans and $15 million for international plans. 
  Cash flows from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges.  Non-cash charges included the pension settlement charge of   $162 million   in connection with the pension annuity transaction, depreciation and amortization expense of   $64 million  , share-based compensation expense of   $9 million   and merger and integration costs related to the modification of the non-compete agreement with Addivant of   $4 million  , offset by the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of   $29 million  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , accounts receivable represented a source of cash flows of   $8 million   from December 31, 2014, primarily related to a decrease in sales in our Industrial Engineered segment particularly in September 2015 compared with sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 which was offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable in our Industrial Performance segment as a result of timing of shipments.  Inventories represented a use of cash flows of   $3 million   which represented an increase in inventory in our Agrochemical Manufacturing segment as we are produced more inventory under our supply agreements with Platform to meet the needs of their upcoming growing season offset by a reduction in inventory in our Industrial Performance segment due primarily to the lower cost of raw materials.  Accounts payable represented a use of cash flows of   $1 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which is the result of lower purchases of raw materials in China for our Industrial Performance segment somewhat offset by an increase in our Industrial Engineered segment.  Pension and post-retirement health care liabilities represented a use of cash flows of   $25 million   primarily due to the funding of benefit obligations.  Cash contributions to fund pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities were $27 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   which included $21 million for domestic plans and $6 million for international plans. 
  Cash flows from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were adjusted by the impact of certain non-cash and other charges.  Non-cash charges included depreciation and amortization expense of   $70 million   and share-based compensation expense of   $9 million  , offset by the recognition of the obligation, net of accretion, for the below-market obligations with Platform of   $29 million  . 
  Cash Flows from Investing and Financing Activities 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used by investing activities was   $62 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which related to capital expenditures for U.S. and international facilities and environmental and other compliance requirements.  
  
   35 

Net cash provided by investing activities was   $4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Investing activities included net proceeds from the sale of the Platform shares of   $54 million  , offset by capital expenditures of   $53 million   for U.S. and international facilities and environmental and other compliance requirements. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $151 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of   4.5 million   shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a cost of   $116 million  .  Also included in financing activities was a repayment of   $39 million   on our Term Loan during the second quarter of 2016. 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $186 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Financing activities primarily included the repurchase of 5.8 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a cost of $140 million as well as the repayment of $42 million of the Term Loan as well as the repayment of $15 million in principal of the China Bank Facility.  Other financing sources in the period were $13 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
  Contractual Obligations and Other Cash Requirements 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we made aggregate contributions of $52 million to our U.S. and international pension plans and $5 million to our post-retirement benefit plans.  Based on the minimum amounts required by law or contractual obligation, we will make approximately $6 million of contributions to certain of these plans during the remainder of 2016.  From time to time, we may elect to make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified and international pension plans. 
  We had net liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of   $28 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will remain unchanged within the next 12 months. 
  Guarantees 
  In addition to   $12 million   in outstanding letters of credit at   September 30, 2016  , we have guarantees that have been provided to various financial institutions.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $6 million   of outstanding guarantees primarily related to vendor deposits.  The letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to liabilities for insurance obligations, environmental obligations, banking credit facilities, vendor deposits and European value added tax ( VAT ) obligations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  Our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Accounting Policies footnote in our 2015 Form 10-K describe the critical accounting estimates and accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Additionally, information in Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements filed in Item 1 on this Form 10-Q describes any further accounting policies that we utilize for interim reporting purposes.  Actual results could differ from management s estimates and assumptions.  There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  OUTLOOK 
  In 2016, we continue to build upon the improvements in our earnings and cash flows we achieved in 2015 to deliver further performance improvement.  We drive that improvement by continuing our focus on  managing what we can control .  The results are evident in our performance in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  Excluding the pre-tax $162 million pension settlement charge ($129 million after tax) associated with the pension annuity purchased in the first quarter of 2016 and the merger and integration costs of $11 million in the third quarter of 2016, operating income has increased by 41% and earnings before income taxes has increased by 34%.  Net earnings and earnings per share (excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge and the merger and integration costs) have grown by higher percentages, but they also reflect a lower 2016 year-to-date tax rate than in 2015. 
  
   36 

We anticipate that we will continue to deliver year-on-year improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter of 2016 and that we are currently on a path to deliver an increase in full year profitability compared to full year 2015 that is in line with our guidance at the start of the year. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2016 was $87 million which includes a cash contribution of $35 million to our US Qualified Plan in the first quarter of 2016 directly as a result of the pension annuity purchase transaction.  This contribution was made to maintain the funding level of the US Qualified Plan at approximately the same percentage level as existed prior to the pension annuity transaction.  Excluding this cash contribution, net cash provided by operating activities was $122 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $117 million the same period in 2015.  For the full year of 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $159 million.  We believe we are on track to deliver a comparable or greater amount for 2016. 
  There are a number of risks to achieving our business plans as described in Item 1A - Risk Factors in our 2015 Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  This Item should be read in conjunction with Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  The fair market value of long-term debt is subject to interest rate risk.  Our total debt was   $479 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  The fair market value of such debt as of   September 30, 2016   was   $507 million  , which has been determined primarily based on quoted market prices. 
  We did not have any material financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There have been no other significant changes in market risk during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   37 

ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  (a)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act.  Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
  (b)   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.                OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  See Note 13   Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A.  Risk Factors 
  Our risk factors are described in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Investors are encouraged to review those risk factors in detail before making any investment in our securities.  Except as set forth below related to the proposed Merger, there have been no significant changes in our risk factors during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The proposed Merger may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. 
  On September 25, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Lanxess and Merger Subsidiary.  Completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote; the receipt of necessary antitrust and regulatory approvals and the accuracy of representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement.  Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including the following: 
             
    If the Merger is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire Chemtura for consideration that is equivalent or more attractive than that in the Merger Agreement, on terms acceptable to us, our stock price may decline. 
                
    We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed.  Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger. 
     The announcement of the proposed Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  The announcement of the proposed Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our ongoing business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.  These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger: 
             
    the diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the Merger  
                
    the impairment of our ability to retain and hire key personnel, including our senior management  
                
    difficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers and others with whom we conduct business  and 
                
    potential litigation relating to the Merger and the costs related thereto. 

ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During the   Third   Quarter of   2016 
  In   October 2014  , the Board approved a share repurchase authorization of up to   $500 million   conditioned upon the sale of the Chemtura AgroSolutions business (the "October 2014 Authorization").  In   August 2015  , the Board authorized an increase to the October 2014 Authorization by   $150 million  , up to   $650 million   in the aggregate when combined with the October 2014 Authorization, and extended the program to December 1, 2016.  
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   4.5 million   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $116 million  .  The remaining authorization under this program was   $54 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   39 

The shares are expected to be repurchased from time to time through open market purchases.  The program, does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, may be modified or suspended at any time at the Board s discretion.  The manner, price, number and timing of such repurchases, if any, will be subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  We do not currently anticipate undertaking further repurchases in light of our Merger Agreement with Lanxess. 
  The following table provides information about our repurchases of equity securities during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures 
  Not Applicable. 

ITEM 5.  Other Information 
  Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ("JCPOA"), the United States provided for certain sanctions relief for Iran, including a new general license for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms to engage in Iran-related business activities that are consistent with the JCPOA.  Under this general license, our foreign subsidiary Chemtura Sales Europe BV engaged in permissible sales of certain organometallic products, generating less than $1 million in sales and profit during the   third   quarter of 2016.
