Notes To Financial Statements 

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies 

The unaudited financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. These statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in MEDITECH's Form 10-K filed on January 29, 2016. The unaudited financial statements presented herein have not been audited by our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), but in the opinion of management such financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly MEDITECH's financial position, operating results and cash flow. 

Note 2. Available For Sale Securities 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 320-10, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires marketable securities be classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. MEDITECH classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale and records them at fair value with any unrealized after-tax gains or losses reported as a component of shareholder equity. The fair value was determined based on quoted prices in active markets. ASC 320-10 requires that for each individual security classified as available-for-sale, a company shall determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is temporary in nature. If the decline in fair value is not judged as such, the cost basis of the individual security shall be reduced to fair value and the amount of the write-down shall be reflected in earnings. 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 320-10-35 Subsequent Measurement, and evaluates its marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairment using an impairment model consistent with a debt security. The factors considered include the severity and duration of the loss, the intent and ability to hold the securities for an extended period of time until recovery, and whether issuers are current on dividend payments and maintain investment grade ratings. Finally, the effect of fluctuating interest rates, current economic and industry conditions, and the issuers' current financial position are also taken into consideration. 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which provides for expanded disclosure and guidelines to determine fair market value of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. MEDITECH's marketable securities, comprised of common and preferred stock, represent assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and are considered Level 1 assets as defined by ASC 820-10. 

The following table indicates the original cost, unrealized pre-tax gains and losses, and fair market value of MEDITECH's marketable securities using specific identification. The unrealized after-tax gains and losses have been accounted for within comprehensive income. There are no pre-tax losses as of September 30, 2016.

Note 3. Equity Method Investments 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 323-10, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, and as such, accounts for the equity investment in Meditech South Africa in accordance with the cost method. Meditech South Africa licenses MEDITECH's software technology and re-licenses it to its respective customers. Meditech South Africa serves a market niche which is part of the overall medical market but is outside of the health care market which MEDITECH serves. MEDITECH holds a fully collateralized mortgage note for a loan to Meditech South Africa to purchase land and a building used as its corporate headquarters. MEDITECH believes the fair value of this investment and loan balance approximates its September 30, 2016 carrying value. 

During the 2nd quarter 2007 MEDITECH acquired Patient Care Technologies, Inc. (PtCT), a company engaged in the development, manufacture, licensing and support of computer software products for the home health care market. MEDITECH accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations. PtCT merged with and into MEDITECH effective December 31, 2009. 

During the 1st quarter 2011 MEDITECH acquired LSS Data Systems, Inc. (LSS), a company engaged in the development, manufacture, licensing and support of ambulatory information system software for physician practices. MEDITECH accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations. LSS merged with and into MEDITECH effective December 31, 2013. 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 350-20-35 Intangibles and Goodwill Impairment Evaluation - Qualitative Testing. MEDITECH annually assesses qualitative factors of its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The evaluation assesses all relevant economic, industry, regulatory, and legal facts and circumstances as well as overall performance. If, after assessing the totality of such facts and circumstances, MEDITECH determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount, then no further goodwill impairment testing is necessary. 

Note 4. Income Tax Accounting 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred taxes relate to the earlier recognition of certain revenue and the later recognition of certain expenses for tax purposes. They also relate to the increase in fair market value over the cost basis of marketable securities. Tax reserves relate to the uncertainty of state nexus. Key judgments are reviewed annually and adjusted to reflect current assessments. The years 2013 through 2015 are subject to examination by the IRS, and various years are subject to examination by state tax authorities. 

The research tax credit was not utilized during the first 3 quarters of 2015 in determining the federal income tax. Congress permanently restored the research tax credit in the 4th quarter 2015 and MEDITECH has reflected the tax credit in the federal income tax provision thereafter. 

Note 5. Earnings Per Share 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share, which requires reporting both basic and diluted earnings per share. MEDITECH has no common share equivalents such as preferred stock, warrants or stock options which would dilute earnings per share. Thus, earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. In general, the average number of shares reflects the annual issuance of shares sold to staff members in February pursuant to the 2004 Stock Purchase Plan and contributed to the MEDITECH Profit Sharing Trust in December.

Note 6. Comprehensive Income Presentation 

Effective January 1, 2012 MEDITECH adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in equity including items such as unrealized after-tax gains or losses on marketable securities classified as available for sale, foreign currency translation adjustments and minimum pension liability adjustments. In MEDITECH's case net income plus the change in unrealized after-tax security gains is shown as comprehensive income in the income statement. 

Note 7. Segment Reporting 

MEDITECH follows the provisions of ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting. Based on the criteria set forth in ASC 280-10, MEDITECH currently operates in one operating segment, medical software and services. MEDITECH derives most of its operating revenue from the sale and support of one group of similar products and services. All of MEDITECH's assets are located within the United States. The following table indicates the operating revenue percentage based on location of customer. 

Note 8. Recent Accounting Pronouncement 

Effective January 1, 2016 MEDITECH adopted ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes, Balance Sheet, Classification of Deferred Taxes. This update provides for a simplified presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be now classified as noncurrent and adopted retrospectively.

Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operating Results and Financial Condition  

Total revenue from both existing and new customers decreased by $8.1 million, composed of a $9.6 million reduction in product revenue due primarily to lower product bookings, offset by a $1.5 million addition in service revenue. 

Operating expense decreased by $13.5 million or 13.2% due primarily to lower staff related expenses, most of which was due to a non-recurring reduction in accrued bonus. The resultant operating income increased by $5.4 million. 

Other income increased by $6.1 million due primarily to higher realized pre-tax marketable securities gains. Other expense decreased by $0.2 million. The resultant pre-tax income increased by $11.7 million or 58.3%. 

MEDITECH's effective tax rate decreased from 32.4% to 20.0% due primarily to a state apportionment change and associated amended filings for prior years. Net income increased by $11.8 million due primarily to lower staff related expenses and higher realized pre-tax marketable securities gains. 

Total revenue from both existing and new customers increased by $0.4 million, composed of a $8.3 million reduction in product revenue due primarily to lower product bookings, offset by a $8.7 million addition in service revenue. 

Operating expense decreased by $8.0 million or 2.6% due primarily to lower staff related expenses, most of which was due to a non-recurring reduction in accrued bonus. The resultant operating income increased by $8.4 million. 

Other income increased by $1.5 million due primarily to higher realized pre-tax marketable securities gains. Other expense decreased by $0.9 million. The resultant pretax income increased by $10.8 million or 15.0%. 

MEDITECH's effective tax rate decreased from 29.9% to 26.9% due primarily to a state apportionment change and associated amended filings for prior years. Net income increased by $10.1 million due primarily to lower staff related expenses and higher realized pre-tax marketable securities gains. 

Page 9 of 11 

Accrued expenses decreased by $9.7 million during the period due primarily to the payment of $32.5 million in bonuses applicable to 2015 offset by the accrual of $21.5 million in bonus expenses applicable to 2016. 

Deferred tax liabilities increased by $4.3 million during the period due primarily to a larger unrealized after-tax gain of marketable securities. 

At September 30, 2016 MEDITECH's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $356.2 million. Marketable securities consisted of preferred and common equities. For the first nine months of 2016 cash flow from operations was $49.6 million, cash flow from investing was $6.3 million and cash flow used in financing was $69.2 million. The payment of $69.2 million in dividends to shareholders was the primary use of cash generated by operating and investing activities during the period. 

MEDITECH has no long-term debt. Shareholder equity at September 30, 2016 was $537.1 million. Management anticipates additions to fixed assets will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for product development, sales and marketing, implementation, service and administrative staff. Management believes existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expense requirements for the foreseeable future. 

Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

There have been no material changes from the market risk disclosed in MEDITECH's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4 - Controls and Procedures  

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of MEDITECH's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, on the effectiveness of MEDITECH's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded MEDITECH's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at September 30, 2016 to ensure information requiring disclosure by MEDITECH in reports which it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no changes in MEDITECH's internal control over financial reporting occurring during the fiscal quarter covered by this report which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect MEDITECH's internal control over financial reporting.
