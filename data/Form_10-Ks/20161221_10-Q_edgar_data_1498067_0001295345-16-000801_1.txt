Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
	   Basis of Presentation and
	Organization   
	  Techcare Corp. ("Techcare " or the "Company") formally
	known as BreedIT corp. is a Delaware corporation. The Company was
	incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 26, 2010. The
	company originally engaged in agriculture breeding and its business plan was
	to develop and market the IDSS software system globally.  
	  On February 10, 2016, Techcare Corp., a Delaware
	corporation (the "Registrant," the "Company  or "Techcare") filed a Form 8-K
	reporting that on February 8, 2016, it had signed a Merger Agreement (the
	"Merger Agreement" or the "Agreement") with Novomic Corp., a private Company
	organized under the laws of the State of Israel ("Novomic"). On August 9,
	2016, the closing of the merger occurred, pursuant to which Novomic became a
	wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant.  
	  The following disclosure information constitutes the
	Registrant's Form 10 Disclosure regarding its new, wholly-owned operating
	subsidiary, Novomic, effective as of the Closing of the Merger Agreement. In
	connection with the Closing, the Registrant's name will be changed from
	BreedIT Corp. to Novomic Corp. (the  Name Change  (ii) the 149,219,173
	outstanding shares of the Registrant's Common Stock will be subject to a
	reverse split on a one-for-thirty (1:30) basis (the  Reverse Split )
	resulting in 4,973,972 outstanding Shares of Common Stock; and (iii) the
	authorization of ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par
	value $0.0001 (the  Preferred Stock ), which may be issued in one or more
	classes or series, having such designations, preferences, privileges and
	rights as the Board of Directors may determine. The foregoing are referred
	to collectively, as the  Corporate Actions  and are subject to the approval
	of FINRA following the filing of an Information Statement on Schedule 14C.
	Pursuant to the terms of the above-referenced Shareholders' Agreement, the
	Registrant, Novomic and the Novomic shareholders agreed that following the
	Closing, the Registrant's Board of Directors shall consist of three persons,
	one of whom will be designated by the present BreedIT shareholders and the
	remaining two will be designated by the Novomic shareholders  
	  The 4,973,972 post-Reverse Shares presently outstanding
	will represent 26.47% of the 14,876,090 total outstanding Shares after the
	issuance of 9,902,118 post-Reverse Split Shares, representing 66.56% of the
	total outstanding Shares, to the Novomic shareholders.   
	  On October 31, 2016, following the closing of the merger
	agreement between TechCare Corp., f/k/a BreedIT Corp. (the  Registrant ) and
	Novomic Ltd. and the appointment of new members to the Registrant's Board of
	Directors as disclosed below, the Registrant's Board of Directors accepted
	the resignation of Mr. Erez Zino as a director, effective immediately. Mr.
	Zino was a founder of a predecessor of the Registrant and a former principal
	stockholder, executive officer and a director of the Registrant. Mr. Zino
	served as CEO from July 2012 and became acting CFO in January 2013. In
	connection with the acquisition of 66.67% of BreedIT Israel in January 2014,
	Mr. Zino resigned as an executive officer of the Company but continued to
	serve as a director.  
	  Also on October 31, 2016, the Board of Directors accepted
	the resignation of Liran Chen as Chief Executive Officer, effective
	immediately.  
	  In addition, in connection with the change in control and
	the appointment of new management, the Board of Directors also accepted the
	resignation of Oded Gilboa as Chief Financial Officer, effective October 31,
	2016. Mr. Gilboa was appointed as the Registrant's CFO on December 4, 2013.
	  
	  Effective October 31, 2016, the Registrant's Board of
	Directors appointed: (i) Zvi Yemini, the Registrant's Chairman, as Chief
	Executive Officer; (ii) Messrs. Mordechai Bignitz, Oren Traistman and Yossef
	De-Levy to the Registrant's Board of Directors; and (iii) Josh Johnson as
	the Registrant's new Chief Financial Officer, following the resignation of
	Oded Gilboa as CFO.  
	  The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the
	Company are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and
	Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures
	normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and
	regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
	normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for an air presentation
	have been made. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared to
	reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of the Company.  
	  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going
	concern. The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its
	operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since
	inception. Further, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the cash
	resources of the Company were insufficient to meet its current business
	plan. This and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's
	ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial
	statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
	effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
	and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible
	inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  
	   Significant Accounting Policies   
	   Use of Estimates:    
	  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
	of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates.  
	   Cash and Cash Equivalents:    
	  For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company
	considers those short-term, highly liquid investments with original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. As of
	September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no cash equivalents.  
	   Other Receivables:   
	  The company treats VAT refunds claimed resulting from
	excess VAT paid over VAT received as other receivables.  
	  Currency translation and other comprehensive loss: balance
	sheet items are translated using all-current translation method for
	Self-contained foreign operations (where functional currency = foreign
	currency) whereby assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange
	rate on the date of the balance sheet. It translates revenues, expenses, and
	net income using the average exchange rate during the period. The foreign
	exchange adjustment that results from applying the all-current method
	appears in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate shareholders'
	equity account, and does not affect net income each period.  
	   Property and Equipment:   
	   Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of
	accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line
	method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The annual
	depreciation rates are as follows: Computers and electronic equipment 33%.  
	   Deferred Revenue:   
	  Deferred revenue consists
	substantially of amounts received from third party vendors in advance of the
	Company's product completion for payment of fees and expenses related to the
	product. Deferred revenue will be recognized as Other Income on a systematic
	basis that is proportionate to completion of the final product.  
	   Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:   
	  We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets
	including equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, when events or
	changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the
	asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based
	on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected
	future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the
	related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of
	such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
	estimated fair value and carrying value. Our primary measure of fair value
	is based on discounted cash flows. The measurement of impairment requires
	management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived
	assets, as well as other fair value determinations.  
	   Stock Based Compensation:   
	   Stock-based awards are accounted for using the fair value
	method in accordance with ASC 718, Share-Based Payments. Our primary type of
	share-based compensation consists of stock options. We use the Black-Scholes
	option pricing model in valuing options. The inputs for the valuation
	analysis of the options include the market value of the Company's common
	stock, the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock, the exercise
	price of the warrants and the risk free interest rate.  
	   Accounting For Obligations And Instruments Potentially
	To Be Settled In The Company's Own Stock:    
	  We account for obligations and instruments potentially to
	be settled in the Company's stock in accordance with FASB ASC
	815, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments. This issue addresses
	the initial balance sheet classification and measurement of contracts that
	are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the Company's own stock.  
	   Fair Value of Financial Instruments:   
	  Pursuant to ASC No. 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
	Disclosures , the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all
	financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and
	December 31, 2015. The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and
	derivative liabilities.  The Company considers the carrying value of such
	amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to
	the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  
	  The Company adopted ASC No. 820-10 (ASC 820-10), Fair
	Value Measurements. ASC 820-10 relates to financial assets and financial
	liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
	measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
	measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting
	pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be
	applied prospectively with limited exceptions.  
	  ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be
	received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This
	standard is now the single source in GAAP for the definition of fair value,
	except for the fair value of leased property as defined in SFAS 13. ASC
	820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
	(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained
	from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity's own
	assumptions, about market participant assumptions, that are developed based
	on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
	inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which
	gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
	identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
	unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
	under ASC 820-10 are described below:  
	  Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in
	active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical,
	unrestricted assets or liabilities. 
	  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices
	included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
	either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or
	liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets
	or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted
	prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest
	rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
	observable market data by correlation or other means. 
	  Level 3. Inputs that are both
	significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These inputs
	rely on management's own assumptions about the assumptions that market
	participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. (The unobservable
	inputs are developed based on the best information available in the
	circumstances and July include the Company's own data.) 
	 The following presents the Company's
	fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value
	on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Going Concern:    
	  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going
	concern. The Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its
	operating costs, and as such, has incurred an operating loss since
	inception. Further, as of September 30, 2016, the cash resources of the
	Company were insufficient to meet its current business plan, and the Company
	had negative working capital. These and other factors raise substantial
	doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
	assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
	the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  
	   Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
	  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,
	Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt
	Instruments. The new standard simplifies the embedded derivative analysis
	for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options by removing
	the requirement to assess whether a contingent event is related to interest
	rates or credit risks. The new standard will be effective for us on January
	1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on
	our financial position or results of operations.  
	  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,
	Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the
	Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The new standard eliminates
	the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity
	method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or
	degree of influence, an adjustment must be made to the investment, results
	of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as
	if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the
	investment had been held. The new standard will be effective for us on
	January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
	material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  
	  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
	Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
	Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new standard requires recognition of the
	income tax effects of vested or settled awards in the income statement and
	involves several other aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
	transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
	awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement
	of cash flows. The new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2017.
	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on
	our financial position, results of operations or statements of cash flows
	upon adoption.  
	  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial
	Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on
	Financial Instruments. The new standard changes the impairment model for
	most financial assets and certain other instruments. Under the new standard,
	entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not
	accounted for at fair value through net income to be presented at the net
	amount expected to be collected. An allowance for credit losses will be a
	valuation account that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the
	financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to
	be collected on the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for
	us on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have
	a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  
	  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement
	of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
	Payments. The new standard clarifies certain aspects of the statement of
	cash flows, including the classification of debt prepayment or debt
	extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other
	debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in
	relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent
	consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the
	settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of
	corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity
	method investees and beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
	The new standard also clarifies that an entity should determine each
	separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash
	payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. In
	situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one
	class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use, the
	appropriate classification should depend on the activity that is likely to
	be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item. The new
	standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this
	standard is not expected to have a material impact on our statements of cash
	flows upon adoption.  
	  In September, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-16,
	Business Combinations (Topic 805) ( ASU 2015-16 ). Topic 805 requires that
	an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a
	business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the
	accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in
	the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional
	amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting
	period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is
	required to also record, in the same period's financial statements, the
	effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income
	effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts,
	calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
	In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the
	income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the
	portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that
	would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to
	the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU
	2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The
	adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the
	Company's consolidated financial statements.  
	  In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date
	( ASU 2015-14 ). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU
	No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain
	not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the
	guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15,
	2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
	Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with
	that reporting period.  
	  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,
	Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which
	changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU
	2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a
	direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.
	Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense.
	It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2016. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied
	retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in
	the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its
	balance sheets.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.    Back to Table of Contents   

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The following plan of operation provides information which management
believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of
operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our
financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of
forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future
events and financial performance. Certain statements that the Company may make
from time to time, including all statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are
not statements of historical fact, constitute  forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and
the safe harbor provisions set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking
statements may be identified by words such as  plans,   expects,   believes, 
 anticipates,   estimates,   projects,   will,   should,  and other words of
similar meaning used in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of
future operations, financial performance, product development and new product
launches, market position and expenditures. The Company assumes no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors
which could cause differences between forward-looking statements and future
actual results is discussed under the heading  Risk Factors  in the Company's
Current Report on Form 8-k/12g, as filed with the SEC on November 10, 2016. You

	 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to help you understand our
	historical results of operations during the periods presented and our
	financial condition for the period ended September 30, 2016 and December 31,
	2015. This MD A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
	financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial
	statements, together with the financial statements of Novomic Ltd for the
	years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the interim period ended
	March 31, 2016, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
	uncertainties. See section entitled  Forward-Looking Statements  above. It
	should be understood that as a result of the Closing of the Merger Agreement
	with Novomic on August 9, 2016, our historical results are not expected to
	be indicative of our future results. 

Overview and Recent Developments    
	 
	 We are a company with limited operations and no significant revenues from
	our business operations. There is substantial doubt that we can continue as
	an on-going business for the next twelve months without the success of our
	new business operations of Novomic. We do not anticipate that Novomic will
	generate revenues from the sale of its head lice treatment platform until it
	receives regulatory approval from the CE, which is anticipated to occur
	during the year 2017, which will permit us to commence sales and marketing
	activities in Europe. Before we enter the U.S. market, we will need to
	secure approval from the FDA which should take approximately 12 months at a
	cost of approximately $150,000. 
	 As a relatively new business engaged in  start-up  operations and
	activities, we will require substantial additional funding to successfully
	launch and commercially exploit our head lice treatment platform, fund the
	costs of securing regulatory approvals that we estimate will cost
	approximately $150,000 during the next 12 months and potentially significant
	additional costs if there are any unanticipated delays. We also must fund
	the estimated $1,000,000 in additional R D expense and $850,000 in
	manufacturing and marketing costs. We project that we will need to raise
	approximately $1,200,000 during the next 12 months in order to successfully
	implement our business plan and to become profitable, of which there can be
	no assurance. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms,
	if at all, when needed, may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our
	product development efforts and secure regulatory approvals and would
	adversely impact our planned research and development efforts in connection
	with the Company's future products, which may make it more difficult for us
	to attain profitability. 

On February 10, 2016, we signed a Merger Agreement (the  Merger Agreement  or the
 Agreement ) with Novomic Ltd, a private Company organized under the laws of the State of Israel ( Novomic ) and a Shareholders' Agreement with the Novomic shareholders (the "Shareholders' Agreement"). The Merger Agreement was by and between the Registrant, on the one hand, and Novomic together with YMY Industry Ltd ("YMY") and Microdel Ltd ("Microdel"), the latter two of which are hereinafter referred to as the "Novomic Founders," on the other hand. On
August 9, 2016, the closing of the merger occurred, pursuant to which Novomic became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. 

Novomic Ltd.
( Novomic  or the  Company ) was incorporated as a private limited liability Company in Israel in 2009. Since
inception, Novomic has been a technology Company engaged in the design, development, manufacturing and commercialization of a
unique platform enabling a variety of medical treatments utilizing Novomic's proprietary device that vaporizes liquids from a
contained capsule into the treatment area (the  Device ). Novomic's first product utilizing the Device will be for the
treatment of head lice. Its first and principal product is its head lice treatment product (the  Product ) which is
comprised of three key major components: Compressor, Head Cap and Treatment Capsule. The lice treatment solution has completed
the development and prototype stages and the Company expects that in Q3 2016 it should receive CE regulatory approval (European
Union) and also expects to finalize preparations for establishing a mass production line for our Capsules, which use readily available
materials. The Company does not expect that there will be any future shortage in the availability or access to this materials
in the foreseen future. 

In a clinical
report published in 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics (the  Report ) it noted that while head lice (Pediculus
humanus capitis) has been a companion of the human species since antiquity, that
anecdotal reports from the 1990s estimated annual direct and indirect costs
totaling $367 million, including remedies and other consumer costs. The Report
stated that more recent estimates are that treatment costs are $1 billion
annually. It further noted that while head lice are not a health hazard or a
sign of poor hygiene, there is significant stigma resulting from head lice
infestations in many developed countries, resulting in children being ostracized
from their schools, friends, and other social events. The Report concluded that
optimal treatments should be safe, should rapidly rid the individual of live
lice, viable eggs, and residual nits, and should be easy to use and affordable.  

Recent Developments
and Plans  

TechCare's current
and future products are all based on the Device which was developed over a period of 7 years. During the past 18 months,
TechCare
has achieved the following: 

Performed
                                         extensive market research for the lice treatment/prevention market; 

Completed
                                         product development, which included finalization of commercial design of compressor,
                                         Capsules and head cap, optimizing the product efficiency, negotiating and finalizing
                                         the product supply chain across various suppliers; 

Received
                                         the Israeli Ministry of health approval (AMAR) to market the lice product in Israel; 

Regulation:
                                         In advance stages of obtaining CE certificate; 

Conducted
                                         extensive tests and measurements for treatment calibration protocol and efficiency; 

Obtained
                                         recommendations from leading senior pediatrics; and 

Opened
                                         Company headquarters offices in Israel s Rosh Ha ayin Industrial Park. 

During the next 12-18 months,
TechCare
plans to focus its efforts on the following: 

Finalizing
                                         distribution, OEM and JV agreements with well-known companies, in Israel and abroad; 

Further
                                         optimization of the Device platform performance; 

Reduction
                                         of manufacturing costs; 

Commencing
                                         the development and commercialization of the Company s future product line mainly
                                         to the fields of hair cosmetics and pest treatments; 

Obtain
                                         additional regulatory approvals from the following regulatory agencies CE and the FDA
                                         among others; 

Complete
                                         preparations for mass production by launching an automated capsule production line; 

Presenting
                                         the platform and its application in leading conferences around the globe; and 

Online
                                         sales of the head lice treatment platform. 

With respect to FDA approval,
TechCare
is in advanced negotiations with a US distributor which will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining FDA approval for the
head lice treatment platform including the Device and capsules. While there can be no assurance, the Company expects to sign a
binding term sheet with the US distributor in or about August 2016; and expects that the FDA approval process should take approximately
12 months at a cost of approximately $150,000. 

As a relatively new business engaged in  start-up 
operations and activities, we will require substantial additional funding to successfully launch and commercially exploit our
head lice treatment platform, fund the costs of securing regulatory approvals that we estimate will cost approximately $150,000
during the next 12 months and potentially significant additional costs if there are any unanticipated delays. We also must fund
the estimated $1,000,000 in additional R D expense and $850,000 in manufacturing and marketing costs. We project that we will
need to raise approximately $1,200,000 during the next 12 months in order to successfully implement our business plan and to become
profitable, of which there can be no assurance. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms, if at all, when
needed, may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts and secure regulatory approvals and would adversely
impact our planned research and development efforts in connection with the Company s future products, which may make it
more difficult for us to attain profitability. 

TechCare may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals
for the head lice treatment platform and its future products. If unable to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product
candidates,

TechCare  s business will be adversely affected. CE approval is required for the marketing, distributing and sale
of

TechCare  s products in the EU, whereas FDA approval for such marketing, distributing and sale in the US.  In the
event the products are to be sold in certain territories requiring additional regulatory approvals, such will be obtained by

TechCare 

and/or by its distributors. 

Our Treatment Solution  

The intuitive logic behind the Company's
approach to head-lice treatment and prevention is quite simple: In almost any living creature, the skin is built to isolate and
protect from harsh environment, while the breathing system is relatively sensitive. Our research and laboratory experiments have
made clear that lice are very sensitive to surrounding chemical vapors. Therefore, the environment created in our head cap is
saturated with vapor that clings to the lice skin and essentially suffocates them. Even the lice eggs (nits) have breathing holes
and are similarly affected. 

Unlike existing solutions, the active
ingredient in our treatment Capsules is not a nerve poison pesticide, but an organic substance, akin to vinegar, which attacks
the lice breathing system. 

Other benefits: 

Safe
                                         for use for all ages; 

Effectively
                                         kills adult lice, nymphs and eggs every time; 

No
                                         need to stay wet in the shower with the shampoo or gel on, treatment can be administered
                                         in front of TV or computer; 

Playful
                                         - colorful cap is illustrated with many designs to choose from, making the experience
                                         more acceptable by children; 

Short
                                         treatment time; 

Clean,
                                         dry treatment with no sticky residue means; and 

Multiuse
                                         device   only need to replace inexpensive cartridge .  

Sales and Marketing  

While the Compressor
component of our Product is designated to be a one-time purchase, the Head Cap and especially the Capsules will be sold separately
and based on our estimates, which we believe are both reasonable and conservative, our target customers are expected to purchase
between 12-16 Capsule units per year. Therefore, we estimate that the majority of the revenues the Company will generate in the
future will be based on Capsules sales for both treatment and prevention of head lice. 

The Company plans
to focus its initial sales and marketing efforts on two of the largest markets in the world   the EU and US markets, starting
in the EU where regulatory approval is expected in 2017. 

In order to achieve
its intended global footprint and market presence, the Company's primary distribution method will be based on the OEM model, in
which the distributor will sell our Product under its own name and branding. We believe that the OEM model will reduce our marketing
costs to a minimum while starting to generate revenues to support the our R D efforts for utilizing our technological platform
to expand our product line. 

The Company also
plans to market and advertise its products through online and e-commerce channels, which we believe will present a huge opportunity
for generating sales and market acceptance. 

Intellectual Property  

Due to the importance
of patents, the Company has devoted significant efforts and resources and will continue to invest resources in strengthening its
patent portfolio. Below is the list of patents registered by the Company to date: 

The Company plans to expand existing patents
related to pushing air using its mechanical Compressor and new substances which are now being researched and documented, and more
subjects that will be developed during research. 

Research and Development  

The Company has spent approximately
$1.3 million on R D during the past three years. During this period the Company completed the lice product development, which
included finalization of commercial design of compressor, Capsules and head cap and optimizing the product efficiency. 

The Company plans to build upon the
R D achievements it had with the completion of the head lice treatment product as the basis to expand its variety of treatments
and solutions, which will also be based on the developed platform and the knowledge the Company gained in principally during the
past three years.

	year. The significant increase was due to reverse-merger related expenses.  
	 We incurred a net loss of $220,180 and $1,027,716 during the three and nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $76,173 and $154,604 in same

	  Purchase or Sale of Equipment

	 Our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 reflects
	assets of $745,992 consisting of cash of $686,381, prepaid assets of $30,485
	and property and equipment net, of $29,126. As of December 31, 2015, the
	balance sheet reflects assets of $351,106 consisting of cash of $254,324,
	property and equipment net, of $14,445 and prepaid assets of $82,337. 
	 As of September 30, 2016, we had total current
	liabilities of $408,357 consisting of accounts payable and accrued expenses
	of $211,643, deferred revenue of $115,170 and notes payable of $81,524. 
	 As of December 31, 2015, we had total current liabilities
	of $247,188 consisting of $168,448 in accounts payable and accrued
	liabilities and $78,740 in notes payable. 
	 We had positive working capital of $337,635 as of
	September 30, 2016 compared to positive working capital of $103,918 at
	December 31, 2015. The working capital has been sufficient to sustain our
	operations to date, although please see note regarding going concern. Our
	total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $408,357 compared to
	$247,188 at December 31, 2015. 
	 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used
	$806,128 in our operating activities. This resulted from a net loss of
	$1,027,716, offset by depreciation expenses of $5,574, imputed interest
	expense of $4,923, decrease in prepaid assets of $51,852, decrease in
	accounts in accounts payable of $8,338, increase in accrued expenses of
	$52,407 and an increase in deferred revenues of $115,170. 
	 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015,

we used $177,328 in our operating activities. This resulted from a net loss
	of $154,604, offset by depreciation expenses of $5,424, an increase in
	prepaid assets of $53,914, an increase in accounts in accounts payable of
	$10,329 and an increase in accrued expenses of $15,437.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, investing activities
	provided us with of $1,121,540 due to the purchase of property and equipment
	valued at $23,391 and $1,144,931 related to the effect of our reverse
	merger.
	  
	 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we used
	$16,271 in our investing activities related to the purchase of property and
	equipment valued at $16,271. 
	 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our
	financing activities provided us with of $165,000 through the issuance of
	common stock as compared to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of
	$150,000 in the same period in the prior year. 
	 While management of the Company believes that the Company
	will be successful in its current and planned operating activities, there
	can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the achievement
	of sales of its products that will generate sufficient revenues to earn a
	profit and sustain the operations of the Company. 
	 Our ability to create sufficient working capital to
	sustain us over the next twelve month period, and beyond, is dependent on
	our entering into additional licensing agreement and on our success in
	issuing additional debt or equity, or entering into strategic arrangement
	with a third party. 
	 There can be no assurance that sufficient capital will be
	available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or
	understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of
	credit or any other sources. 
	 Going Concern Consideration 
	 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
	as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note
	disclosures with respect to this matter. 
	  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
	 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
	  Critical Accounting Policies  
	 Our significant accounting policies are described in the
	notes to our financial statements for the periods ended September 30, 2016
	and the year ended December 31, 2015, and are included elsewhere in this report on Form
	10-Q.
