Business
Overview 

Unless
otherwise indicated, we use  WMT,   the
Company,   we,   our  and
 us  in this report to refer to the businesses of Wound
Management Technologies, Inc. 

Wound
Management Technologies, Inc. ( WMT  or the
 Company ) was organized on December 14, 2001, as a
Texas corporation under the name eAppliance Innovations, Inc. In
June of 2002, MB Software Corporation, a public corporation formed
under the laws of Colorado, merged with the Company (which at the
time was a wholly owned subsidiary of MB Software Corporation), and
the Company changed its name to MB Software Corporation as part of
the merger. In May of 2008, the Company changed its name to Wound
Management Technologies, Inc. 

The
Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wound Care
Innovations, LLC (WCI), markets and sells the patented
CellerateRX  products in the expanding advanced wound care
market. CellerateRX s activated collagen, which is
approximately 1/100th the size of native collagen, delivers the
essential benefits of collagen to a wound immediately other
forms of native, intact collagen in commercially available products
require time for the body to prepare the collagen for use in the
wound healing process. CellerateRX is cleared by the FDA as a
medical device for use on all acute and chronic wounds, except
third degree burns, and is ready for distribution in both gel and
powder form. CellerateRX is currently approved for reimbursement
under Medicare Part B and no prescription is required. 

We
believe that these products are unique in composition,
applicability and clinical performance, and demonstrate the ability
to reduce costs associated with standard wound management. The
Company is focused on delivering the CellerateRX  product line
to the diabetic care and long term care markets as well as to
hospitals and operating rooms. Additionally, the Company is
studying the feasibility of three other markets where CellerateRX
formulas may have great sales potential: dental,
dermatology/plastic surgery and sunburn relief. 

The
Company is also pursuing additional product lines through its
subsidiary, Resorbable Orthopedic Products, LLC. In September 2009,
ROP acquired a patent for resorbable bone wax and bone void filler
products, which offer a solution to the problem of bone wound
healing in a cost effective manner.  The Company on
February 18, 2014 announced the receipt of FDA 510(k) clearance for
our submission for the resorbable orthopedic hemostat. In 2011, the
Company executed a development and license agreement with
BioStructures, LLC to develop products in the field of bone
remodeling, based on ROP s patent for use in the human
skeletal system.  This license agreement excludes the
fields of 1) a resorbable hemostat (resorbable bone wax), 2) a
resorbable orthopedic hemostat (resorbable bone wax) and
antimicrobial dressing, and 3) veterinary orthopedic applications.
The Company began receiving royalties under this agreement in the
fourth quarter of 2013. Royalties will continue for the life of the
patent which expires in 2023.

Management
Letter 

Wound Management Technologies, Inc. is pleased to report another
profitable quarter for 2016 with Net Income of $181,487. Third
quarter revenues were $1,409,530, an increase of approximately 56%
compared to the third quarter of 2015 whose revenues were $905,615.
Approximately 96% of revenues were from the CellerateRX product
line and the other 4% of revenue occurred in royalties from the
Resorbable Orthopedic Products, LLC subsidiary (ROP). 

2016 year-to-date revenues were $3,762,681, for the nine months
ending September 30, 2016, surpassing 2015 total net revenues of
$3,372,188 (sales through the first nine months of 2015 were
$2,664,719). 

CellerateRX revenues continue to increase as the result of
developing and carrying out our strategic initiatives to expand our
surgical product sales to new customers, develop our sales force
and to continue sales to existing customers. Our Regional Sales
Managers are working closely with our with our distributor and
representative network to increase awareness and sales. We are also
increasing our market presence with continuing case studies by key
opinion leaders. 

Our newly-cleared HemaQuell  Resorbable Bone Wax has been
used in a few cardiac, spine and orthopedic cases and ROP is now in
working with strategic partners for clinical studies. HemaQuell
received FDA 510(k) clearance in February of 2016. The Innovate OR,
Inc. subsidiary has prepared initial marketing materials for the
HemaQuell launch with initial sales anticipated before year end
2016. 

In closing, Wound Management Technologies is well positioned to
execute on its strategic growth initiatives with a solid
go-to-market plan in place and an expanding distribution
team.  The Company looks forward to capitalizing on the
traction it has built in the market thus far with additional
investments in the sales and marketing of the CellerateRX
  product and the emergence of
HemaQuell . 

Results
of Operations

2016, of $1,409,530, as compared to revenues of $905,615 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, or 56% increase in revenues.
The increase in revenues is the result of an expanded sales force
and the successful implementation of the Company s strategic
plan to continue to introduce our products into hospitals,
operating rooms and wound centers. Additionally, the Company has
recorded $50,250 in royalty revenue from the development and
license agreement the Resorbable Orthopedic Products, LLC
subsidiary (ROP) executed with BioStructures, LLC in
2011. 

Cost of goods sold . Cost of goods sold
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $211,639, as
compared to costs of goods sold of $197,117 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, or a 7% increase. The cost of goods sold
increased as a result of increase sales and changing the mix of
clinical sales as compared to surgical sales which have more
positive margins.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The
terms  WMT,   we,   the
Company,  and  us  as used in this report refer
to Wound Management Technologies, Inc. The accompanying unaudited
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and unaudited
consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10
of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the
opinion of management of WMT, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016,
or any other period. These financial statements and notes should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements for each of the
two years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, has been
derived from the audited financial statements filed in our Form
10-K and is included for comparison purposes in the accompanying
balance sheet. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of WMT and its wholly-owned subsidiaries:  Wound
Care Innovations, LLC a Nevada limited liability company
( WCI ); Resorbable Orthopedic Products, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company ( Resorbable); and Innovate OR,
Inc.  InnovateOR  formerly referred to as BioPharma
Management Technologies, Inc., a Texas corporation
( BioPharma ). All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. 

Inventories 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost
computed on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories consist of
powders, gels and the related packaging supplies. The Company
recorded inventory obsolescence expense of $15,631 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and $0 at December 31, 2015. The
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory had a balance of
$15,631 for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and $150,135 at
December 31, 2015. 

Fair Value Measurements 

As
defined in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic No. 820, fair value is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date
(exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,
including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the
inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily
observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used
to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). This fair value
measurement framework applies at both initial and subsequent
measurement. 

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC Topic No.
820 are as follows: 

Level 1
  Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are
those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on
an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial
instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable
securities and listed equities. 

Level 2
  Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active
markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or
indirectly observable as of the reported date. Level 2 includes
those financial instruments that are valued using models or other
valuation methodologies. These models are primarily
industry-standard models that consider various assumptions,
including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value,
volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for
the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic
measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in
the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be
derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels
at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Instruments
in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives
such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options and
collars. 

Level 3
  Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are
generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in
management s best estimate of fair value. 

9 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company s financial instruments
consist of the derivative liabilities related to stock purchase
warrants. The derivative liability on stock purchase warrants was
valued using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, a Level 3
input. The fair value of the conversion features associated with
the convertible debt was estimated in accordance with ASC Topic No.
470-20-25-4. The change in fair value of the derivative liabilities
is classified in other income (expense) in the statement of
operations. 

Our
intangible assets have also been valued using the fair value
accounting treatment and a description of the methodology used,
including the valuation category, is described in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Income (Loss) Per Share 

The
Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  Topic No. 260,
 Earnings per Share,  which requires the Company to
present basic and dilutive income (loss) per share when the effect
is dilutive. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing
loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares available. Diluted income (loss) per share
is computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that
the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential
common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares
were dilutive. The dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible
preferred stock for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was
85,689,772 shares and an adjustment to net income of $75,032. The
outstanding options, warrants and convertible notes were excluded
from the calculation of dilutive income (loss) per share as their
effect would have been antidilutive for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN 

The Company has continuously incurred losses from operations, has a
working capital deficit, and has a significant accumulated deficit.
The appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent
upon the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or equity
capital and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern. 

These
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon the success of the Company in obtaining
additional funding and the success of its future operations. The
ability of the Company to achieve these objectives cannot be
determined at this time. 

NOTE 3   NOTES PAYABLE 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid a total
of $2,700 to Quest Capital as part of the furniture purchase
agreement in the original amount of $11,700. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid a total
of $175,552 which included 8,552 of interest to Tonaquint, Inc. as
part of the outstanding convertible note in the original amount of
$200,000. 

On July
25, 2016, the Company negotiated the terms of a Secured
Subordinated Promissory Note and Dr. Geoff Read, an Individual to
amend the payment terms. The principal of the Promissory Note shall
be due and payable on July 1, 2017 and the interest on the Note
shall not accrue and the total interest to be charged shall be
$7,647.88. Monthly payments beginning August 1, 2016 and ending
October 1, 2016 are to be $1,000. Beginning November 1, 2016 and
ending July 1, 2017 monthly payments are to be

NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES 

As of
December 31, 2013, the Company did not have a sufficient number of
common shares authorized to fulfill the possible exercise of all
outstanding warrants and the conversion of all convertible notes
payable. As a result, the Company determined that the warrants and
the embedded conversion features of the outstanding debt
instruments did not qualify for equity classification. Accordingly,
the warrants and conversion features were treated as derivative
liabilities and were carried at fair value. During the year ended
December 31, 2015, all of the outstanding convertible notes that
qualified as derivative liabilities were paid in full or converted
to common stock. As of September 30, 2016, only 10,000 warrants
remained as derivative liabilities due to the existence of reset
provisions that qualify the instruments as derivative liabilities
under FASB ASC 815. 

The
following table sets forth the fair value hierarchy within our
financial assets and liabilities by level that they were accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of the derivative warrant
liabilities by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the
derivative liabilities related to the conversion features in the
outstanding convertible notes using the lack-Scholes Option Pricing
Model assuming maximum value, Level 3 inputs, with the following
assumptions used: 

The
following table sets forth the changes in the fair value of
derivative liabilities for the nine months ended September 30,
2016: 

The
aggregate gain on derivative liabilities for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $118.
