     UA GRANITE CORPORATION      NOTES  TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (Unaudited)    NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY   UA Granite Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated on February 14, 2013 in the State of Nevada.   The  Company  does  not     have  any  revenues  and  has     incurred  losses  since  inception.  Currently,     the   Company has    no    operations,    has    been    issued    a    going    concern    opinion    and    relies    upon    loans    from    related   parties to maintain operations.   GOING CONCERN   These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will   continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year.  Realization value may   be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not include any   adjustments  to     the     recoverability  and     classification  of  recorded     asset     amounts     and  classification  of   liabilities    that    might    be    necessary    should    the    Company    be    unable    to    continue    as    a    going    concern.  As    of   September    30,    2016,    the    Company    has    a    working    capital    deficiency,    has    not    generated    revenues    and    has   accumulated    losses    since    inception.  The    continuation    of    the    Company    as    a    going    concern    is    dependent   upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability   of the Company to obtain necessary   equity    financing    to    continue    operations,    and    the    attainment    of    profitable    operations.  These    factors    raise   substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.    NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    BASIS OF PRESENTATION   These  financial  statements  and  related  notes  are  presented  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles   generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s fiscal year-end   is March 31.   USE OF ESTIMATES   The    preparation    of    financial    statements    in    accordance    with    U.S.    generally accepted    accounting    principles   requires    management    to    make    estimates    and    assumptions    that    affect    the    reported    amounts    of    assets    and   liabilities    at    the    date    of    the    financial    statements    and    the    reported    amounts    of    net    revenue    and    expenses    in   the    reporting    period.    We    regularly    evaluate    our    estimates    and    assumptions    related    to    the    useful    life    and   recoverability    of    long-lived    assets,    stock-based    compensation    and    deferred    income    tax    asset    valuation   allowances.    We    base    our    estimates    and    assumptions    on    current    facts,    historical    experience    and    various   other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis   for    making    judgments    about    the    carrying    values    of    assets    and    liabilities    and    the    accrual    of    costs    and   expenses    that    are    not    readily    apparent    from    other    sources.    The    actual    results    experienced    by    us    differ   materially    and    adversely    from    our    estimates.    To    the    extent    there    are    material    differences    between    our   estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.   8           UA GRANITE CORPORATION     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (Unaudited)    NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Continued   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   The    Company    considers    all    highly    liquid    instruments    with    original    maturities    of    three    months    or    less   when    acquired,    to    be    cash    equivalents.  We    had    no    cash    equivalents    at    September    30,    2016    or    March    31,   2016.   INCOME TAXES   The  Company    accounts  for  income  taxes  under  the  provisions  issued  by  the  FASB  which  requires   recognition    of    deferred    tax    liabilities    and    assets    for    the    expected    future    tax    consequences    of    events    that   have    been    included    in    the    financial    statements    or    tax    returns.    Under    this    method,    deferred    tax    liabilities   and    assets    are    determined    based    on    the    difference    between    the    financial    statement and    tax bases    of    assets   and    liabilities    using    enacted    tax    rates    in    effect    for    the    year    in    which    the    differences    are    expected    to   reverse.    The    Company computes tax asset    benefits    for    net    operating losses    carried forward.    The    potential   benefit of net operating losses has not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company   cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future   years.   LOSS PER COMMON SHARE   The    Company    reports    net    loss    per    share    in    accordance    with    provisions    of    the    FASB.  The    provisions   require    dual    presentation    of basic    and    diluted    loss    per    share.    Basic    net    loss    per    share    excludes    the    impact   of common    stock equivalents.    Diluted    net    loss    per    share    utilizes    the    average    market    price    per    share    when   applying the treasury stock method in determining common    stock equivalents. As of September 30, 2016,   and March 31, 2016, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Pursuant    to    ASC    No.    820,   Fair    Value    Measurements    and    Disclosures ,    the    Company    is    required    to   estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.   The Company s financial instruments consist of cash.  The Company considers the carrying value of such   amounts    in    the    financial    statements    to    approximate    their    fair    value    due    to    the    short-term    nature    of    these   financial instruments.   9           UA GRANITE CORPORATION     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (Unaudited)    NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    Continued   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    New accounting standard updates   not adopted yet    In    February    2016,  the    Financial    Accounting    Standards    Board    (FASB)    issued    Accounting    Standards   Update    2016-02,       Leases        (Topic        842).     The    standard    requires    the    recognition    of    lease    assets    and    lease   liabilities    by    lessees    for    those    leases    classified    as    operating    leases.    Leases    will    be    classified    as    either   finance  or  operating,  with  classification  affecting  the  pattern  of  expense  recognition.  The  standard   requires    lessors    to    classify    leases    as    either    sales-type,    finance    or    operating.    A    sales-type    lease    occurs    if   the    lessor    transfers    all    of    the    risks    and    rewards,    as    well    as    control    of    the    underlying    asset,    to    the    lessee.   If    risks    and    rewards    are    conveyed    without    the    transfer    of    control,    the    lease    is    treated    as    a    financing   lease. If the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. The standard   will    become effective for    the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing   the    impact    adoption    of    this    standard    will    have    on    its    results    of    operations,    financial    condition,    cash   flows, and financial statement disclosures.   In  August  2014,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Accounting  Standards   Updates    (ASU)    2014-15    requiring    an    entity s    management    to    evaluate    whether    there    are    conditions    or   events,    considered in    aggregate,    that    raise    substantial    doubt    about    entity s    ability to continue    as    a    going   concern within one year after the date that the   financial   statements   are issued   (or   within one year after the   date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The amendments to (ASU)   2014-15 are effective for    the annual    period ending after    December    15,    2016,    and for annual    periods and   interim    periods    thereafter.    Early    application    is    permitted.    The    Company    is    in    the    process    of    evaluating   the prospective impact that (ASU) 2014-15 will have on its balance   sheet.    New accounting standard updates - adopted    In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Updates   (ASU)    2015-03    which    requires    that    debt    issuance    costs    be    reported    in    the    balance    sheet    as    a    direct   deduction     from  the     face  amount     of     the     related     liability,     consistent     with     the     presentation     of     debt   discounts.    Prior    to    the    amendments,    debt    issuance    costs    were    presented    as    a    deferred    charge    (i.e.,    an   asset)    on    the    balance    sheet.    The    ASU    provides    examples    illustrating    the    balance    sheet    presentation    of   notes  net  of  their  related  discounts  and  debt  issuance  costs.  Further,  the  amendments  require  the   amortization of debt issuance costs to be reported as interest    expense.    Similarly,    debt issuance costs and   any discount    or    premium    is    considered    in    the    aggregate    when    determining    the    effective    interest    rate    on   the    debt.    The    amendments    are    effective    for    public    business    entities    for    fiscal    years    beginning    after   December    15,    2015,    and    interim    periods    within    those    fiscal    years.    The    application    of    this    ASU    did    not   result in the reclassification of debt issuance cost and related amortization.   10           UA GRANITE CORPORATION     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (Unaudited)    NOTE 3 -INCOME TAXES    Deferred  income     taxes     arise     from  temporary  differences     resulting     from     income     and     expense     items   reported    for    financial    accounting    and    tax    purposes    in    different    periods.    Deferred    taxes    are    classified    as   current  or  non-current,  depending    on  the  classification  of  assets    and  liabilities  to  which    they    relate.   Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified   as    current    or    non-current    depending    on    the    periods    in    which    the    temporary    differences    are    expected    to   reverse.

ASC    820-10    relates   to financial assets and financial liabilities.   ASC    820-10 defines    fair    value,    establishes a    framework for    measuring fair    value    in    accounting principles   generally    accepted    in    the    United    States    of    America    (GAAP),    and    expands    disclosures    about    fair    value   measurements.    The    provisions    of    this    standard    apply to    other    accounting    pronouncements    that    require    or   permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions.   ASC    820-10    defines    fair    value    as    the    price    that    would    be    received    to    sell    an    asset    or    paid    to    transfer    a   liability    in    an    orderly    transaction    between    market    participants    at    the    measurement    date.    This    standard    is   now the single source in GAAP for the definition of fair value, except for the fair value of leased property   as     defined  in     SFAS     13.  ASC     820-10  establishes  a  fair     value     hierarchy  that  distinguishes     between   (1) market    participant    assumptions    developed    based    on    market    data    obtained    from    independent    sources   (observable    inputs)    and    (2) an    entity s    own    assumptions,    about    market    participant    assumptions,    that    are   developed    based    on    the    best    information    available    in    the    circumstances    (unobservable    inputs).    The    fair   value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices   in active markets    for    identical    assets or    liabilities (Level    1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs   (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820-10 are described below:         Level 1        Unadjusted    quoted    prices    in    active    markets    that    are    accessible    at    the    measurement    date   for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.         Level 2        Inputs    other    than    quoted    prices    included    within    Level    1    that    are    observable    for    the    asset   or    liability,  either    directly    or    indirectly,  including    quoted    prices    for    similar    assets    or   liabilities    in    active    markets;    quoted    prices    for    identical    or    similar    assets    or    liabilities    in   markets    that    are    not    active;    inputs    other    than    quoted    prices    that    are    observable    for    the   asset    or    liability    (e.g.,    interest    rates);    and    inputs    that    are    derived    principally    from    or   corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.         Level 3   Inputs    that    are    both    significant    to    the    fair    value    measurement    and   unobservable.    These   inputs     rely     on     management's     own     assumptions     about     the     assumptions     that     market   participants    would    use    in    pricing    the    asset    or    liability.  (The    unobservable    inputs    are   developed    based    on    the    best    information    available    in    the    circumstances    and    July include   the Company's own data.)   The    following presents the Company's fair value hierarchy for those assets    and liabilities    measured at fair   value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016:   Level 1: None   Level 2: None   Level 3: None   Total Gain (Losses): None   12           UA GRANITE CORPORATION     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (Unaudited)    NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    Our    directors have    advanced    funds to    us    for    our legal, audit,    filing fees,    general    office    administration    and   cash    needs.

This  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and other   parts of this quarterly report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.   Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as  anticipates,   expects,   believes,     plans,   predicts,  and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future   performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-   looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to those   discussed in the subsection entitled  Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future     Results and Financial Condition  below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our   financial statements and notes thereto included in this report. Our fiscal year end is March 31. All   information presented herein is based on the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, and   September 30, 2015.    Overview    The Company is currently in the process of evaluating business opportunities and has minimal operating   levels. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in identifying suitable business   opportunities, or if we are able to identify suitable business opportunities, that we will be able to find an   adequate source of financing to acquire any business or business assets, and commence operations, or that   those operations, if commenced, will be successful in generating profits.    Our Plan of Operation    The Company s plan of operation over the next twelve months is to identify and acquire a suitable   business opportunity. However, we will not be able to pursue any new business opportunities that we   might identify without additional financing to provide for ongoing operations. Management is actively   seeking new financing to this end while we evaluate potential businesses.   We anticipate that in order to maintain operations while we evaluate new businesses the Company will   need debt or equity funding of at least $50,000 over the next twelve months. Should we be successful in   identifying a new business opportunity the Company will require additional funding to evaluate and   prospectively acquire any given opportunity. The amount of such additional funding will depend on the   business and is not determinable at this time.   Other than shareholder loans, we do not believe that debt financing will be an attractive means of funding   our business development as we do not have tangible assets to secure debt financing. Rather, we   anticipate that future funding will be in the form of shareholder loans and equity financing from the sale   of our common stock. However, we do not currently have any financing arrangements in place and cannot   provide prospective investors with any assurance that we will be able to procure sufficient funding to fund   our plan of operation. Accordingly, we will require continued financial support from our shareholders and   creditors until we are able to generate sufficient net cash flow from active operations on a sustained basis.    Results of Operations    During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company (i) sought out prospective   business opportunities; and (ii) satisfied continuous public disclosure requirements.   14        
    Our operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below.     Three months   Six months   Three months   Six months ended     ended   ended   ended   September 30,     September 30,   September 30,   September 30,   2015     2016   2015   2015           Expenses:     Legal and accounting       $   3,594    $   4,216     $   1,160       $   2,660     Consulting   2,400   3,590   6,794   13,863     Administrative   2,102   5,870   120   120     Imputed interest   770   1,537   237   471             Net loss   $   (8,866)    $   (15,213)     $   (8,311)       $   (17,114)     Net Loss     Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $8,866 as compared to net loss of $8,311   for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net losses over the comparable three   month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, can be primarily attributed to an   increase in professional fees, administrative costs, and imputed interest offset by a decrease in consulting   expenses.   Net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2016, was $15,213 as compared to net loss of $17,114   for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net losses over the comparable six month   periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, can be primarily attributed to a decrease in   consulting expenses offset by an increase in professional fees, administrative costs, and imputed interest.   We did not generate revenue during this period and expect to continue to incur losses over the next twelve   months at a rate comparable to the current quarterly period presented here or until such time as we are   able to conclude the acquisition or development of a new business opportunity that produces net income.     Capital Expenditures     The Company expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the three and six month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015.     Income Tax Expense (Benefit)     The Company has a prospective income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carry-forward and   start up costs that will offset any future operating profit.     Impact of Inflation     The Company believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past three years.   15        
     Liquidity and Capital Resources    Since inception, the Company has experienced significant changes in liquidity, capital resources, and   stockholders  deficiency.   The Company had current and total assets of $662, consisting solely of cash and a working capital deficit   of $50,243, as of September 30, 2016, as compared to current and total assets of $95, consisting solely of   cash and a working capital deficit of $36,568 as of March 31, 2016. Accumulated deficit was $80,308 at   September 30, 2016, as compared to an accumulated deficit of $65,095 at March 31, 2016.     Cash Used in Operating Activities     Net cash flow used in operating activities for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 was   $12,818 as compared to $4,838 for the six month period ended September 30, 2015, which differences   reflect the comparative changes in working capital in the current period. Net cash flow used in operating   activities in the prior period can also be primarily attributed to changes in working capital and accounts   payable.  Operating activities include but are not limited to, personnel costs, accounting fees and   consulting expenses while changes in working capital include accounts payable and accrued liabilities.   We expect to continue to use net cash flow in operating activities over the next twelve months or until   such time as the Company can generate revenue to offset expenses in order to transition to providing net   cash flow from operations.     Cash Used in Investing Activities     We do expect to use net cash flow in investing activities in connection with the development or   acquisition of a suitable business opportunity in a future period. However, until such time as such   unidentified opportunity is concluded, we do not expect to use net cash flows in investing activities.     Cash Flows from Financing Activities     Cash flow provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016, were $13,385 as   compared to $1,720 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash flow provided   from financing activities over the comparative six month periods can be attributed to unsecured loan   amounts procured from a director and related parties.   We expect to continue to rely on cash flows provided by financing activities to procure sufficient funds to   maintain operations in order to seek out suitable business opportunities.   The Company s current assets are insufficient to conduct its plan of operation over the next twelve (12)   months. We will have to seek at least $50,000 in debt or equity financing over the next twelve months to   maintain operations.  The Company has no current commitments or arrangements with respect to, or   immediate sources of this funding. Further, no assurances can be given that funding is available. The   Company s directors, officers, shareholders and related parties are the most likely source of new funding   in the form of loans or equity though none have made any commitment for future investment and the   Company has no agreement formal or otherwise. The Company s inability to obtain sufficient funding to   maintain operations will have a material adverse affect on its ability to fulfill its current plan of operation.   16          The Company does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   The Company had no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016.   The Company had no commitments for future capital expenditures that were material at September 30,   2016.   The Company has no defined benefit plan or contractual commitment with any of its officers or directors.   The Company has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment.   The Company has no current plans to make any changes in the number of employees.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     As of September 30, 2016, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are   reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial   condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources   that are material to stockholders.     Future Financings     We anticipate continuing to rely on debt or equity sales of our shares of common stock in order to   continue to fund our business operations. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales   of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.     Critical Accounting Policies     In Note 2 to the audited financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, included in   our Form 10-K, the Company discusses those accounting policies that are considered to be significant in   determining the results of operations and its financial position.  The Company believes that the   accounting principles utilized by it conform to US GAAP.   The preparation of financial statements requires Company management to make significant estimates and   judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. By their nature,   these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an on-going basis, the Company   evaluates estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other facts and   circumstances that are believed to be reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments   about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.  The actual results may differ from these estimates under   different assumptions or conditions.     Going Concern     The Company s auditors have expressed an opinion as to the Company s ability to continue as a going   concern as a result of an accumulated deficit of $ 80,308 since inception and negative cash flows from    operating activities  during the period ended September 30, 2016.  The Company s ability to continue as a    going concern is subject to the ability of the Company to obtain funding.  Management s plan to address   the Company s ability to continue as a going concern includes obtaining funding from the private   placement of equity or through debt financing.  Management believes that it will be able to obtain funding   to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, though there can   be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.   17            Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition     The statements contained in the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this current report, with the exception of historical   facts, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and   beliefs regarding our future results of operations, performance, and achievements. These statements are   subject to risks and uncertainties and are based upon assumptions and beliefs that may or may not   materialize. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning:          our anticipated financial performance and business plan;           the sufficiency of existing capital resources;           our ability to raise capital to fund cash requirements for future operations; and           uncertainties related to the Company s future business prospects.    We wish to caution readers that our operating results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that   could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed or anticipated. We also wish to   advise readers not to place any undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this report,   which reflect our beliefs and expectations only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to   update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances or any changes   in our beliefs or expectations, other than as required by law.      ITEM 3.      QUANTITATIVE  AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET     RISK    Not required for smaller reporting companies.      ITEM 4.      CONTROLS  AND PROCEDURES      Disclosure Controls and Procedures     In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the   Company s management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and the acting chief   financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in   Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required   to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,   and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such   information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and   the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by   this report, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective in recording,   processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods   specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and such information was not accumulated and   communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to   allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of   the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are   reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.   18           PART II       Item 1.
