  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
  Cummins Inc. ( Cummins,   we,   our  or  us ) was founded in 1919 as a corporation in Columbus, Indiana, as one of the first diesel engine manufacturers.   We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide.     We serve our customers through a network of approximately     600   company-owned and independent distributor locations and over     7,200     dealer locations in more than   190   countries and territories. 
   
  NOTE 2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
  The unaudited   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations.   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period condensed financial statements. 
  These interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   Consolidated Financial Statements   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Our interim period financial results for the   three and nine month   periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. The year-end   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet   data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. 
  Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts presented and disclosed in our   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  . Significant estimates and assumptions in these   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, determination of discount rates and other assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, warranty programs, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification, contingencies and restructuring costs. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates. 
  Our reporting period usually ends on the Sunday closest to the last day of the quarterly calendar period. The   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   ended on   October 2   and   September 27,   respectively. Our fiscal year ends on December 31, regardless of the day of the week on which December 31 falls. 
  The weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding excludes the anti-dilutive effect of certain stock options since such options had an exercise price in excess of the monthly average market value of our common stock. The options excluded from diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , were as follows: 

In 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase   $500 million   of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase plans and received     4.7 million   shares at an average purchase price of   $105.50   per share.

NOTE 3.  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 
  We sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Contributions to these plans were as follows: 

We anticipate making additional defined benefit pension contributions during the remainder of   2016   of   $22 million   for our U.S. and U.K pension plans. The estimated   $146 million   of pension contributions for the full year include voluntary contributions of approximately   $103 million  . These contributions may be made from trusts or company funds either to increase pension assets or to make direct benefit payments to plan participants. We expect our   2016   net periodic pension cost to approximate   $42 million  . 
  The components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs under our plans were as follows:

NOTE 4.  EQUITY, ROYALTY AND INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTEES    
  Equity, royalty and interest income from investees included in our   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income   for the reporting periods was as follows:  

NOTE 5.  INCOME TAXES    
  Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to approximate   25.5 percent  , excluding any one-time items that may arise. Our tax rate is generally less than the   35 percent   U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to lower tax rates on foreign income and the research tax credit.    
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended October 2, 2016  , was   21.5 percent   and   25.5 percent  , respectively. 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended September 27, 2015  , was   30.1 percent   and   28.7 percent  , respectively. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2015, included an   $18 million   discrete tax benefit to reflect the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions related to a favorable federal audit settlement.    
  The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016, versus the comparable periods in 2015 was primarily due to favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income. 
  It is reasonably possible that our existing liabilities for uncertain tax benefits may decrease in an amount ranging from   $20 million   to   $26 million   within the next 12 months for U.S. and non-U.S. audits that are in progress.     
   
  NOTE 6.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
  A summary of marketable securities, all of which are classified as current, was as follows: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)          The fair value of Level 2 securities is   estimated using actively quoted prices for similar instruments from brokers and observable inputs where available, including market transactions and third-party pricing services, or net asset values provided to investors.   We do not currently have any Level 3 securities and there were no transfers between Level 2 or 3 during the first nine months of 2016 or for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  
   10 

A description of the valuation techniques and inputs used for our Level 2 fair value measures was as follows:    
             
    Bank debentures    These investments provide us with a contractual rate of return and generally range in maturity from     three months   to   one year  . The counter-parties to these investments are reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Since these instruments are not tradable and must be settled directly by us with the respective financial institution, our fair value measure is the financial institutions  month-end statement. 
                
    Debt mutual funds    The fair value measure for these investments is the daily net asset value published on a regulated governmental website. Daily quoted prices are available from the issuing brokerage and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input. 
                
    Equity mutual funds    The fair value measure for these investments is the net asset value published by the issuing brokerage. Daily quoted prices are available from reputable third party pricing services and are used on a test basis to corroborate this Level 2 input measure.    
                
    Government debt securities-non-U.S.    The fair value measure for these securities is broker quotes received from reputable firms. These securities are infrequently traded on a national stock exchange and these values are used on a test basis to corroborate our Level 2 input measure.    
     The proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and gross realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities were as follows: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)      Gross realized losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities were immaterial. 
  At   October 2, 2016  , the fair value of available-for-sale investments in debt securities that utilize a Level 2 fair value measure is shown by contractual maturity below:

NOTE 8.  DEBT    
  Loans Payable and Commercial Paper 
  Loans payable, commercial paper and the related weighted-average interest rates were as follows: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)           Loans payable consist primarily of notes payable to various domestic and international financial institutions. It is not practical to aggregate these notes and calculate a quarterly weighted-average interest rate.    
   (2)       In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $1.75 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper") pursuant to a commercial paper program. The program will facilitate the private placement of unsecured short-term debt through third party brokers. We intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes.    
   (3)       The weighted average interest rate is inclusive of all brokerage fees.    
  Long-term Debt 
  A summary of long-term debt was as follows:    

Principal payments required on long-term debt during the next five years are as follows:    

Fair Value of Debt    
  Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities, considering our risk premium, the fair value and carrying value of total debt, including current maturities, was as follows: 

_________________________________________________ 
   (1)      The fair value of debt is derived from Level 2 inputs.

NOTE 10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.    
  We conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances.    
  Loss Contingency 
  Engine systems sold in the U.S. must be certified to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) emission standards. EPA and CARB regulations require that in-use testing be performed on vehicles by the emission certificate holder and reported to the EPA and CARB in order to ensure ongoing compliance with these emission standards. We are the holder of this emission certificate for our engines, including engines installed in certain vehicles with one customer on which we did not also manufacture or sell the emission aftertreatment system. During 2015, a  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

quality issue in certain of these third party aftertreatment systems caused some of our inter-related engines to fail in-use emission testing. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the vehicle manufacturer made a request that we assist in the design and bear the financial cost of a field campaign (Campaign) to address the technical issue purportedly causing some vehicles to fail the in-use testing. 
  While we are not responsible for the warranty issues related to a component that we did not manufacture or sell, as the emission compliance certificate holder, we are responsible for proposing a remedy to the EPA and CARB. As a result, we have proposed actions to the agencies that we believe will address the emission failures. As the certificate holder, we expect to participate in the cost of the proposed voluntary Campaign and recorded a charge of     $60 million   in 2015.   The Campaign design was finalized with our OEM customer, reviewed with the EPA and submitted for final approval in the second quarter of 2016, and we recorded an additional accrual of   $39 million  . We have concluded based upon additional in-use emission testing performed in the third quarter of 2016, that the Campaign should be expanded to include a larger population of vehicles manufactured by this one OEM. As a result, we recorded an additional accrual of   $99 million   in the third quarter to reflect the estimated cost of our participation in the expanded Campaign. We continue to work with our OEM customer to resolve the allocation of costs for the Campaign, including pending litigation between the parties. The Campaign is not expected to be completed for some time and our final cost could differ from the amount we have recorded. 
  We do not currently expect any fines or penalties from the EPA or CARB related to this matter.  The accrual related to the Campaign is included in "Other accrued expenses" in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.    
  Guarantees and Commitments    
  From time to time we enter into guarantee arrangements, including guarantees of non-U.S. distributor financings, residual value guarantees on equipment under operating leases and other miscellaneous guarantees of joint ventures or third-party obligations. At October 2, 2016, the maximum potential loss related to these guarantees   was   $24 million  . 
  We have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. At October 2, 2016, if we were to stop purchasing from each of these suppliers, the aggregate amount of the penalty would be approximately   $108 million  ,   of which     $55 million     relates to a contract with a components supplier that extends to 2018. Most of these arrangements enable us to secure critical components. We do not currently anticipate paying any penalties under these contracts. 
  We enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum, palladium and copper to purchase minimum volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods, not to exceed     two   years. At October 2, 2016, the total commitments under these contracts were   $27 million  . These arrangements enable us to fix the prices of these commodities, which otherwise are subject to market volatility. 
  We have guarantees with certain customers that require us to satisfactorily honor contractual or regulatory obligations, or compensate for monetary losses related to nonperformance. These performance bonds and other performance-related guarantees were     $79 million   at   October 2, 2016  . 
  Indemnifications    
  Periodically, we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third-party against certain types of losses. Common types of indemnities include:    
             
    product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications;    
                
    asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the asset sold; and    
                
    any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract. 
     We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnifications are not related to specified known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications.

  NOTE 12.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER CHARGES    
  We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2015. These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2015, as well as expected reductions in orders in most U.S. and global markets in 2016. We reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately   1,900     employees  , including approximately   370   employees accepting voluntary retirement packages with the remainder of the reductions being involuntary.   We incurred a charge of   $90 million   in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which   $86 million   related to severance costs for both voluntary and involuntary terminations and   $4 million   for asset impairments and other charges. 
  Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring costs and benefits were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates. 
  Restructuring actions and other charges were included in each segment in our operating results as follows: 

____________________________________________________ 
   (1)    Restructuring actions and other charges by segment were re-allocated in conjunction with our segment realignment. See Note   13  , "  OPERATING SEGMENTS  ," for additional information.

At October 2, 2016  , substantially all terminations have been completed  . 
  The table below summarizes the activity and balance of accrued workforce reductions, which is included in "Other accrued expenses" in our   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  : 

NOTE 13.  OPERATING SEGMENTS 
  Operating segments under GAAP are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Operating Officer.    
  We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the CODM to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments.    
  As previously announced, beginning with the second quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how the CODM monitors the performance of our segments. We reorganized our business to combine our Power Generation segment and our high-horsepower engine business to create the new Power Systems segment. Our reportable operating segments consist of Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Systems. We began to report results for our new reporting structure in the second quarter of 2016 and also reflected this change for historical periods.     
  We allocate certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. In addition to the reorganization noted above, we reevaluated the allocation of these costs, considering the new segment structure created in April 2016 and adjusted our allocation methodology accordingly. The revised methodology, which is based on a combination of relative segment sales and relative service usage levels, is effective for the periods beginning after January 1, 2016 and resulted in the revision of our segment operating results, including segment EBIT, for all four segments for the first quarter of 2016 with a greater share of costs allocated to the Distribution and Components segments than in previous years. Prior periods were not revised for the new allocation methodology. These changes had no impact on our consolidated results.    
  Our new reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  . The Engine segment produces engines (15 liters and less in size) and associated parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various off-highway markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, agriculture, power generation systems and other off-highway applications. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Systems segment is an integrated power provider, which designs, manufactures and sells engines (16 liters and larger) for industrial applications (including mining, oil and gas and marine), standby and prime power generator sets, alternators and other power components. 
  The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  .   We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. As noted above, we allocate certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments. We do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance or income taxes to individual segments.   Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Summarized financial information regarding our reportable operating segments for the three and nine month periods is shown in the table below: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)     Includes intersegment sales, intersegment profit in inventory eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses. There were no significant unallocated corporate expenses for the three and nine months ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  . 
   (2)     Depreciation and amortization as shown on a segment basis excludes the amortization of debt discount and deferred costs included in the     Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income   as "Interest expense."     The amortization of debt discount and deferred costs was $2 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015.

NOTE 14.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our   Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.    
  In June 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. This amendment introduces new guidance for accounting for credit losses on instruments including trade receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. The new rules are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our   Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the accounting for stock compensation. This amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions that could impact us including, but not limited to, recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the income statement each period and classification of the excess tax benefits or deficiencies as operating activities in the cash flow statement. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our   Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the accounting for leases. Under the new standard, lessees will now be required to recognize substantially all leases on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use-asset and a liability. The standard will continue to have two types of leases for income statement recognition purposes: operating leases and finance leases. Operating leases will result in the recognition of a single lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term similar to the treatment for operating leases under today's standards. Finance leases will result in an accelerated expense similar to the accounting for capital leases under today's standards. The determination of a lease classification as operating or finance will be done in a manner very similar to today's standard. The new standard also contains amended guidance regarding the identification of embedded leases in service contracts and the identification of lease and non-lease components in an arrangement. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are still evaluating the impact the standard could have on our   Consolidated Financial Statements  ; however, while we have not yet quantified the amount, we do expect the standard will have a material impact on our   Consolidated Balance Sheets   due to the recognition of additional assets and liabilities for operating leases.    
  In January 2016, the FASB amended its standards related to the accounting for certain financial instruments. This amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our   Consolidated Financial Statements  . 
  In May 2014, the FASB amended its standards related to revenue recognition. This amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

of certain contract costs, consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in those judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. The standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption effective for annual and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our   Consolidated Financial Statements.     We expect to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach. While we have not yet completed our evaluation process, we have identified transactions where revenue recognition is currently limited to the amount of billings not contingent on our future performance. With the allocation provisions of the new model, we expect to accelerate the timing of revenue recognition for amounts related to satisfied performance obligations that would have been delayed under the current guidance. We do not expect the impact of this change to be material, but we are still quantifying the impact. 
   
  NOTE 15.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
  Acquisition of Cummins Pacific, LLC 
  In October 2016, we acquired the remaining   50 percent   interest in Cummins Pacific, LLC from the former distributor principal. The purchase consideration was   $97 million  , which included   $17 million   in cash and an additional   $66 million   paid to eliminate outstanding debt. The remaining   $14 million   will be paid in future periods, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We will recognize a gain of   $13 million   on the fair value adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting from this acquisition. 
  This is the final acquisition of the plan we announced on September 17, 2013, to acquire the equity that we did not already own in most of our partially-owned U.S. and Canadian distributors.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
  We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide.     We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Navistar International Corporation, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Volvo AB, Komatsu and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG.     We serve our customers through a network of approximately     600   company-owned and independent distributor locations and over     7,200     dealer locations in more than   190   countries and territories.    
  Our reportable operating segments consist of Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Systems. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  . The Engine segment produces engines (15 liters and less in size) and associated parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various off-highway markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, agriculture, power generation systems and other off-highway applications. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Systems segment is an integrated power provider, which designs, manufactures and sells engines (16 liters and larger) for industrial applications (including mining, oil and gas and marine), standby and prime power generator sets, alternators and other power components.    
  Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels, production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.    
  Worldwide revenues   decreased     9 percent   in the three months ended   October 2, 2016,   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to lower demand in most global on-highway markets, decreased demand in most global power generation markets, lower demand in most distribution markets and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by sales increases related to the consolidation of North American distributors since December 31, 2014. Revenue in the U.S. and Canada   declined   by   13 percent   primarily due to decreased demand in the North American on-highway markets, partially offset by increased Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of North American distributors. Continued global economic weakness in the   third   quarter of 2016 negatively impacted our international revenues (excludes the U.S. and Canada), which   declined   by   3 percent  , with sales down in many of our markets, especially in Africa, Korea, Mexico and Middle East. The decline in international sales was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts of   3 percent   of international sales (primarily in the   British pound and Chinese renminbi  ) and lower demand in the power generation markets, especially in Middle East and Asia (excluding China).  
  Worldwide revenues declined 9 percent in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015,   primarily due to lower demand in most global on-highway markets, decreased demand in most global power generation markets, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower demand in most global high-horsepower industrial markets, partially offset by sales increases related to the consolidation of North American distributors since December 31, 2014. Revenue in the U.S. and Canada   declined   by   12 percent   primarily due to decreased demand in the North American on-highway markets and lower demand in the industrial oil and gas, construction and mining markets, partially offset by increased Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of North American distributors. Continued global economic weakness in 2016 negatively impacted our international revenues (excludes the U.S. and Canada), which   declined   by   5 percent  , with sales down in most of our markets, especially in South America, Mexico, Middle East and the U.K. The decline in international sales was primarily due to declines in most international power generation markets, unfavorable foreign currency impacts of   4 percent   of international sales (primarily in the   Chinese renminbi, British pound, Brazilian real, Indian rupee, Australian dollar and South African rand  ), lower demand in the on-highway markets in Brazil and Mexico and decreased demand in international high-horsepower industrial markets led by declines in marine and mining.

The following tables contain sales and earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and noncontrolling interests (EBIT) results by operating segment for the three and   nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015  .   Refer to the section titled  Operating Segment Results  for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment, including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before income taxes.

   (1)    Sales and EBIT numbers were adjusted for the segment reorganization. See Note   13  , "  OPERATING SEGMENTS  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  Net income attributable to Cummins was   $289 million  , or   $1.72 per diluted share  , on sales of   $4.2 billion   for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable prior year period net income attributable to Cummins of   $380 million  , or   $2.14   per diluted share, on sales of   $4.6 billion  . The   decrease   in net income and earnings per diluted share was driven by   lower gross margin and an accrual for a loss contingency, partially offset by decreased research, development and engineering expenses, a lower effective tax rate and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses  . The   decrease   in gross margin was primarily due to   lower volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower material and commodity costs  .

   (1)    Sales and EBIT numbers were adjusted for the segment reorganization. See Note   13  , "  OPERATING SEGMENTS  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  Net income attributable to Cummins was $1.0 billion, or $5.99 per diluted share, on sales of $13.0 billion for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, versus the comparable prior year period net income attributable to Cummins of $1.2 billion, or $6.90 per diluted share, on sales of $14.3 billion.   The   decrease   in net income and earnings per diluted share was driven by   lower gross margin and an accrual for a loss contingency, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses, decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and a lower effective tax rate.   The   decrease   in gross margin was primarily due to   lower volumes, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and South African rand), partially offset by lower material and commodity costs, lower warranty expense and improved Distribution segment margins related to the acquisition of North American distributors since December 31, 2014  .   Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, benefited $0.18 from fewer weighted average shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase programs. 
  We generated   $1.3 billion   of operating cash flows for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared to   $1.1 billion   for the same period in   2015  . Refer to the section titled "Cash Flows" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.

     Table of Contents  

During the first nine months of 2016, we repurchased   $745 million  , or   7.1 million   shares of common stock, including completion of the accelerated share repurchase agreement finalized in the second quarter of 2016. See Note   2  , "  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  Our debt to capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at   October 2, 2016  , was   21.2 percent  , compared to   17.5 percent   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due to the repurchases of common stock and higher total debt, primarily due to the commercial paper program. At   October 2, 2016  , we had   $1.5 billion   in cash and marketable securities on hand and access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs. 

In July 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5.1 percent from $0.975 per share to $1.025 per share. 
  Our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 111 percent funded at December 31, 2015. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 57 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 119 percent funded and our U.K. plan was 123 percent funded.   We expect to contribute   $146 million   to our U.S. and U.K. pension plans and   $44 million   to our German pension plans in   2016  . In addition, we expect our   2016   net periodic pension cost to approximate   $42 million  . See Note   3  , "  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an additional accrual of   $99 million   for an existing loss contingency. For the nine months ended October 2, 2016, we accrued a total of   $138 million   related to this matter. See Note   10  , "  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
  We expect our effective tax rate for the full year of   2016   to approximate   25.5 percent  , excluding any one-time tax items. 
  In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in the final previously unconsolidated North American distributor for   $97 million   and will recognize a gain of   $13 million   in the fourth quarter on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition.

OUTLOOK 
  Our outlook reflects the following trends for the remainder of   2016  : 
             
    We expect demand for pick-up trucks in North America to remain strong. 
                
    We intend to realize annualized savings from the 2015 restructuring actions of approximately $160 million. 
     Our outlook reflects the following challenges to our business that may reduce our revenue and earnings potential for the remainder of   2016  : 
             
    We expect industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to decline. 
                
    We expect power generation markets to remain weak. 
                
    We expect industry production of medium-duty trucks in North America to decline. 
                
    We expect North American construction markets to weaken. 
                
    We believe weak economic conditions in Brazil will continue to negatively impact demand across our businesses. 
                
    Foreign currency volatility could continue to put pressure on our revenues and earnings.  
                
    We expect market demand to remain weak in the oil and gas and commercial marine markets as the result of low crude oil prices. 
                
    We expect demand for equipment in global mining markets to remain weak. 
                
    We could close or restructure additional manufacturing facilities as we evaluate the appropriate size and structure of our manufacturing capacity, which could result in additional charges.

Net Sales 
  Net sales for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  ,   decreased   by   $433 million     versus the comparable period in   2015  . The primary drivers were as follows: 
             
    Engine segment sales   decrease  d   12 percent   primarily due to lower demand in North American on-highway markets and lower demand in most North American off-highway markets, partially offset by increased sales in the light-duty automotive market. 
                
    Power Systems segment sales   decrease  d   13 percent   primarily due to lower demand in all reporting structures and decreased sales in most regions with the largest declines in Asia (excluding China), Middle East, North America and Africa. 
                
    Components segment sales   decrease  d   8 percent   primarily due to lower demand in most lines of businesses, primarily in North American on-highway markets, partially offset by higher demand in China. 
                
    Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by approximately   2 percent   primarily in the   British pound and Chinese renminbi  . 
                
    Distribution segment sales   decrease  d   3 percent  , primarily due to a decline in organic sales in engine markets, partially offset by higher sales related to the acquisition of North American distributors since December 31, 2014.

Net sales for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  ,   decrease  d by   $1.3 billion     versus the comparable period in   2015  . The primary drivers were as follows: 
             
    Engine segment sales   decrease  d   11 percent   primarily due to lower demand in North American on-highway markets and lower demand in most global off-highway markets, partially offset by increased sales in the light-duty automotive market. 
                
    Power Systems segment sales   decrease  d   16 percent   primarily due to lower demand in all reporting structures and decreased sales in most regions with the largest declines in North America, China, Asia, Middle East, Africa, Western Europe and Mexico, partially offset by increased sales in Russia. 
                
    Components segment sales   decrease  d   7 percent   primarily due to lower demand in all lines of business, mostly in North American on-highway markets, partially offset by higher demand in China. 
                
    Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by approximately   2 percent   primarily in the   Chinese renminbi, British pound, Brazilian real, Indian rupee, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and South African rand  . 
     Sales to international markets, based on location of customers, for both the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016, were 41 percent of total net sales compared with 38 percent and 39 percent of total net sales, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the  OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS  section. 
  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin   decrease  d   $129 million   for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , and   decreased     0.3 point  s as a percentage of sales. The   decrease   in gross margin dollars was primarily due to   lower volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower material and commodity costs  . 
  Gross margin decreased $403 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, versus the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 0.4 points as a percentage of sales  . The   decrease   in gross margin dollars was primarily due to   lower volumes, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and South African rand), partially offset by lower material and commodity costs, lower warranty expense and improved Distribution segment margins related to the acquisition of North American distributors since December 31, 2014  . 
  The provision for base warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percent of sales for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016, was 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, compared to 1.8 percent and 2.0 percent for the comparable periods in 2015.   A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the  OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS  section. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased     $17 million   for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to lower compensation expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by higher consulting expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,   increased   to   12.3 percent   in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , from   11.5 percent   in the comparable period in   2015  . 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $57 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, versus the comparable period in 2015  , primarily due to lower compensation expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower consulting expenses. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,   increased   to   11.7 percent   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , from   11.0 percent   in the comparable period in   2015  . 
  Research, Development and Engineering Expenses  
  Research, development and engineering expenses   decreased     $40 million   for the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to lower consulting expenses, decreased compensation expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, and increased expense recovery from customers and external parties. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales,   decreased   to   3.7 percent   in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , from   4.3 percent   in the comparable period in   2015  .

  Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. 
  Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees 
  Equity, royalty and interest income from investees   decrease  d   $4 million   for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to the impact of an asset impairment incurred by one of our Power Systems joint ventures ($8 million), partially offset by increased earnings at Chongqing Engine Company, Ltd. 
    
  Equity, royalty and interest income from investees   decrease  d   $6 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to lower earnings from North American distributors ($9 million), the impact of an asset impairment incurred by one of our Power Systems joint ventures ($8 million) and decreased earnings at Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. ($8 million). These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. ($12 million). 

Loss Contingency 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded an additional accrual of   $99 million   for an existing loss contingency. For the nine months ended October 2, 2016, we accrued a total of   $138 million   related to this matter. See Note   10  , "  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information. 
    
  Other Operating Expense, Net 
  Other operating expense, net   was as follows: 

Interest Income 
  Interest income for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016,   decreased     $3 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015 primarily due to interest earned on a favorable tax settlement in Brazil in 2015. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the three months ended October 2, 2016, remained flat versus the comparable period in 2015.  
  Interest expense for the nine months ended October 2, 2016,   increased     $4 million   versus the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in total weighted average debt outstanding.

Other Income, Net 
  Other income, net   was as follows: 

Income Tax Expense 
  Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to approximate   25.5 percent  , excluding any one-time items that may arise. Our tax rate is generally less than the   35 percent   U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily due to lower tax rates on foreign income and the research tax credit.    
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended October 2, 2016  , was   21.5 percent   and   25.5 percent  , respectively. 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended September 27, 2015  , was   30.1 percent   and   28.7 percent  , respectively. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2015, included an   $18 million   discrete tax benefit to reflect the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions related to a favorable federal audit settlement. 
  The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016, versus the comparable periods in 2015 was primarily due to favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income.    
  It is reasonably possible that our existing liabilities for uncertain tax benefits may decrease in an amount ranging from   $20 million   to   $26 million   within the next 12 months for U.S. and non-U.S. audits that are in progress.     
  Noncontrolling Interests 
  Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , remained relatively flat versus the comparable period in 2015. 
  Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $10 million   primarily due to lower earnings as a result of the consolidation of North American distributors since December 31, 2014 and lower earnings at Cummins India Ltd. 
  Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. 
  Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $91 million   and   $0.42   per share, respectively versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to   lower gross margin and an accrual for a loss contingency, partially offset by decreased research, development and engineering expenses, a lower effective tax rate and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses  .        
  Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $222 million   and   $0.91   per share, respectively versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to   lower gross margin and an accrual for a loss contingency, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses, decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and a lower effective tax rate.      Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, benefited $0.18 from fewer weighted average shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase programs.

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS 
  Our reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. We use segment EBIT as the primary basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. 
  As previously announced, beginning with the second quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how the CODM monitors the performance of our segments. We reorganized our business to combine our Power Generation segment and our high-horsepower engine business to create the new Power Systems segment. Our reportable operating segments consist of Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Systems. We began to report results for our new reporting structure in the second quarter of 2016 and also reflected this change for historical periods.   The formation of the Power Systems segment combined two businesses that were already strongly interdependent, which will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation, grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations.    
  We allocate certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. In addition to the reorganization noted above, we reevaluated the allocation of these costs, considering the new segment structure created in April 2016 and adjusted our allocation methodology accordingly. The revised methodology, which is based on a combination of relative segment sales and relative service usage levels, is effective for the periods beginning after January 1, 2016 and resulted in the revision of our segment operating results, including segment EBIT, for all four segments for the first quarter of 2016 with a greater share of costs allocated to the Distribution and Components segments than in previous years. Prior periods were not revised for the new allocation methodology. These changes had no impact on our consolidated results.    
  Following is a discussion of results for each of our operating segments. 
   
  Engine Segment Results 
  Financial data for the Engine segment was as follows:

Sales 
  Engine segment sales for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $243 million   versus the comparable period in   2015  . The following were the primary drivers: 
             
    Heavy-duty truck engine sales   decrease  d   $159 million   primarily due to lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market with decreased engine shipments of 36 percent. 
                
    Medium-duty truck and bus sales   decrease  d   $68 million   primarily due to lower demand in global medium-duty truck markets with decreased engine shipments of 18 percent, primarily in North America, Western Europe and Latin America (excluding Brazil). 
                
    Off-highway sales   decrease  d   $22 million   primarily due to decreased engine shipments to most industrial markets in North America, partially offset by increased unit shipments of 22 percent in international construction markets. 
     The decreases above were partially offset by an   increase   in light-duty automotive sales of   $6 million   primarily due to new sales for the Nissan pick-up truck platform launched in the second half of 2015. 
  Total on-highway-related sales for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , were   80 percent   of total engine segment sales, compared to   81 percent   for the comparable period in   2015  .  
  Engine segment sales for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, decreased $735 million versus the comparable period in 2015.   The following were the primary drivers: 
             
    Heavy-duty truck engine sales   decrease  d   $538 million   primarily due to lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market with decreased engine shipments of 39 percent.

    Off-highway sales   decrease  d   $94 million   primarily due to decreased engine shipments in most North American industrial markets, partially offset by increased unit shipments of 21 percent in international construction markets. 
     The decreases above were partially offset by an   increase   in light-duty automotive sales of   $98 million   primarily due to new sales for the Nissan pick-up truck platform launched in the second half of 2015. 
  Total on-highway-related sales for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, were 81 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 82 percent for the comparable period in 2015. 
  Segment EBIT 
  Engine segment EBIT for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  ,   decrease  d   $128 million   versus the comparable period in   2015   primarily due to an additional accrual for a loss contingency and lower gross margin, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. 
  Engine segment EBIT for the nine months ended October 2, 2016, decreased $203 million versus the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to   lower gross margin and an additional accrual for a loss contingency, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower research, development and engineering expenses and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows:

  The   decrease   in gross margin dollars for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower material and commodity costs and favorable product coverage. The   decrease   in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower compensation expenses as the result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower consulting expenses. The   decrease   in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower compensation expenses as the result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Key Working Capital and Balance Sheet Data 
  We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.   Working capital and balance sheet measures are provided in the following table: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)         Working capital includes cash and cash equivalents. 
   (2)         The increase in our debt to capital ratio was due to the repurchases of common stock and higher total debt, primarily due to the commercial paper program.  
  Cash Flows 
  Cash and cash equivalents were impacted as follows: 

Net cash   provided by   operating activities   increase  d   $179 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to lower working capital levels and an increase in deferred income taxes, partially offset by lower consolidated net income, decreases from translation and hedging activities and restructuring payments. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the   lower   working capital requirements resulted in a cash   outflow   of   $306 million   compared to a cash   outflow   of   $414 million   in the comparable period in   2015  .  
  Net cash   used in   investing activities   increase  d   $113 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to higher net investments in marketable securities of $209 million and decreased cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of $81 million, partially offset by lower acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired of $101 million and lower capital expenditures of $81 million. 
  Net cash   used in   financing activities   decrease  d   $174 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , primarily due to higher net borrowings of commercial paper of $273 million, increased proceeds from borrowings of $87 million and higher net borrowings under short term credit agreements of $63 million, partially offset by higher common stock repurchases of $95 million, higher payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations of $92 million and higher dividend payments of $53 million. 
  The effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , versus the comparable period in   2015  , decreased   $87 million   primarily due to the British pound, which decreased cash and cash equivalents by $91 million.

Sources of Liquidity  
  We generate significant ongoing cash flow. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with   $1.3 billion   provided in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  . 
  At   October 2, 2016  , our other sources of liquidity included: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)     The majority of marketable securities could be liquidated into cash within a few days. 
   (2)     The revolving credit facility is maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. At October 2, 2016, we had   $273 million   of commercial paper outstanding, which effectively reduced the available capacity under our revolving credit facility to   $1.48 billion  . 
   (3)    The available capacity is net of letters of credit. 
  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
  A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S.   The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our ongoing investments. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources.    
  If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes, for example, if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the U.S. consist primarily of earnings of our China and U.K. domiciled subsidiaries. At present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. Earnings generated after 2011 from our China operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years. 
  Debt Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity 
  In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $1.75 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper") pursuant to a commercial paper program. The program will facilitate the private placement of unsecured short-term debt through third party brokers. We intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. 
  We have a   $1.75 billion   revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which can be used for general corporate purposes. This facility expires on November 13, 2020. The revolving credit facility is maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and general corporate purposes. The total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program should not exceed $1.75 billion. 
  As a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2016. Under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units.

Uses of Cash 
  Share Repurchases 
  In November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2014 repurchase plan.   In the first nine months of   2016  , we made the following purchases under the respective stock repurchase programs: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)      The remaining authorized capacities under the 2014 and 2015 Plans were calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares but exclude commission expenses in accordance with the authorized Plans. 
   (2)    Upon completion of the ASR in the second quarter of 2016, the shares purchased and average cost per share were updated based on the final valuation. 
  In 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase   $500 million   of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase plans and received     4.7 million   shares at an average purchase price of   $105.50   per share. 
  We may continue to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time   during 2016   to enhance shareholder value and to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans. 
  Dividends 
  In July 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5.1 percent from $0.975 per share to $1.025 per share.   We paid dividends of   $505 million   during the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  . 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Capital expenditures and spending on internal use software for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , were   $354 million   compared to   $431 million   in the comparable period in   2015  .   Despite the challenging conditions in many of our markets, we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. We plan to spend between $550 million and $600 million in 2016 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements. Approximately 40 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the U.S. in 2016. 
  Pensions 
  Our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 111 percent funded at December 31, 2015. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 57 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 119 percent funded and our U.K. plan was 123 percent funded.     The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans.   In the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   the investment return on our U.S. pension trust was 11.7 percent while our U.K. pension trust return was 22.0 percent.     Approximately 79 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities. The remaining 21 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts.   We anticipate making additional defined benefit pension contributions during the remainder of   2016   of   $22 million   for our U.S. and U.K pension plans and   $44 million   (  $27 million   of which will be cash) for our German pension plans. The estimated   $146 million   of U.S. and U.K. pension contributions for the full year include voluntary contributions of approximately   $103 million  . The   $44 million   contribution to the German plans is voluntary. These contributions may be made from trusts or company funds either to increase pension assets  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

or to make direct benefit payments to plan participants. We expect our   2016   net periodic pension cost to approximate   $42 million  . 
  Current Maturities of Short and Long-Term Debt 
  We had   $273 million   of commercial paper outstanding at   October 2, 2016,   that matures in less than one year. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from   $7 million   to   $31 million   over the next five years (including the remainder of 2016). 
  Restructuring Actions 
  We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2015. We reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately   1,900   employees. We incurred a fourth quarter charge of   $90 million   (  $61 million   after tax) for these headcount reductions, with   $86 million   expected to be settled in cash, of which $60 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2015. In 2016, we paid   $53 million   (with approximately $7 million remaining) of restructuring payments and as of October 2, 2016 substantially all terminations were complete. See Note   12  , "  RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER CHARGES  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information.

In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    
  Management's Assessment of Liquidity 
  Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable ready access to credit and the capital markets. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, capital expenditures, dividend payments, projected pension obligations and debt service obligations. We continue to generate cash from operations in the U.S. and maintain access to our revolving credit facility.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,  of the   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements   of our   2015   Form 10-K, which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. 
  Our   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that often require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our critical accounting estimates disclosed in the Form 10-K address the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits. 
  A discussion of our critical accounting estimates may be found in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis  section of our   2015   Form 10-K under the caption  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.  Within the context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different policies or estimates being reported in the first   nine   months of   2016  .

  ITEM 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
  A discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk may be found in Item 7A of our   2015   Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in this information since the filing of our   2015   Form 10-K.  
   
  ITEM 4.      Controls and Procedures    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   October 2, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1.      Legal Proceedings 
  We are subject to numerous lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including actions related to product liability; personal injury; the use and performance of our products; warranty matters; patent, trademark or other intellectual property infringement; contractual liability; the conduct of our business; tax reporting in foreign jurisdictions; distributor termination; workplace safety; and environmental matters. We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party at multiple waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may have joint and several liability for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to such sites. We have denied liability with respect to many of these lawsuits, claims and proceedings and are vigorously defending such lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We carry various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be applicable or adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us with respect to these lawsuits, claims and proceedings. We do not believe that these lawsuits are material individually or in the aggregate. While we believe we have also established adequate accruals for our expected future liability with respect to pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, where the nature and extent of any such liability can be reasonably estimated based upon then presently available information, there can be no assurance that the final resolution of any existing or future lawsuits, claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.    
  The disclosure set forth under "Loss Contingency" in Note   10  , "  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  ," to the   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   is incorporated herein by reference. 
  We conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal, state and local labor, social security, tax and customs laws. While we believe we comply with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances.    
   
  ITEM 1A.      Risk Factors    
  In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should consider other risk factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or the "CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION" in this Quarterly report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently judge to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. 
   
  ITEM 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  The following information is provided pursuant to Item 703 of Regulation S-K: 

____________________________________ 
   (1)       Shares purchased represent shares under our Key Employee Stock Investment Plan established in 1969 (there is no maximum repurchase limitation in this plan) and our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs.    
   (2)       These values reflect the sum of shares held in loan status under our Key Employee Stock Investment Plan. The repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors do not limit the number of shares that may be purchased and were excluded from this column. The dollar value remaining available for future purchases under such programs as of October 2, 2016, was $529 million.    
  In November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2014 repurchase plan.   During the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , we repurchased   $50 million   of common stock under the 2015 Board of Directors authorized plan.

     Table of Contents  

During the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , we repurchased   20,052     shares from employees in connection with the Key Employee Stock Investment Plan which allows certain employees, other than officers, to purchase shares of common stock on an installment basis up to an established credit limit. Loans are issued for five-year terms at a fixed interest rate established at the date of purchase and may be refinanced after its initial five-year period for an additional five-year period. Participants must hold shares for a minimum of six months from date of purchase. If the shares are sold before the loan is paid off, the employee must wait six months before another share purchase may be made. We hold participants  shares as security for the loans and would, in effect repurchase shares if the participant defaulted in repayment of the loan. There is no maximum amount of shares that we may purchase under this plan.

  CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 

___________________________________________________ 
   (1)      The interest amount in the table above does not include interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions.    
   (2)      Amounts represent those portions of rent expense that are reasonable approximations of interest costs. 
   (3)      We have not issued preferred stock. Therefore, the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends are the same as the ratios presented above.
