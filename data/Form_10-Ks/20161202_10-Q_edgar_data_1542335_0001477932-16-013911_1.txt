      Table of Contents            BLACK STALLION OIL   GAS INC     NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)       NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION         Black Stallion Oil   Gas Inc, a Delaware corporation (the  Company ) is an oil and gas exploration company. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had no revenues from its oil and gas operations.      Basis of Presentation    The Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).     These financial statements are presented in US dollars.      Fiscal Year End    The Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.      Unaudited Interim Financial Statements    The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Black Stallion Oil   Gas Inc. have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows, have been included. Management presents the financial instruments without fair value measurement according to ASC 825. Additionally management presents the OIl and Gas leases at contracted price and that the leases are not presented according to ASC 840. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year-end balance sheet data presented for comparative purposes was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other subsequent interim period.      NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Use of Estimates    The preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of unproved oil and gas properties, deferred tax assets, asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency, and energy markets have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.                  F-5       
      Table of Contents           Going concern      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at September 30, 2016 the Company has insufficient working capital, has accumulated losses from operations of $957,501 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016.     To carry out further planned operations, the Company must raise additional funds through additional equity and/or debt issuances. There can be no assurance that this capital will be available, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to curtail or cease exploration and development activities. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      Oil and natural gas properties      The Company follows the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized.     All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in loss from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.     The Company s oil and gas property represents an investment in unproved properties. These costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established. Impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.     Currently, the Company has no economically recoverable reserves and no amortization base. The Company s unproved oil and gas properties consist of capitalized exploration costs of $850,000 as of September 30, 2016.      Limitation on Capitalized Costs      Under the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas properties (the "Ceiling Test"). If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the "Ceiling", this excess or impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization or as a credit to oil and natural gas properties. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: (a) the present value, discounted at 10 percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of 1) estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and natural gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements including hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB 103), less 2) estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized (pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule 4-10 (c)(3)(ii)); plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of (d) the related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties.      Cash and cash equivalents      Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000.                  F-6       
      Table of Contents           Prepaid Expenses      Prepaid contracting expenses represents amounts paid in advance for future contractual benefits to be received. Contracting expenses paid in advance are recorded as a prepaid asset and then amortized to the statements of operations over the life of the contract using the straight-line method.     On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year contracting arrangement with a related party for contracting services related to expertise in the petroleum industry. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $180,000 annually in advance.     On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a 12 month contracting arrangement with a related party. As compensation for services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $2,500 a month, payable $900 in cash and $1,600 with common stock of the company valued at 50% of market at the date of conversion. The contractor was entitled to cash compensation of $25,000 upon signing.     On April 8, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year contracting arrangement with a related party for contracting services related to expertise and experience in raising finance. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $120,000 annually in advance.     On July 15, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year contracting arrangement with a related party for contracting services related to expertise and experience in raising finance. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $120,000 annually in advance.     On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into one year contracting arrangement with an unrelated party for contracting services related to expertise and experience in raising finance. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $50,000 annually in advance.      Intellectual Properties      The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs. All costs incurred during the planning phase of a website are expensed as research and development.     Costs incurred in the development stage, including the purchase of a domain name, are capitalized and reviewed annually for impairment.     Expenses subsequent to the launch will be expensed as research and development expenses. The Company will expense upgrades and revisions to its website as incurred.     Once the website is available for use, the asset will be amortized over its useful life on a straight line basis, estimated to be 3 years, and is tested for impairment annually.      Accounts payable and accrued liabilities      Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.      Earnings per share      Our company computes loss per share in accordance with "ASC-260", "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. In periods of losses, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, as the effect of stock warrants and convertible debt on loss per share is anti-dilutive.     Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of dilutive shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock warrants using the treasury-stock method and convertible debt computed using as-if converted method. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.      Income taxes      Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.                  F-7       
      Table of Contents           Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Management does not anticipate that the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements will materially impact the Company s financial condition.      NOTE 3   WORKING INTEREST IN OIL AND GAS LEASES      On February 23, 2014 the Company entered into a Lease Assignment Agreement with West Bakken Energy Holdings Ltd to acquire from an unaffiliated oil and gas company, an undivided 100% interests (a 50% working interest) in certain oil and gas properties, comprising approximately 12,233,93 acres of land located in Montana, United States.           On October 2, 2015 the Company entered into a Lease Assignment Agreement with Hillcrest Exploration Ltd to acquire from an unaffiliated oil and gas company, the remaining 50% working interest in certain oil and gas properties, comprising approximately 12,233.93 acres of land located in Montana, United States.                 -  As consideration, the Company agreed to issue 500,000 shares of common stock to Hillcrest Exploration Ltd at a purchase price of $1 per share and $50,000 cash for total proceeds of $550,000.                         -  Of the total consideration, $50,000 cash and 250,000 common shares were paid on the date of closing which occurred on October 27, 2015. The remaining 250,000 common shares are contingent and are to be paid on the date that Black Stallion spuds its first oil well on the property. Due to the uncertain nature of oil drilling, management is unable to state that this event is more likely that not to occur. Therefore the total cost capitalized and payable is excluding this amount and will be reassessed at a future date.          NOTE 4   INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET            Intangible assets consist of capitalized website development costs. Development costs of $3,475 relating to website creation, development and launch have been capitalized. The website entered its operating stage during July 2014. Amortization expenses of $1,737 has been expensed during the period ended September 30, 2016.

Our focus for the current fiscal year will be to pursue acquisition of leases and/or existing oil and gas wells which have potential for production, if revenues warrant.                  4

Results of Operations      The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 which are included herein.     Our operating results for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:                        6       
      Table of Contents          For the three months ended September 30, 2016 we had total operating expenses of $172,985 compared to $84,846 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The 184,139 increase in operating expenses during the most recent period was primarily due to increased contactor fees, and increased legal fees resulting from the acceleration of our business and financing activities.      Our operating results for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:           For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had total operating expenses of $365,256 compared to $119,256 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 The increase of $245,739 in operating expenses during the most recent period was primarily due to our incurring $250,330 in contractors fees, and $24,970 in finder s fees.     Since inception on September 14, 2011 until September 30, 2016, we have earned no revenues and incurred a cumulative net loss of $957,501.      Liquidity and Capital Resources       Working Capital                         7       
      Table of Contents           Cash Flows            As September 30, 2016 we had total current assets of $282,561, total and current liabilities of $304,413, and stockholders  equity of $829,885. By comparison, as of December 31, 2015, we had total current assets of $28,842, total and current liabilities of $12,855 and stockholders  equity of $869,462.     We had a working capital deficit of $21,852 as at September 30, 2016 compared to available working capital of $15,987 as at December 31, 2015. The decrease in our working capital as at September 30, 2016 as compared to the period ended December 31, 2015 was due to the ongoing use of cash and accrual of liabilities in our ordinary course of business, which was only partially offset by net cash raised in our financing activities.     Net cash used in our operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $714,390, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $123,523 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     We did not use any net cash in investing activities during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.     Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $723,467, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $130,596 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The difference in the cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was due primarily from our issuance subsequent to September 30, 2015 of 1,100,000 shares of common stock at $0.50 per share for acquisition of 50% working interest in West Bakken Energy Holdings, resulting in deemed paid-in capital of $549,890, as well as our issuance of convertible promissory notes for proceeds of $197,100      Going Concern      We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015 that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.      Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital      There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage corporation and have not generated revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources. To become profitable and competitive, we will need to realize revenue from our oil and gas sales.      Plan of Operation      We are an exploration stage company with no revenues and a short operating history. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we generate sufficient revenues.                  8       
      Table of Contents          There is no assurance we will ever reach that point. In the meantime the continuation of our company is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations.     Our current cash balance as at September 30, 2016 is $9,293. We will therefore require further capital to cover the expenses we will incur during the next twelve months.     We have sold $1,671,382 in equity securities to pay for our start-up operations since inception.     Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to pursue acquisition of leases and/or existing oil and gas wells which have potential for production, if revenues warrant.     Total expenditures over the next 12 months are therefore expected to be approximately $120,000.      Estimated Net Expenditures During the Next Twelve Months            We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed.     The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.     There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. We are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.     We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.      Future Financings      We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.                  9       
      Table of Contents          We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.      Critical Accounting Policies       The principal accounting policies are set out below, these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented, unless otherwise stated:      Use of Estimates      The preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of unproved oil and gas properties, deferred tax assets, asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency, and energy markets have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.      Going concern      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at September 30, 2016 the Company has insufficient working capital, has accumulated losses from operations of $957,501 and has earned no revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016.     To carry out further planned operations, the Company must raise additional funds through additional equity and/or debt issuances. There can be no assurance that this capital will be available, and if it is not, the Company may be forced to curtail or cease exploration and development activities. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      Oil and natural gas properties      The Company follows the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized.     All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves. Investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in loss from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.     The Company s oil and gas property represents an investment in unproved properties. These costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established. Impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.     Currently, the Company has no economically recoverable reserves and no amortization base. The Company s unproved oil and gas properties consist of capitalized exploration costs of $850,000 as of September 30, 2016.             Limitation on Capitalized Costs      Under the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas properties (the "Ceiling Test"). If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the "Ceiling", this excess or impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization or as a credit to oil and natural gas properties. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: (a) the present value, discounted at 10 percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of 1) estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and natural gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements including hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB 103), less 2) estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized (pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule 4-10 (c)(3)(ii)); plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of (d) the related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties.      Cash and cash equivalents      Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000.      Prepaid Expenses      Prepaid contracting expenses represents amounts paid in advance for future contractual benefits to be received. Contracting expenses paid in advance are recorded as a prepaid asset and then amortized to the statements of operations over the life of the contract using the straight-line method.     On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year contracting arrangement with a related party for contracting services related to expertise in the petroleum industry. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $180,000 annually in advance.     On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into a 12 month contracting arrangement with a related party. As compensation for services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $2,500 a month, payable $900 in cash and $1,600 with common stock of the company valued at 50% of market at the date of conversion. The contractor was entitled to cash compensation of $25,000 upon signing.     On April 8, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year contracting arrangement with a related party for contracting services related to expertise and experience in raising finance. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $120,000 annually in advance.     On July 15, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year contracting arrangement with a related party for contracting services related to expertise and experience in raising finance. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $120,000 annually in advance.     On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into one year contracting arrangement with an unrelated party for contracting services related to expertise and experience in raising finance. As compensation for contractor services the Company will pay the contractor fees of $50,000 annually in advance.      Intellectual Properties      The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 350-50, Website Development Costs. All costs incurred during the planning phase of a website are expensed as research and development.            Costs incurred in the development stage, including the purchase of a domain name, are capitalized and reviewed annually for impairment.     Expenses subsequent to the launch will be expensed as research and development expenses. The Company will expense upgrades and revisions to its website as incurred.     Once the website is available for use, the asset will be amortized over its useful life on a straight line basis, estimated to be 3 years, and is tested for impairment annually.      Accounts payable and accrued liabilities      Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at amortized cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.      Earnings per share      Our company computes loss per share in accordance with "ASC-260", "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. In periods of losses, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, as the effect of stock warrants and convertible debt on loss per share is anti-dilutive.     Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of dilutive shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock warrants using the treasury-stock method and convertible debt computed using as-if converted method. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.      Income taxes      Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Management does not anticipate that the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements will materially impact the Company s financial condition.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures             We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.     As of the end of our quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.     Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.     We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2015: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.      Changes in Internal Control      During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       As a  smaller reporting company  we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       On August 3, 2016 we issued 50,000,000 shares in a private placement at the price of $0.001 for aggregate proceeds of $50,000.
