  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  
  PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT 
  September 30, 2016 

Note 1: General 
  Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account (the  Real Property Account  or the  Registrant ) was established on October 30, 1987 by resolution of the Board of Directors of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ( Pruco Life of New Jersey  or the  Company ), as a separate investment account pursuant to New Jersey law and is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pruco Life of New Jersey is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pruco Life Insurance Company ( Pruco Life ). Pruco Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential ), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. ( Prudential Financial ). The assets of the Real Property Account are segregated from Pruco Life of New Jersey s other assets. The Real Property Account is used to fund benefits under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by Pruco Life of New Jersey. These products are Variable Appreciable Life ( VAL ), Variable Life Insurance ( VLI ), Discovery Plus ( SPVA ), and Discovery Life Plus ( SPVL ). 
    
  The assets of the Real Property Account are invested in The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the  Partnership ). The Partnership is the investment vehicle for assets allocated to the real estate investment option under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. The Real Property Account, along with The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Account and the Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account, are the sole investors in the Partnership. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership. 

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  A.    Basis of Accounting 
    
  The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016 and the statement of net assets as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from Audited Financial Statements, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) on a basis consistent with reporting interim financial information in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial position and results of operations have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Real Property Account s Audited Financial Statements included in the Real Property Account s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates include valuation of investment in the Partnership. 
    
  B.    Investment in Partnership Interest 
    
  The investment in the Partnership is based on the Real Property Account s proportionate interest of the Partnership s fair value measured using the Partnership's net asset value as a practical expedient. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Real Property Account s share of the general partners' controlling interest of the Partnership was   4.5%   or   204,595   shares for both periods. 
    
  C.    Income Recognition 
    
  Net investment income or loss, and recognized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated based upon the monthly average net assets for the investment in the Partnership. Amounts are based on the Real Property Account s proportionate interest in the Partnership.

  PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT 
  September 30, 2016 

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
    
  D.    Equity of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey 
    
  Pruco Life of New Jersey maintains a position in the Real Property Account for liquidity purposes, including unit purchases and redemptions, Partnership share transactions, and expense processing. The position does not affect contract owners  accounts or the related unit values. 
    
  There were no cash transactions at the Real Property Account level for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as all of the transactions are settled by Pruco Life of New Jersey on behalf of the Real Property Account through a redemption or an issuance of units. Therefore, no statement of cash flows is presented for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
  Note 3: Charges and Expenses 
    
  A.     Mortality Risk and Expense Risk Charges 
    
  Mortality risk and expense risk charges are determined daily using an effective annual rate of   0.6%  ,   0.35%  ,   0.9%   and   0.9%   for VAL, VLI, SPVA and SPVL, respectively. Mortality risk is the risk that life insurance contract owners may not live as long as estimated or annuitants may live longer than estimated and expense risk is the risk that the cost of issuing and administering the contracts may exceed related charges by Pruco Life of New Jersey. The mortality risk and expense risk charges are assessed through reduction in unit values. 
    
  B.     Administrative Charges 
    
  Administrative charges are determined daily using an effective annual rate of   0.35%   applied daily against the net assets representing equity of contract owners held in each subaccount for SPVA and SPVL. Administrative charges include costs associated with issuing the contract, establishing and maintaining records, and providing reports to contract owners. The administrative charge is assessed through reduction in unit values. 
    
  C.     Cost of Insurance and Other Related Charges 
    
  Contract owner contributions are subject to certain deductions prior to being invested in the Real Property Account. The deductions for VAL and VLI are: (1) taxes attributable to premiums; (2) sales charges, not to exceed   5%   for VAL, which are deducted in order to compensate Pruco Life of New Jersey for the cost of selling the contract; and (3) transaction costs, applicable to VAL, which are deducted from each premium payment to cover premium collection and processing costs. Contracts are subject to charges on each basic premium for assuming a guaranteed minimum death benefit risk. This charge compensates Pruco Life of New Jersey for the risk that an insured may die at a time when the death benefit exceeds the benefit that would have been payable in the absence of a minimum guarantee. These charges are assessed through the redemption of units. 
    
  D.     Deferred Sales Charge 
    
  For SPVA, there is a deferred sales charge that applies at the time of a full or partial withdrawal, and the amount of the charge (which declines over time) depends on the number of years that have elapsed since the contract was issued.  This deferred sales charge is assessed through the redemption of units. 
    
  E.     Partial Withdrawal Charge 
    
  A charge is imposed by Pruco Life of New Jersey on partial withdrawals of the cash surrender value for VAL. A charge equal to the lesser of   $15   or   2%   will be made in connection with each partial withdrawal of the cash surrender value of a contract. This charge is assessed through the redemption of units.

Note 4: Taxes 
    
  Pruco Life of New Jersey   is taxed as a  life insurance company,  as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. The results of operations of the Real Property Account form a part of Prudential Financial s consolidated federal tax return. Under current federal, state, and local law, no federal, state or local income taxes are payable by the Real Property Account. As such, no provision for a tax liability has been recorded in these financial statements.  Prudential management will review periodically the status of the policy in the event of changes in the tax law. 

Note 5: Net Contributions (Withdrawals) by Contract Owners 
    
  Net contributions (withdrawals) by contract owners for the Real Property Account by product for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:    

Note 6: Partnership Distributions 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Partnership made   no   distribution. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Partnership distributed a total of   $5.0 million  , which occurred on March 30, 2015. The Real Property Account s share of this distribution was   $0.2 million  . 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, there were no purchases of the Partnership by the Real Property Account.

Note 8: Financial Highlights 
  The range of total return for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Note 9: Related Party 
  The Real Property Account has transactions and relationships with Prudential and other affiliates. Due to these relationships, it is possible that the terms of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among unrelated parties.    
  Prudential and its affiliates perform various services on behalf of the Partnership in which the Real Property Account invests and may receive fees for the services performed. These services include, among other things, shareholder communications, postage, transfer agency and various other record keeping and customer service functions. 

Note 10: Fair Value Measurements  
  Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The Real Property Account values its investment in the Partnership using the net asset value provided by the Partnership as a practical expedient. Effective January 1, 2016, the Real Property Account adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-07 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):   Disclosure for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  , which removes the requirement to classify the investment in the Partnership in the fair value hierarchy.  As a result, certain tables and additional disclosures related to the leveling of assets and liabilities are no longer applicable.  ASU 2015-07 was applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  
  Properties owned by the Partnership are illiquid and fair value is based on estimates from property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers as discussed in the notes to the Partnership s unaudited consolidated financial statements. The purpose of an appraisal is to estimate the fair value of real estate as of a specific date. The estimate of fair value of real estate is based on the conventional approaches to value, all of which require the exercise of subjective judgment. The three approaches are: (1) current cost of reproducing the real estate less deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence; (2) discounting a series of income streams and reversion at a specific yield or by directly capitalizing a single year period income estimate by an appropriate factor; and (3) value indicated by recent sales of comparable real estate in the market. In the reconciliation of these three approaches, the independent appraiser uses one or a combination of them, to come up with the approximate value for the type of real estate in the market.    
  The following is a summary of the investment strategy, risks, and redemption provisions of the Partnership. 
  The Partnership has a policy of investing at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, apartments or industrial properties, and participating mortgage loans. The Partnership is subject to the risks inherent in the ownership of real property such as fluctuations in occupancy rates and operating expenses and variations in rental schedules.  The Partnership properties are also subject to the risk of loss due to certain types of damage, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. The Partnership enters into loan agreements with certain lenders to finance its real estate investment transactions. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase related borrowing costs, limit access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the Partnership. Refer to the Partnership s unaudited consolidated financial statements for other related risks. 
  The Partnership allows for withdrawal of cash, in any amount up to a partner s value of the Partnership. Ordinarily payment of the amount requested will be made on the day following the request. The Partnership reserves the right to defer such payments for a period of up to six months if the partners or the investment manager determine that there is insufficient cash available and prompt disposition of investments held by the Partnership cannot be made on commercially reasonable terms.     
  The Real Property Account had no unfunded capital commitments as of September 30, 2016.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
  THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
           A. 
    Basis of Presentation   -The consolidated financial statements of The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the  Partnership ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that are applicable to investment companies. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement have been made. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  For further information, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and notes of the Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Partnership has evaluated subsequent events through November 10, 2016, the date these consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. The partners in the Partnership are The Prudential Insurance Company of America, Pruco Life Insurance Company and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (collectively, the  General Partners ).  
       
  As a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03, as of December 31, 2015 the Partnership reclassified $571,719 of deferred financing costs from other assets to investment level debt.  The new guidance was applied retrospectively. The Partnership's adoption of the guidance did not have a significant effect on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements.    
    
           B. 
    New Accounting Pronouncements   - In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued updated guidance in ASU 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the emerging Issues Task Force) to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments provide clarity on the treatment of eight specifically defined types of cash inflows and outflows. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Partnership is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.    
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance in ASU 2016-02   Leases   (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  The new guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  This new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (  Topic 606  ). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, entities may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. Additionally, this guidance modifies disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This new revenue standard applies to sales of real estate assets to customers, such as sales by homebuilders, merchant builders, land developers, condominium sellers and timeshare sellers. Sales of real estate that constitute a business, when those sales are made to customers, are also within the scope of this new standard. Leasing transactions are not within the scope of this new standard. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. As a result of the deferral, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 for public business entities is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. This new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.

           C. 
    Accounting Pronouncements Adopted   - In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03   Interest-Imputation of Interest   (  Subtopic 835-30  ) which requires entities to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred charge assets, separate from the related debt liability. This guidance does not address how debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements should be presented on the balance sheet or amortized. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.   ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the Securities and Exchange Commission staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance must be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 
       
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance in ASU 2015-02   Consolidation   (  Topic 810  ) that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities, and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.

  Cash paid for interest during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,573,856 and $2,608,412, respectively. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, $3,767,663 was paid for additions to real estate and improvements, which includes $1,376,575 related to 1325 North Wells  development.    

Note 3: Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Valuation Methods: 
    
  Real estate investments are carried at fair value. Properties owned are initially recorded at the purchase price plus closing costs.  Development costs and major renovations are capitalized as a component of cost, and routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Real estate costs include the cost of acquired property, including all the tangible and intangible assets.  Tangible assets include the value of all land, building and tenant improvements at the time of acquisition.  Intangible assets include the value of any above or below market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships at the time of acquisition. 
    
  In general, fair value estimates are based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers (members of the Appraisal Institute or an equivalent organization) within a reasonable amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of PGIM, Inc. ( PGIM ) is responsible for assuring that the valuation process provides independent and reasonable property fair value estimates.  PGIM is an indirectly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. An unaffiliated third party has been appointed by PGIM to assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and the accuracy of the appraisal process.  The fair value of real estate investments does not reflect the transaction sale costs, which may be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments. 
    
  The purpose of an appraisal is to estimate the fair value of real estate as of a specific date.  In accordance with the FASB authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The estimate of fair value is based on the conventional approaches to value, all of which require the exercise of subjective judgment.  The three approaches are: (1) current cost of reproducing the real estate less deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence; (2) discounting a series of income streams and reversion at a specific yield or by directly capitalizing a single year period income estimate by an appropriate factor; and (3) value indicated by recent sales of comparable real estate in the market.  Key inputs and assumptions include rental income

and expense amounts, related rental income and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates. In the reconciliation of these three approaches, the independent appraiser uses one or a combination of them, to come up with the approximate value for the type of real estate in the market. In general, the inputs used in the appraisal process are unobservable; therefore, unless indicated otherwise, real estate investments are classified as Level 3 under the FASB authoritative guidance for fair value measurements.    
    
  Cash equivalents include short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Short-term investments are generally valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible for identical assets and are primarily classified as Level 1. See below for a description of the levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Interest rate caps are recorded at fair value which is determined using discounted cash flow models.  The models  key assumptions include the contractual terms of the contract, along with significant observable inputs, including interest rates, liquidity, credit spreads and other factors including nonperformance risk as well as that of counterparties.  These derivatives are traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  FASB authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a fair value measurement framework, provides a single definition of fair value and requires expanded disclosure summarizing fair value measurements.  This guidance provides a three-level hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation process. The levels in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements fall are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
    
  Level 1 - Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the entity for identical assets or liabilities.  These generally provide the most reliable evidence and should be used to measure fair value whenever available. 
    
  Level 2 - Fair value is based on inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data. 
    
  Level 3 - Fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  These inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and year ended December 31, 2015, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. 
    
  Table 1 below summarizes the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and their respective levels in the fair value hierarchy.

Quantitative Information Regarding Level 3 Assets: 
    
  The tables below represent quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 assets. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. 

* The market value approach represents assets/liabilities in which estimated fair value represents subjective estimates by management based on the investment's specific facts and circumstances.  For example, development assets and recent acquisitions may heavily weight investment cost while pending sales may heavily weight negotiated sales prices in the related fair value estimates.    
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Cost: 
    
  The Partnership is required to disclose the fair value of certain financial instruments that are not reported at fair value. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses and mortgages.  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the instruments  short-term nature. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership s mortgages on wholly-owned properties and consolidated joint ventures have an estimated fair value of approximately $93.1 million and $66.9 million, respectively, and an outstanding principal balance of $93.9 million and $66.6 million, respectively.  The estimated fair value is based on the amount at which the Partnership would pay to transfer the debt at the reporting date taking into consideration the effect of nonperformance risk, including the Partnership s own credit risk. The fair value of debt is determined using the discounted cash flow method, which applies certain key assumptions including the contractual terms of the agreement, market interest rates, interest spreads, credit risk, liquidity and other factors. Different assumptions or changes in future market conditions could significantly affect the estimated fair value. Certain significant inputs used in determining the fair value on investment level debt are unobservable, and therefore, would be considered as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.

Note 4: Interest Rate Caps 
    
  Certain of the Partnership s consolidated joint ventures entered into an interest rate cap transaction ("Cap") with an unrelated major financial institution. The Partnership uses Caps in order to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations or interest rate risk of certain real estate investments  interest expense on variable rate debt.     
    
  The Partnership has recorded the fair value of the Cap in  Other Assets  on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The resulting unrealized gain (loss) is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in  Change in unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate cap.      
    
  The Partnership s Cap is collateralized by the asset attributable to the related investment level debt. As of September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value is $238.    

Note 5: Risk 
    
           A. 
    Valuation Risk 
       
  The estimated fair value of real estate and real estate related assets is generally determined through an appraisal process. These estimated fair values may vary significantly from the prices at which the real estate investments would sell, since market prices of real estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. These differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements. Although the estimated fair values represent subjective estimates, management believes that these estimated fair values are reasonable approximations of market prices and the aggregate estimated value of investments in real estate and improvements are fairly presented as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
    
           B. 
    Credit Risk 
       
  In the normal course of business, the Partnership maintains cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions, which at times may exceed federally insured limits.  The Partnership is subject to credit risk to the extent any financial institution with which it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf.  The Partnership monitors the financial condition of such financial institutions to minimize credit risk exposure. 
    
           C. 
    Financing, Covenant, and Repayment Risks 
       
  In the normal course of business, the Partnership enters into loan agreements with certain lenders to finance its real estate investment transactions. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase related borrowing costs, limit access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the Partnership. There is no guarantee that the Partnership s borrowing arrangements or ability to obtain leverage will continue to be available, or if available, will be on terms and conditions acceptable to the Partnership.  Further, these loan agreements contain, among other conditions, events of default and various covenants and representations.   In the normal course of business, the Partnership may be in the process of renegotiating terms for loans outstanding that have passed their maturity dates.  At September 30, 2016, the Partnership had no outstanding matured loans. 
    
  A decline in market value of the Partnership s assets may also have particular adverse consequences in instances where the Partnership borrowed money based on the fair value of specific assets.  A decrease in market value of these assets may result in the lender requiring the Partnership to post additional collateral or otherwise repay these loans. 
    
  In the event the Partnership s current portfolio and investment obligations are not refinanced or extended when they become due, management anticipates that the repayment of these obligations will be provided by operating cash flow, new debt refinancing, and real estate investment sales.

Note 6: Concentration of Risk on Real Estate Investments and Other Concentrated Risks 
    
  Concentration of risk on real estate investments represents the risk associated with investments that are concentrated in certain geographic regions and industries. The Partnership mitigates this risk by diversifying its investments in various regions and different types of real estate investments. Please refer to the Consolidated Schedules of Real Estate Investments for the Partnership s diversification on the types of real estate investments. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, the Partnership had real estate investments located throughout the United States. The diversification of the Partnership s holdings based on the estimated fair values and established National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries ("NCREIF") regions is as follows: 

The allocations above are based on 100% of the estimated fair value of wholly-owned properties and consolidated joint ventures.  The Partnership has no significant concentrations of tenants as no single tenant has annual contract rent that makes up more than 15% of the rental income of the Partnership.    
    
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were two partners who each held investments in the Partnership that represented greater than 10% of the Partnership's net asset value. 

Note 7: Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. In the opinion of the Partnership s management, the outcome of such matters will not have a significant effect on the financial position of the Partnership. 
    
  The Partnership has private real estate equity investments for which it is contractually obligated to fund additional capital after its initial investments as well as those in which capital is provided without being contractually obligated to do so. Such additional capital is generally provided in the ordinary course of business to fund recurring and non-recurring capital improvement activities of underlying real estate investments. For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership did not fund any contractual obligations on committed capital. The Partnership does not typically provide material non-contractual financial support to investees.    
    
  As of  September 30, 2016, the Partnership's share of unfunded debt obligations related to real estate and improvements is $11.1 million. The Partnership does not have equity commitments to fund properties under development.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  All of the assets of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account (the "Real Property Account") are invested in The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the "Partnership"). Accordingly, the liquidity and capital resources and results of operations for the Real Property Account are contingent upon those of the Partnership. Therefore, this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses these items at the Partnership level. The general partners in the Partnership are The Prudential Insurance Company of America, Pruco Life Insurance Company, and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (collectively, the  General Partners ).  
    
  The following discussion and analysis of the liquidity and capital resources and results of operations of the Partnership should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements of the Real Property Account and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and the related Notes included in this filing.     

(a) Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership s liquid assets, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, were approximately $48.5 million, an increase of approximately $34.1 million from $14.4 million as of December 31, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the following activities: (a) $28.2 million of proceeds from investment level debt; (b) $5.7 million of proceeds from the sale of an office property in Lisle, IL; and (c) $5.9 million of cash flow generated from property operations. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease due to: (a) $0.9 million of principal payments on financed properties; (b) $0.6 million of deferred financing payments on financed properties; (c) $0.3 million in distributions to joint venture partners; (d) $0.1 million increase to restricted cash; and (e) $3.8 million paid for capital improvements.  The $3.8 million paid for capital improvements included the following items:  (a) $1.4 million for construction costs at the development property in Chicago, IL; (b) $0.9 million for space renovations at the retail property in Dunn, NC; (c) $0.8 million for space renovations at the retail property in Hampton, VA; and (d) $0.7 million for capital improvements and transaction costs associated with leasing expenses at various properties. 
    
  Sources of liquidity included net cash flow from property operations and interest from cash equivalents. The Partnership uses cash for its real estate investment activities and for distributions to its partners. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 15.3% of the Partnership s total assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents.     

(b) Results of Operations 
    
  The following is a comparison of the Partnership s results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September  30, 2016 and 2015.  
    
  Net investment income/(loss) overview 
    
  The Partnership s net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $4.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million from the prior year period. The increase in net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million in the office sector investment s net investment income from the prior year period and an increase of approximately $0.4 million in the retail sector investments  net investment income from the prior year period.  Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of approximately $0.2 million from the prior year period in net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest from the apartment sector and an increase of approximately $0.3 million from prior year period in portfolio level expenses. 
    
  The Partnership s net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.9 million, an increase of approximately $0.4 million from the prior year period. The increase in net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest was primarily due to an increase of $0.3 million in the retail sector investments  net investment income from the prior year period and an increase of approximately $0.3 million in the office sector investment s net investment income from the prior year period. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of approximately $0.1 million from the prior year period in net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest from the hotel sector and an increase of approximately $0.2 million from prior year period in portfolio level expenses.

Valuation overview 
    
  The Partnership recorded a net recognized and unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $3.2 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. This is compared with a net recognized and unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $8.9 million for the prior year period. The unrealized gains attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were due to valuation increases in the apartment and retail investments of $3.4 million. Partially offsetting the unrealized gains was a recognized loss of $0.3 million in the office sector investments. 
    
  The Partnership recorded net unrealized gains attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $1.9 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. This is compared with net unrealized gains attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $6.5 million for the prior year period. The unrealized gains attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were due to valuation increases in the apartment and retail sector investments. 
    
  The following table presents a comparison of the Partnership s sources of net investment income (loss) attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest and net recognized and unrealized gains (losses) attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

OFFICE PROPERTIES   
                       (1)    The Lisle, IL property was sold on January 21, 2016. The net investment income represents post closing liability write-offs. 
       (2)    The Beaverton, OR property was sold on June 8, 2015. 

Net investment income/(loss) 
    
  Net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the Partnership s office properties was approximately $0.3 million for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which represents an increase of approximately $0.7 million and $0.3 million from the prior year periods, respectively. The increase in net investment income is due to selling the properties in Lisle, IL, and Beaverton, OR.  The two properties had large vacancies and were providing negative cash flow resulting in losses in 2015. The net investment income in both periods represents post closing liability write-offs. 
    
  Recognized and unrealized gain/(loss) 
    
  The office property formerly owned by the Partnership recorded a recognized loss attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $0.3 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared with a recognized and net unrealized loss attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $0.5 million from the prior year period.  The recognized loss attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was due to the sale of the property located in Lisle, IL.

APARTMENT PROPERTIES   

Net investment income/(loss) 
    
  Net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the Partnership s apartment properties was approximately $2.9 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, which represents a decrease of approximately $0.2 million from the prior year period. The decrease over the nine month period was primarily due to the interest expense associated with the property in Austin, TX, which was financed in January 2016. Net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the Partnership s apartment properties was approximately $1.0 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, which remained relatively flat over the prior year period.  An increase due to repairs and maintenance expense savings at the property in Maplewood, NJ was offset primarily due to an increase of interest expense associated with the property in Austin, TX.  
    
  Unrealized gain/(loss) 
    
  The apartment properties owned by the Partnership recorded a net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $2.3 million and $1.4 million for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with a net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $5.0 million and $3.2 million from the prior year periods, respectively.  The net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to favorable market leasing assumptions at both properties in Seattle, WA, as well as the properties in Charlotte, NC and Austin, TX.  Additionally, gains at the property in Maplewood, NJ were primarily due to rent increases.  The net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to favorable market leasing assumptions at the properties in Austin, TX and Seattle, WA.  Additional gains were provided by a decrease to anticipated near term capital expenditures at the property in Charlotte, NC.

RETAIL PROPERTIES   

Net investment income/(loss) 
  Net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the Partnership s retail properties was approximately $4.6 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, which represents an increase of approximately $0.4 million from the prior year period.  The increase was largely due to interest expense savings from the loan payoff at the property in Roswell, GA.  Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease at the property in Dunn, NC due to increased operating expenses for repairs and maintenance. Net investment income attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the Partnership s retail properties was approximately $1.7 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, which represents an increase of approximately $0.3 million from the prior year period.  The increase was largely from interest expense savings from the loan payoff at the property in Roswell, GA, and an increased occupancy at the property in Dunn, NC. 
    
  Unrealized gain/(loss) 
    
  The retail properties owned by the Partnership recorded a net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $1.1 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $4.4 million from the prior year period. The net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to decreased investment rates for the entire retail sector with the exception of the property in Hampton, VA.  Investment rates include direct and terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates, which reflect investors  yield requirements on investments. Additional gains were provided by favorable market leasing assumptions for the properties in Ocean City, MD and Westminster, MD. The retail properties owned by the Partnership recorded a net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $0.5 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest of approximately $3.2 million from the prior year period. The net unrealized gain attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to increased occupancy at the property in Dunn, NC.  Additional gains were provided by decreased investment rates for the properties in Norcross, GA, and Roswell, GA.  Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease at the property in Hampton, VA due to an increase to investment rates and the loss of a tenant.

HOTEL PROPERTY   

Net investment income/(loss) 
  Net investment loss attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest for the Partnership s hotel property was  approximately $0.1 million for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  This property was sold on October 29, 2014.  The net investment loss in both periods represents post closing expenses.    
    
  OTHER 
    
  Other net investment expense mainly includes investment management fees, other portfolio level expenses and interest income.  Other net investment expense attributable to the General Partners  controlling interest was approximately $2.8 million and $1.0 million for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which represents an increase of approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million from the prior year periods, respectively.  The increases are primarily due to audit fees, property appraisals, and investment management fees.

(c) Inflation 
    
  A majority of the Partnership s leases with its commercial tenants provide for recoveries of expenses based upon the tenant s proportionate share of, and/or increases in, real estate taxes and certain operating costs, which may partially reduce the Partnership s exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management reviews critical estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. If management determines, as a result of its consideration of facts and circumstances, that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate, results of operations and financial position as reported in the unaudited financial statements of the Real Property Account and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership may change significantly. 
  The following sections discuss those critical accounting policies applied in preparing the unaudited financial statements of the Real Property Account and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. 
    
  Valuation of Investments 
    
  Real estate investments are carried at fair value. Properties owned are initially recorded at the purchase price plus closing costs. Development costs and major renovations are capitalized as a component of cost, and routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Real estate costs include the cost of acquired property, including all the tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets include the value of all land, building and tenant improvements at the time of acquisition. Intangible assets include the value of any above and below market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships at the time of acquisition. 
    
  In general, fair value estimates are based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers (members of the Appraisal Institute or an equivalent organization) within a reasonable amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of PGIM, Inc. ( PGIM ) is responsible for assuring that the valuation process provides independent and reasonable property fair value estimates. PGIM is an indirectly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc.  An unaffiliated third party has been appointed by PGIM to assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and the accuracy of the appraisal process. The fair value of real estate investments does not reflect the transaction sale costs, which may be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments. 
  The purpose of an appraisal is to estimate the fair value of real estate as of a specific date.  In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The estimate of fair value is based on the conventional approaches to value, all of which require the exercise of subjective judgment.  The three approaches are:  (1) current cost of reproducing the real estate less deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence; (2) discounting a series of income streams and reversion at a specific yield or by directly capitalizing a single year period income estimate by an appropriate factor; and (3) value indicated by recent sales of comparable real estate in the market.  Key inputs and assumptions include rental income and expense amounts, related rental income and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates. In the reconciliation of these three approaches, the independent appraiser uses one, or a combination, of them to determine the approximate value for the type of real estate in the market.    
  Cash equivalents include short-term investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.  
    
  Other Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited financial statements of the Real Property Account and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Partnership, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  The table below discloses the Partnership s investment level debt as of September 30, 2016.  The fair value of the Partnership s long-term investment level debt is affected by changes in market interest rates.  The following table presents principal cash flows based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the debt.      

Credit Risk -   The Partnership is exposed to market risk from tenants. While the Partnership has not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of significant increases in interest rates and/or an economic downturn, tenant delinquencies could increase and result in losses to the Partnership and the Real Property Account that could adversely affect their operating results and liquidity. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ) Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2016. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. No change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
