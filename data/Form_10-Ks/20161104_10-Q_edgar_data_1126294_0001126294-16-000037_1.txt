COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1       Basis of Presentation   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  GenOn Energy, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, is a wholesale power generator engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities, with approximately   15,826   MW of net electric generating capacity located in the U.S.  During 2016, GenOn completed the sales of the Aurora, Seward and Shelby facilities and deactivated Avon Lake Unit 7, which were the primary drivers resulting in a net decrease in operating generation capacity of   1,927   MW from December 31, 2015.  
  GenOn Americas Generation is a wholesale power generator with approximately   7,907   MW of net electric generating capacity located, in many cases, near major metropolitan areas.  GenOn Americas Generation's electric generating capacity is part of the   15,826   MW of net electric generating capacity of GenOn.  
  GenOn Mid-Atlantic operates and owns or leases   4,605   MW of net electric generating capacity in Maryland near Washington, D.C.  GenOn Mid-Atlantic s electric generating capacity is part of the   7,907   MW of net electric generating capacity of GenOn Americas Generation.  GenOn Mid-Atlantic s generating stations serve the Eastern PJM markets. 
  GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic are Delaware limited liability companies and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of GenOn.  GenOn Mid-Atlantic is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GenOn Americas Generation.   
  The Registrants sell power from their generation portfolio, offer capacity or similar products to retail electric providers and others, and provide ancillary services to support system reliability.    
  This is a combined quarterly report of the Registrants for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  The notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements apply to the Registrants as indicated parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure.  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the SEC's regulations for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  The following notes should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies and other disclosures as set forth in the notes to the Registrants' financial statements in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments consisting of normal and recurring accruals necessary to present fairly the Registrants' consolidated financial positions as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of operations, comprehensive income/(loss) and cash flows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  .  
  Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming GenOn will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  As such, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should GenOn be unable to continue as a going concern.  Such adjustments could have a material adverse impact on GenOn's results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  As disclosed in   Note 7  ,   Debt and Capital Leases  , as of September 30, 2016,   $703 million   of GenOn's Senior Notes outstanding are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet and are due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity exclusive of cash subject to the restrictions under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases to repay the senior notes due in June 2017.  As a result of these factors, there is no assurance GenOn will continue as a going concern. 
  
   15 

As of September 30, 2016, GenOn has cash and cash equivalents of   $1.2 billion  , of which   $483 million   and   $110 million   is held by GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA, respectively.  Under their respective operating leases, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless: (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period for four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Additionally, REMA must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing its obligation to pay scheduled rent under its lease.  As a result, GenOn Mid-Atlantic has not been able to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since the quarter ended March 31, 2014 which was the last quarterly period for which GenOn Mid-Atlantic satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement.  REMA has not satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since 2009. 
  NRG, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support other than as described in   Note 9  ,   Related Party Transactions  . 
  GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors and lessors, refinancing the senior notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During the second quarter of 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors and, during the third quarter of 2016, GenOn retained advisors as part of this process. 
  Use of Estimates    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.    
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.  The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  Other Balance Sheet Information 
  The following table presents the accumulated depreciation included in property plant and equipment, net, and accumulated amortization included in intangible assets, net, respectively, for each of the Registrants as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Recent Accounting Developments (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation, and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  ASU 2016-16         In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)  , Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, or ASU No. 2016-16.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 were issued to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party which has resulted in diversity in practice and increased complexity within financial reporting.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 would require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and do not require new disclosure requirements.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-16 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Registrants  results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  ASU 2016-15     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  , Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, or ASU No. 2016-15.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 were issued to address eight specific cash flow issues for which stakeholders have indicated to the FASB that a diversity in practice existed in how entities were presenting and classifying these items in the statement of cash flows.  The issues addressed by ASU No. 2016-15 include but are not limited to the classification of debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, payments made for contingent consideration for a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance proceeds, distributions received from equity method investees and separately identifiable cash flows and the application of the predominance principle.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-15 are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods in those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim fiscal period with all amendments adopted in the same period.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 is required to be applied retrospectively.  The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Registrants  statement of cash flows. 
  ASU 2016-02     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842), or ASU No. 2016-02.  The amendments of ASU No. 2016-02 complete the joint effort between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, to develop a common leasing standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, with the objective to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to improve financial reporting.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 provides that a lessee that may have previously accounted for a lease as an operating lease under current GAAP should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from a lease on the balance sheet.  In addition, ASU No. 2016-02 expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures with regards to lease arrangements.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods.  The adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach for the earliest period presented and early adoption is permitted.  The Registrants are currently working through an adoption plan which includes the evaluation of lease contracts compared to the new standard and evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on the Registrants' results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  
   17 

ASU 2016-01     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall   (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or ASU No. 2016-01. The amendments of ASU No. 2016-01 eliminate available-for-sale classification of equity investments and require that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be generally measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Further, the amendments require that financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset.  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Registrants are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the Registrants' results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  ASU 2014-09     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606), or ASU No. 2014-09.  The amendments of ASU No. 2014-09 complete the joint effort between the FASB and the IASB, to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and IFRS, and to improve financial reporting.  In addition to ASU No. 2014-09, the FASB issued additional guidance which provides further clarification on Topic 606 including ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12.  The guidance under Topic 606 provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services provided and establishes a four step process to be applied by an entity in evaluating its contracts with customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which formally deferred the effective date by one year to make the guidance of ASU No. 2014-09 effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted, but not prior to the original effective date, which was for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Registrants are working through an adoption plan which includes the evaluation of revenue contracts compared to the new standard and evaluating the impact of Topic 606 on the Registrants' results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
   
  Note 3       Dispositions   (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation) 
  Potrero Disposition (GenOn Americas Generation) 
     On September 26, 2016, NRG Potrero LLC, or Potrero, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GenOn Americas Generation, completed the sale of real property at the Potrero generating station located in San Francisco, CA to California Barrel Company, LLC for total consideration of   $86 million   comprised of   $74 million   of cash received, which is net of   $8 million   of closing costs and   $4 million   to be held in escrow in order to cover post closing obligations.  The sale resulted in a gain of approximately   $74 million   recognized within GenOn Americas Generation's consolidated results of operations during the third quarter of 2016.     
  In October 2016, in connection with the completion of the Potrero real property disposition, Potrero received   $16 million   from GenOn Energy Holdings for the settlement of a note receivable which reduced the outstanding note receivable   affiliate balance of   $331 million   as of September 30, 2016 to   $315 million   during the fourth quarter of 2016.  Refer to   Note 9  ,   Related Party Transactions       Intercompany Cash Management Program   for further discussion of the note receivable   affiliate. 
  Aurora Disposition (GenOn) 
  On May 12, 2016, GenOn entered into an agreement with RA Generation, LLC to sell the Aurora Generating Station, or Aurora, for cash consideration of   $365 million  , subject to adjustments for working capital and the results of the PJM 2019/2020 Base Residual Auction.  Aurora is an   878   MW natural gas facility located in Aurora, Illinois.  On July 12, 2016, GenOn completed the sale of Aurora for cash proceeds of   $369 million  , including   $4 million   in adjustments primarily for the PJM base residual auction results and estimated working capital, which is subject to further adjustment.  The sale resulted in a gain of approximately   $188 million   recognized within GenOn's consolidated results of operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  In connection with the sale, GenOn issued a guaranty to RA Generation, LLC for the payment of certain indemnified costs related to any damages, losses, or other expenses arising out of misrepresentation or breach of warranties or covenants under the purchase agreement subject to a cap of   $365 million  , which is reduced to   $183 million   on January 1, 2018 and then to   $91 million   beginning January 1, 2019 and will terminate upon the third anniversary of the sale. 
  
   18

  On November 24, 2015, GenOn entered into an agreement with Seward Generation, LLC and an affiliate of Robindale Energy Services, Inc. to sell   100%   of its interest in the Seward Generating Station, a   525   MW coal-fired facility in Pennsylvania, for cash consideration of   $75 million  .  At December 31, 2015, GenOn had classified on its balance sheet the assets and liabilities of Seward as held for sale.  On February 2, 2016, GenOn completed the sale of Seward and received gross cash proceeds of   $75 million   excluding   $3 million   of cash on hand transferred to the buyer.  GenOn will also receive   $5 million   in deferred cash consideration in five   $1 million   annual installments and up to   $2.5 million   in payments contingent upon certain environmental requirements being impose by August 2017.  In addition, Robindale committed to future inventory purchases from GenOn of   $13 million   through 2019.  
  Shelby Disposition (GenOn) 
  On November 9, 2015, GenOn entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Rockland Power Partners II, LP and Shelby County Energy Center, LLC to sell   100%   of its interest in the Shelby Generating Station, a   352   MW natural gas-fired facility located in Illinois for cash consideration of   $46 million  .  At December 31, 2015, GenOn had classified on its balance sheet the assets and liabilities of Shelby as held for sale.  On March 1, 2016, GenOn completed the sale of Shelby for cash proceeds of   $46 million   which resulted in a gain of   $29 million   recognized within GenOn's consolidated results of operations during the first quarter of 2016.  In addition, GenOn retained   $10 million   related to future revenue rights as part of the agreement of which   $7 million   had been received as of September 30, 2016. 

Note 4       Fair Value of Financial Instruments   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic)    
  This footnote should be read in conjunction with the complete description under   Note 4  ,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  , to the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K.   
  For cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and cash collateral paid and received in support of energy risk management activities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. 
  The estimated carrying amounts and fair values of GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation s debt are as follows:  
  GenOn  

The fair value of long-term debt that is estimated using reported market prices for instruments that are publicly traded is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of non-publicly traded debt is based on the income approach valuation technique using current interest rates for similar instruments with equivalent credit quality and is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  The following table presents the level within the fair value hierarchy for long-term debt, including current portion as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  Derivative Fair Value Measurements       
  A portion of the Registrants' contracts are exchange-traded contracts with readily available quoted market prices.  A majority of the Registrants' contracts are non-exchange-traded contracts valued using prices provided by external sources, primarily price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter and on-line exchanges.  The remainder of the assets and liabilities represent contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available for the whole term or for certain delivery months.  These contracts are valued using various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models that apply fundamental analysis of the market and corroboration with similar markets.  As of   September 30, 2016  , contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques make up   1%   of GenOn's derivative assets and   3%   of GenOn's derivative liabilities,   3%   of GenOn Americas Generation s derivative assets and   2%   of GenOn Americas Generation's derivative liabilities and   1%   of GenOn Mid-Atlantic s derivative assets and   0%   of GenOn Mid-Atlantic's derivative liabilities. 
   The Registrants' significant positions classified as Level 3 include financial power and physical coal executed in illiquid markets as well as financial transmission rights, or FTRs. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid power and coal location pricing, which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. For FTRs, the Registrants use the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value.

The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate.  In addition, the Registrants apply a non-performance/credit reserve to reflect credit risk which is calculated based on published default probabilities.  To the extent that the Registrants' net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Registrants use the counterparty's default swap rate.  The credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume the Registrants' liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for the Registrants' assets.  The Registrants' (non-performance)/credit reserves were as follows: 

Under the guidance of ASC 815, entities may choose to offset cash collateral paid or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements.  The Registrants have chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn recorded   $119 million   of cash collateral paid, which includes   $76 million   of collateral paid to NRG, and   $10 million   of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn Americas Generation recorded   $117 million   of cash collateral paid, which includes   $76 million   of collateral paid to NRG, and   $10 million   of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn Mid-Atlantic had   no   outstanding cash collateral paid or received on its balance sheet. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk  
  In addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in   Note 2  ,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , to the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K, the following is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Registrants  financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  The Registrants are exposed to counterparty credit risk through various activities including wholesale sales and fuel purchases. 
  Counterparty Credit Risk 
  The Registrants' counterparty credit risk policies are disclosed in their   2015   Form 10-K.  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn's counterparty credit exposure was   $189 million   and GenOn held   no   collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions, resulting in a net exposure of   $189 million  .      Approximately   97%   of GenOn's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of   2017  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn Americas Generation s counterparty credit exposure was   $183 million   and GenOn Americas Generation held   no   collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions, resulting in a net exposure of   $183 million  .  Approximately   97%   of GenOn Americas Generation s exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of   2017  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn Mid-Atlantic had   no   counterparty credit exposure.  The following tables highlight net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality.  Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for the Registrants with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS and non-derivative transactions.  The exposure is shown net of collateral held and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

(a) 
    Counterparty credit exposure excludes uranium and coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices. 
              (b) 
    For non-rated counterparties, a significant portion are related to ISO and municipal public power entities, which are considered investment grade equivalent ratings based on NRG's internal credit ratings. 
     The Registrants have counterparty credit risk exposure to certain counterparties, each of which represent more than   10%   of their respective total net exposure discussed above. The aggregate of such counterparties' exposure was   $158 million  ,   $158 million   and   $0 million   for GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic, respectively.  Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, the Registrants do not anticipate a material impact on their financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any of their counterparties.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn had energy-related derivative financial instruments extending through 2019. 
  Volumetric Underlying Derivative Transactions (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  The following table summarizes the net notional volume buy/(sell) of the Registrants  open derivative transactions broken out by commodity, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Option contracts are reflected using delta volume.  Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.

Impact of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Operations (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  Unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reflected in current period earnings.  
  During 2016, the Registrants' have been undergoing the process of closing out and financially settling certain open positions with counterparties.  The closure and financial settlements with these counterparties were necessary to manage the increases in collateral posting requirements following rating agency downgrades, as further described in   Note 7  ,   Debt and Capital Leases  , and reduce expected collateral costs associated with exchange cleared hedge transactions. 
  The following tables summarize the pre-tax effects of economic hedges.  These amounts are included within operating revenues and cost of operations. 
  GenOn 

As discussed above, GenOn realized approximately   $38 million   due to the closure and financial settlement of all open positions with one of GenOn's counterparties during the second quarter of 2016, for which   $18 million  ,   $19 million   and   $1 million   would have realized during the remainder of 2016 and in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  In addition, GenOn realized   $98 million   due to the closure and financial settlement of certain open positions with an additional counterparty during the third quarter of 2016, for which   $82 million  ,   $13 million   and   $3 million   would have otherwise been realized in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.  GenOn has entered into additional transactions with NRG Power Marketing LLC and an external counterparty in order to re-hedge the positions settled with certain counterparties. 
  
   30 

GenOn Americas Generation 

As discussed above, GenOn Americas Generation realized approximately   $35 million   due to the closure and financial settlement of all open positions with one of GenOn Americas Generation's counterparties during the second quarter of 2016, for which   $16 million   and   $19 million   would have otherwise been realized during the remainder of 2016 and in 2017, respectively.  In addition, GenOn Americas Generation realized   $50 million   due to the closure and financial settlement of certain open positions with an additional counterparty during the third quarter of 2016, for which   $46 million   and   $4 million   would have otherwise been realized in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  GenOn has entered into additional transactions with NRG Power Marketing LLC and an external counterparty in order to re-hedge the positions settled with certain counterparties. 
  GenOn Mid-Atlantic 

As discussed above, GenOn Mid-Atlantic realized approximately   $35 million   due to the closure and financial settlement of all open positions with one of GenOn Mid-Atlantic's counterparties during the second quarter of 2016, for which   $16 million   and   $19 million   would have otherwise been realized during the remainder of 2016 and in 2017, respectively.  In addition, GenOn Mid-Atlantic realized   $50 million   due to the closure and financial settlement of certain open positions with an additional counterparty during the third quarter of 2016, for which   $46 million   and   $4 million   would have otherwise been realized in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  GenOn has entered into additional transactions with NRG Power Marketing LLC and an external counterparty in order to re-hedge the positions settled with certain counterparties.

Credit Risk Related Contingent Features (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  Certain of GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation s hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Registrants to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed "adequate assurance" under the agreements, or require the Registrants to post additional collateral if there were a one notch downgrade in the Registrants  credit rating.  The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as of   September 30, 2016  , was   $13 million   for GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   collateral was required for contracts with credit rating contingent features that are in a net liability position for GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation.  GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation are also party to certain marginable agreements under which   $2 million   collateral was due as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn Mid-Atlantic did not have any financial instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features.  
  See   Note 4  ,   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ,   for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.

  Long-Lived Asset Impairments (GenOn) 
  Mandalay and Ormond Beach (GenOn)     On May 26  ,   2016, the CPUC rejected a multi-year resource adequacy contract between Mandalay and Southern California Edison.  Also during the second quarter of 2016, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures, or SACCWIS, issued a draft April 2016 Report noting that CAISO plans to continue to assume in its transmission studies that Ormond Beach will not operate after December 31, 2020, the deadline for Ormond Beach compliance with California regulations to mitigate once-through cooling (OTC) impacts.  The Registrant does not anticipate that contracts of sufficient value can be secured to support the significant investment required to design, permit, construct and operate measures required for OTC compliance.  As a result, on May 6, 2016, the Registrant notified SACCWIS that it does not expect to continue to operate Ormond Beach beyond 2020.  Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, CAISO issued its Local Capacity Requirements report for 2017 indicating unfavorable changes within the local reliability areas in which both Mandalay and Ormond Beach are located.  The culmination of these events were considered to be indicators of impairment and as a result, GenOn performed impairment tests for the Mandalay and Ormond Beach assets under ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment  .  Based on the results of the impairment tests, GenOn determined that the carrying amount of these assets was higher than the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the respective assets and that the Mandalay and Ormond Beach assets were impaired.  The fair value of the Mandalay and Ormond Beach operating units was determined using the income approach which utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements and include key inputs such as forecasted contract prices, forecasted operating expenses and discount rates.  GenOn measured the impairment losses as the difference between the carrying amount of the Mandalay and Ormond Beach operating units and the present value of the estimated future net cash flows for each respective operating unit.  GenOn recorded an impairment loss of   $16 million   and   $43 million   for Mandalay and Ormond Beach, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2016.

Note 7      Debt and Capital Leases   (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation) 
  Long-term debt and capital leases consisted of the following: 

(a)    The Long Term Service Agreement for the Hunterstown facility is accounted for as a debt financing liability in accordance with GAAP. 
  Long-term debt including current maturities includes the following premiums: 

On October 7, 2016, GenOn's corporate credit rating was lowered by Moody's from Caa2 to Caa3 and its probability of default rating was lowered from Caa2-PD to Caa3-PD. In addition, Moody's also lowered the ratings of REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic's pass through certificates to Caa1 from B2.  These changes are an update from March 21, 2016, at which time GenOn's corporate credit rating was lowered from B3 to Caa2. At that time, Moody's also lowered the issue-level ratings on the GenOn Senior Notes from B3 to Caa2 and the GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes from Caa1 to Caa2. 
  On May 24, 2016, GenOn's corporate credit rating was lowered by S P to CCC from CCC+.  S P also lowered the issue-level ratings on the GenOn Senior Notes from B- to CCC+ and the GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes from CCC+ to CCC.

Note 8       Income Taxes   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
     GenOn 
  GenOn s income tax expense consisted of the following: 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and 2015, respectively, GenOn's overall effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to a change in the valuation allowance, offset by the impact of state income taxes associated with the disposition of generating stations during the year. 
  GenOn Americas Generation 
  GenOn Americas Generation's allocated income taxes resulting from its operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   were   $0  .  GenOn Americas Generation's pro forma income taxes resulting from its operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   are   $0   due to the valuation allowance recorded on its stand-alone financial results. 
  GenOn Mid-Atlantic 
  GenOn Mid-Atlantic s allocated income taxes resulting from its operations are   $0   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015  .  The pro forma income tax provision attributable to income before taxes is a tax expense of   $23 million   and   $17 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The pro forma income tax provision attributable to income before taxes is a tax expense of   $25 million   and   $27 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The balance of GenOn Mid-Atlantic's pro forma deferred income taxes is a net deferred tax asset of   $31 million   and   $56 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as   no   valuation allowance is required on the net deferred tax asset. 
   
  Note 9       Related Party Transactions   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  Services Agreement with NRG  
   NRG provides GenOn with various management, personnel and other services, which include human resources, regulatory and public affairs, accounting, tax, legal, information systems, treasury, risk management, commercial operations, and asset management, as set forth in its services agreement with NRG, or the Services Agreement.  The initial term of the Services Agreement was through December 31, 2013, with an automatic renewal absent a request for termination. The fee charged is determined based on a fixed amount as described in the Services Agreement and was calculated based on historical GenOn expenses prior to the NRG Merger.  The annual fees under the Services Agreement are approximately   $193 million  .  NRG charges these fees on a monthly basis, less amounts incurred directly by GenOn.  Management has concluded that this method of charging overhead costs is reasonable.  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , GenOn recorded costs related to these services of   $46 million   and   $139 million  , respectively, as general and administrative   affiliate. For the three and   nine months ended   September 30, 2015, GenOn recorded costs related to these services of   $42 million   and   $139 million  , respectively, as general and administrative   affiliate. 
   Under the Services Agreement, NRG also provides GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic with various management, personnel and other services consistent with those set forth in the Services Agreement discussed above between NRG and GenOn.  GenOn's costs incurred under the Services Agreement with NRG are allocated to its subsidiaries based on each operating subsidiary's planned operating expenses relative to all operating subsidiaries of GenOn.  These allocations and charges are not necessarily indicative of what would have been incurred had GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic been unaffiliated entities.  Management has concluded that this method of charging overhead costs is reasonable.

Credit Agreement with NRG (GenOn)  
  GenOn and NRG Americas, Inc. are party to a secured intercompany revolving credit agreement with NRG.  This credit agreement provides for a   $500 million   revolving credit facility, all of which is available for revolving loans and letters of credit.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $207 million   and   $278 million  , respectively, of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the NRG credit agreement for GenOn.  Of this amount,   $149 million   and   $227 million  , respectively, were issued on behalf of GenOn Americas Generation, which includes   $76 million   and   $131 million   issued on behalf of GenOn Mid-Atlantic as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   loans were outstanding under this credit agreement.  Certain of GenOn's subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a guarantee agreement pursuant to which these guarantors guaranteed amounts borrowed and obligations incurred under the credit agreement.  The guarantors are restricted from incurring additional liens on certain of their assets.  The credit agreement is payable at maturity, subject to certain exceptions primarily related to asset sales not in the ordinary course of business and borrowings of debt and matures in December of 2018.  At GenOn's election, the interest rate per year applicable to the loans under the credit agreement will be determined by reference to either (i) the base rate plus   2.50%   per year or (ii) the LIBOR rate plus   3.50%   per year.  In addition, the credit agreement contains customary covenants and events of default.  As of September 30, 2016, GenOn was in compliance with covenants under the credit agreement with NRG.  
  Intercompany Cash Management Program (GenOn Americas Generation)  
  GenOn Americas Generation and certain of its subsidiaries participate in separate intercompany cash management programs whereby cash balances at GenOn Americas Generation and the respective participating subsidiaries are transferred to central concentration accounts to fund working capital and other needs of the respective participants.  The balances under this program are reflected as notes receivable   affiliate and accounts receivable   affiliate or notes payable   affiliate and accounts payable   affiliate, as appropriate.  The balances are due on demand and notes receivable   affiliate and     notes payable   affiliate     accrue interest on the net position, which is payable quarterly, at a rate determined by GenOn Energy Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of GenOn.  At   September 30, 2016  , and December 31,   2015  , GenOn Americas Generation had a net current note receivable   affiliate from GenOn Energy Holdings of   $331 million   related to its intercompany cash management program.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , GenOn Americas Generation earned an   insignificant   amount of net interest income related to these notes.  Additionally, at   September 30, 2016  , and December 31,   2015  , GenOn Americas Generation had an accounts payable   affiliate of   $17 million   and   $41 million  , respectively, with GenOn Energy Holdings.  Refer to   Note 3  ,   Dispositions   for discussion of the sale of real property at Potrero and related settlement of the note receivable.

Intercompany Hedging Agreements with NRG  
  Under intercompany agreements, NRG Power Marketing LLC may from time to time enter into physical and financial intercompany commodity and hedging transactions with GenOn and certain of its subsidiaries.  Subject to applicable collateral thresholds, these arrangements may provide for the bilateral exchange of credit support based upon market exposure and potential market movements.  The terms and conditions of the agreements are generally consistent with industry practices and other third party arrangements.  As of September 30, 2016, GenOn has   no   net exposure under these arrangements. 
   
  Note 10       Commitments and Contingencies   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  This footnote should be read in conjunction with the complete description under   Note 15  ,   Commitment and Contingencies  , to the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Contingencies  
  The Registrants  material legal proceedings are described below.  The Registrants believe that they have valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intend to defend them vigorously.  The Registrants record reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated.  As applicable, the Registrants' have established an adequate reserve for the matters discussed below.  In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred.  Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success.  Unless specified below, the Registrants are unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities.  As additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly.  Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Registrants  liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from their currently recorded reserves and that such difference could be material.   
  In addition to the legal proceedings noted below, the Registrants are parties to other litigation or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect the Registrants  respective consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
  Actions Pursued by MC Asset Recovery (GenOn)     With Mirant Corporation's emergence from bankruptcy protection in 2006, certain actions filed by GenOn Energy Holdings and some of its subsidiaries against third parties were transferred to MC Asset Recovery, a wholly owned subsidiary of GenOn Energy Holdings.  MC Asset Recovery is governed by a manager who is independent of NRG and GenOn.  MC Asset Recovery is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes.  Under the remaining action transferred to MC Asset Recovery, MC Asset Recovery seeks to recover damages from Commerzbank AG and various other banks, or the Commerzbank Defendants, for alleged fraudulent transfers that occurred prior to Mirant's bankruptcy proceedings.  In December 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas dismissed MC Asset Recovery's complaint against the Commerzbank Defendants.  In January 2011, MC Asset Recovery appealed the District Court's dismissal of its complaint against the Commerzbank Defendants to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, or the Fifth Circuit.  In March 2012, the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Court's dismissal and reinstated MC Asset Recovery's amended complaint against the Commerzbank Defendants. On December 10, 2015, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commerzbank Defendants. On December 29, 2015, MC Asset Recovery filed a notice to appeal this judgment with the Fifth Circuit.  The appeal has been fully briefed by the parties. Oral argument is scheduled for December 5, 2016.

Natural Gas Litigation (GenOn)       GenOn is party to several lawsuits, certain of which are class action lawsuits, in state and federal courts in Kansas, Missouri, Nevada and Wisconsin.  These lawsuits were filed in the aftermath of the California energy crisis in 2000 and 2001 and the resulting FERC investigations and relate to alleged conduct to increase natural gas prices in violation of state antitrust law and similar laws.  The lawsuits seek treble or punitive damages, restitution and/or expenses.  The lawsuits also name as parties a number of energy companies unaffiliated with NRG.  In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, which was handling four of the five cases, granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed all claims against GenOn in those cases.  The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which reversed the decision of the District Court.  GenOn along with the other defendants in the lawsuit filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeals' decision and the Supreme Court granted the petition. On April 21, 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit s holding that plaintiffs  state antitrust law claims are not field-preempted by the federal Natural Gas Act and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  The Supreme Court left open whether the claims were preempted on the basis of conflict preemption. The Supreme Court directed that the case be remanded to the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada for further proceedings. On March 7, 2016, class plaintiffs filed their motions for class certification.  Defendants filed their briefs in opposition to class plaintiffs' motions for class certification on June 24, 2016.  On December 8, 2016, the court will hear oral argument on several motions, including plaintiffs' motion on class certification.  On May 20, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada heard argument on the defendants' motion for summary judgment in one of the Kansas cases.  On May 24, 2016, the court granted the motion for summary judgment as to the GenOn entity in one of the Kansas cases.   GenOn has agreed to indemnify CenterPoint against certain losses relating to these lawsuits.  
   In September 2012, the State of Nevada Supreme Court, which was handling the remaining case, affirmed dismissal by the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark County, Nevada of all plaintiffs' claims against GenOn.  In February 2013, the plaintiffs in the Nevada case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In June 2013, the Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby ending one of the five lawsuits.  
  Maryland Department of the Environment v. GenOn Chalk Point and GenOn Mid-Atlantic       On January 25, 2013, Food   Water Watch, the Patuxent Riverkeeper and the Potomac Riverkeeper (together, the Citizens Group) sent GenOn Mid-Atlantic a letter alleging that the Chalk Point, Dickerson and Morgantown generating stations were violating the terms of the three National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits by discharging nitrogen and phosphorous in excess of the limits in each permit.  On March 21, 2013, the MDE sent GenOn Mid-Atlantic a similar letter with respect to the Chalk Point and Dickerson generating stations, threatening to sue within 60 days if the generating stations were not brought into compliance.  On June 11, 2013, the Maryland Attorney General on behalf of the MDE filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland alleging violations of the CWA and Maryland environmental laws related to water.  
  In August 2016, the court approved a consent decree to settle the matter. The consent decree requires: (1) improving the wastewater treatment systems at the Chalk Point and Dickerson facilities which was completed in October 2016; (2) completing supplemental environmental projects worth   $1 million  ; and (3) paying a civil penalty of   $1 million  . The Company has improved the wastewater treatment systems at the Chalk Point and Dickerson facilities and paid the civil penalty of   $1 million  .  
  Chapter 11 Proceedings (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation)       In July 2003, and various dates thereafter, the Mirant Debtors filed voluntary petitions in the Bankruptcy Court for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  GenOn Energy Holdings and most of the other Mirant Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on January 3, 2006, when the Plan became effective.  The remaining Mirant Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on various dates in 2007.  Approximately   461,000   of the shares of GenOn Energy Holdings common stock to be distributed under the Plan have not yet been distributed and have been reserved for distribution with respect to claims disputed by the Mirant Debtors that have not been resolved.  Upon the Mirant/RRI Merger, those reserved shares converted into a reserve for approximately   1.3 million   shares of GenOn common stock.  Upon the NRG Merger, those reserved shares converted into a reserve for approximately   159,000   shares of NRG common stock.  Under the terms of the Plan, upon the resolution of such a disputed claim, the claimant will receive the same pro rata distributions of common stock, cash, or both as previously allowed claims, regardless of the price at which the common stock is trading at the time the claim is resolved.  If the aggregate amount of any such payouts results in the number of reserved shares being insufficient, additional shares of common stock may be issued to address the shortfall.  
  Potomac River Environmental Investigation     In March 2013, NRG Potomac River LLC received notice that the District of Columbia Department of Environment (now renamed the Department of Energy and Environment, or DOEE) was investigating potential discharges to the Potomac River originating from the Potomac River Generating station site, a site where the generation station is no longer in operation. In connection with that investigation, DOEE served a civil subpoena on NRG Potomac River LLC requesting information related to the site and potential discharges occurring from the site.  NRG Potomac River LLC provided various responsive materials.  In January 2016, DOEE advised NRG Potomac River LLC that DOEE believed various environmental violations had occurred as a result of discharges DOEE believes occurred to the Potomac River from the Potomac River Generating station site and as a result of associated failures to accurately or sufficiently report such discharges.  DOEE has indicated it believes that penalties are appropriate in light of the violations.  The Registrants are currently reviewing the information provided by DOEE.

Note 11       Regulatory Matters   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  This footnote should be read in conjunction with the complete description under   Note 16  ,   Regulatory Matters  , to the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K. 
  The Registrants operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.  As such, the Registrants are affected by regulatory developments at both the federal and state levels and in the regions in which they operate.  In addition, the Registrants are subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which they participate.  These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact the Registrants' wholesale business. 
  In addition to the regulatory proceeding noted below, the Registrants are parties to other regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or have other regulatory exposure.  In management's opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect the Registrants  respective consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
  PJM Capacity Performance Appeals     On or about July 8, 2016, four petitions were filed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit seeking review of the FERC orders approving PJM s Capacity Performance revisions to its forward capacity market after motions for rehearing at FERC were denied on May 10, 2016.  The Registrants intervened in these matters on July 29, 2016.  Briefing is underway.  This case concerns capacity revenues already received by the Registrants, as well as revenues that would be received in the future. 

Note 12       Environmental Matters   (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  This footnote should be read in conjunction with the complete description under   Note 17  ,   Environmental Matters  , to the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K. 
  The Registrants are subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects.  These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants.  Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent and the Registrants expect this trend to continue.  The electric generation industry is facing new requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species.  In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose certain restrictions on the operations of the Registrants' facilities, which could have a material effect on the Registrants' respective consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards.  In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it.  In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision.  In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards.  Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO   2    budgets for four states and (ii) ozone-season NO   x    budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.  On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NOx allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. The Registrants believe their investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.  
  In February 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units.  The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which limits had to be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension).  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of   Michigan v. EPA  , and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units.  The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. On April 25, 2016, the EPA released a supplemental finding that the benefits of this regulation outweigh the costs to address the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the EPA had not properly considered costs. This finding has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. While the Registrants cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, the Registrants believe that because they have already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, their fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule.  
  
   38 

Water 
  In August 2014,     the EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns.  The Registrants anticipate that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of their water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed.  
  Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination 
  In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. The Registrants have evaluated the impact of the new rule on the Registrants' respective consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and have accrued their environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of September 30, 2016. 
  Environmental Capital Expenditures  
  GenOn estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2016 through 2020 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately   $76 million   for GenOn, which includes   $22 million   for GenOn Americas Generation.  The amount for GenOn Americas Generation includes   $18 million   for GenOn Mid-Atlantic.

  PJM 
  2019/2020 PJM Auction Results     On May 24, 2016, PJM announced the results of its 2019/2020 base residual auction.  GenOn (including GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) cleared approximately 6,766 MW of Capacity Performance product and 305 MW of Base Capacity product in the 2019/2020 base residual auction. GenOn's expected capacity revenues from the 2019/2020 base residual auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year are approximately $260 million. GenOn Americas Generation (including GenOn Mid-Atlantic) cleared approximately 3,814 MW of Capacity Performance product in the 2019/2020 base residual auction.  GenOn Americas Generation's (including GenOn Mid-Atlantic) expected capacity revenues from the 2019/2020 base residual auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year are approximately $140 million.  For results of the 2018/2019 PJM base residual auction, refer to Item 1 -   Business   of the Registrant's 2015 Form 10-K, noting that cleared capacity related to ComEd is related to Aurora which was sold on July 12, 2016.

  PJM Capacity Performance Appeals     On or about July 8, 2016, four petitions were filed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit seeking review of the FERC orders approving PJM s Capacity Performance revisions to its forward capacity market after motions for rehearing at FERC were denied on May 10, 2016.  The Registrants intervened in these matters on July 29, 2016.  Briefing is underway.  This case governs capacity revenues already received by the Registrants, as well as the revenues for forward periods. 
  AEP and FirstEnergy Ohio Contracts     On March 31, 2016, the Public Utility Commission of Ohio, or PUCO, approved two settlements allowing AEP and FirstEnergy to recover costs associated with contracts between their regulated and un-regulated affiliates via a non-bypassable  retail rate rider  that would apply to all retail customers in Ohio.  In anticipation of the approval of the contracts, NRG, along with other companies, participated in three separate complaints at FERC, two questioning whether AEP and FirstEnergy have the regulatory approvals necessary to enter into above-market contracts with their generation affiliates without further FERC review, and one alleging that PJM s tariff is unjust and unreasonable because it does not include provisions to prevent the artificial suppression of prices caused by state-approved out-of-market payments.  On April 27, 2016, FERC granted the complaints against AEP and FirstEnergy, and required AEP and FirstEnergy to file the Ohio PPAs with FERC for further review.  The second complaint against PJM regarding bidding rules remains pending.  
  In response to the FERC order granting the Company s complaint, FirstEnergy filed both an administrative appeal at PUCO and, among other things, proposed an alternative  virtual power purchase agreement , both of which the Company also opposed. On October 12, 2016, PUCO approved an alternative PUCO staff proposal that establishes a grid modernization fund to be paid to the FirstEnergy utilities in Ohio.  While the proposed out of market contracts would have directly impacted the PJM wholesale market, the grid modernization proposal approved by PUCO does not create an explicit subsidy for FirstEnergy s wholesale affiliates.

New England (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation) 
  Winter Reliability Program     On August 8, 2016, FERC issued an order on remand establishing a new proceeding into whether rates charged in the 2013/2014 Winter Reliability Program were just and reasonable.  The Winter Reliability Program paid generators, including GenOn, for certain costs associated with ensuring reliability during the winter period.  The order on remand follows a D.C. Circuit opinion questioning whether FERC had adequately justified its acceptance of ISO-NE's proposed rates.  The order directs ISO-NE to (i) collect information from each market participant on its costs of participating in the program, and (ii) directs ISO-NE to analyze whether the market results were competitive.  On September 19, 2016, GenOn submitted information as requested by the Internal Market Monitor and as instructed by FERC.  Depending on the outcome of the proceeding, FERC could potentially direct refunds of some or all of the revenues earned by GenOn. 
  FCM Rules for 2014 Forward Capacity Auction     On February 28, 2014, ISO-NE filed with FERC the results of Forward Capacity Auction 8. On September 16, 2014, FERC issued a notice stating that the Forward Capacity Auction 8 results would go into effect by operation of law. Several parties requested rehearing of FERC s notice. FERC rejected those requests on legal and procedural grounds. A petition for review of FERC's decision was filed with the D.C. Circuit. The Company, along with other parties, filed a brief in support of FERC. On October 25, 2016, the D.C. Circuit rejected all challenges to the validity of the Forward Capacity Auction 8 results, finding that it had no jurisdiction to review rates allowed to go into effect by operation of law. 
    
  New York 
  FERC Investigation of NYISO RMR Practices     On February 19, 2015, pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA, FERC found NYISO s tariff to be unjust and unreasonable because it did not contain provisions governing the retention of and compensation to generating units for reliability.  FERC ordered NYISO to adopt tariff provisions containing a proposed RMR rate schedule and pro forma RMR agreement.  On October 19, 2015, NYISO filed its tariff revisions at FERC.  NRG protested the filing. On April 21, 2016, FERC rejected in part and accepted in part NYISO s proposed tariff provisions.  Multiple parties filed for rehearing. NYISO made a compliance filing on September 19, 2016, which was protested by a generator trade association. Resolution of this matter will affect how long uneconomic resources must stay in the market before they are allowed to retire, as well as the impact units retained for reliability will have on market prices.   
  New York Clean Energy Standard and Zero-Emissions Credit Nuclear Bailout     On August 1, 2016, the NYSPSC issued its Clean Energy Standard, or CES.  The CES order included three main components: (i) a commitment to move New York to 50% renewables by 2030; (ii) new renewable energy credit pricing for both new and existing renewable facilities; and (iii) a Zero-Emissions Credit, or ZEC, that would provide more than $7.6 billion over 12 years in out-of-market subsidy payments to certain selected nuclear generating units in the state. The stated purpose of the ZECs is to keep nuclear units running even though they would be uneconomic and likely retire if they received compensation only from the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power market.  The ZECs would have the effect of suppressing wholesale market prices and interfere with the wholesale market.  On October 19, 2016, the Company, along with other entities, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the validity of the NYSPSC action and the ZEC program.   
    
  Environmental Matters  
  The Registrants are subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects.  These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants.  Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent and the Registrants expect this trend to continue.  The electric generation industry is facing new requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species.  Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the operations of the Registrants' facilities, which could have a material effect on the Registrants' operations.  Complying with environmental laws involves significant capital and operating expenses.  The Registrants decide to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital. 
  A number of regulations with the potential to affect the Registrants and their facilities are in development, under review or have been recently promulgated by the EPA, including ESPS/NSPS for GHGs, ash disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent guidelines.  The Registrants are currently reviewing the outcome and any resulting impact of recently promulgated regulations and cannot fully predict such impact until legal challenges are resolved. 
  The Registrants' environmental matters are described in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K in Item 1, Business -   Environmental Matters   and Item 1A, Risk Factors.  These matters have been updated in   Note 12  ,     Environmental Matters  , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q as found in Item 1.

Clean Power Plan     The national and international attention (including the Paris Agreement) in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs.  The CPP rule faces numerous legal challenges that likely will take several years to resolve. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sitting   en banc  , heard oral argument on the challenges to the CPP in September 2016.  A decision is expected in the next few months. 
  Changes in Accounting Standards 
  See   Note 2  ,   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  ,   to this Form 10-Q as found in Item 1,     for a discussion of recent accounting developments. 
  Significant Events 
  The following significant events occurred during 2016, as further described within this Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: 
              
    Impairment Losses     During the second quarter of 2016, GenOn recorded impairment losses on its Mandalay and Ormond Beach operating units totaling $59 million.   
                
    Operational Matters     In October 2016, GenOn Americas Generation was given notice that its bid for a resource adequacy contract for 2017 with Pacific Gas   Electric was not accepted for the Pittsburg generating station, or Pittsburg.  As a result, GenOn Americas Generation decided that it would retire Pittsburg on January 1, 2017.  These events were determined to be indicators of impairment and as a result, GenOn Americas Generation will perform an impairment test for Pittsburg under ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment.    Based on the results of the impairment test, GenOn Americas Generation may recognize an impairment loss during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Consolidated Results of Operations  
  The consolidated results of operations is separately presented for GenOn Energy, Inc., GenOn Americas Generation, LLC, and GenOn Mid-Atlantic, LLC, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The following section includes a discussion of electricity prices, gross margin and economic gross margin along with other significant drivers impacting each of the Registrants  results of operations. 
  Electricity Prices 
  The following tables summarize average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which the Registrants operate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Average on-peak power prices decreased primarily due to the decrease in natural gas prices for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  . 

(a) Average on peak power prices based on real time settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs. 
  (b) Region also transacts in PJM - West Hub.

  (b) Region also transacts in PJM - West Hub. 
  The following tables summarize average realized power prices for each Registrant for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which reflects the impact of settled hedges: 

(a) Excludes pass-through amounts for GenOn Energy Management. 
  (b) Excludes closure and financial settlement of certain open positions with counterparties that would have otherwise been realized in subsequent periods.

(a) Excludes pass-through amounts for GenOn Energy Management. 
  (b) Excludes closure and financial settlement of certain open positions with counterparties that would have otherwise been realized in subsequent periods. 
  Though the average on peak power prices have   decreased     23%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , average realized prices for each of the Registrants have decreased at a slower rate year-over-year due to the Registrants' multi-year hedging program and the success of the Registrants' commercial operations team that optimizes the value of the assets on a daily basis. 
    
  Gross Margin  
  The Registrants calculate gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, other costs of sales, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities.   
  Economic Gross Margin 
  In addition to gross margin, the Registrants evaluate their operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies  presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.  Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Registrants' presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin.  The Registrants believe that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Registrants' chief operating decision maker.  Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuel and other cost of sales. 
  The economic gross margin does not include contract and emission credit amortization or mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities.

Mark-to-market for Economic Hedging Activities  
  Mark-to-market for economic hedging activities includes asset-backed hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges.  
  The breakdown of gains and losses included in GenOn's operating revenues and operating costs and expenses are as follows: 

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.  The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $142 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of natural gas contracts as a result of decreases in forward natural gas prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period.  The   $45 million   gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by an increase in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of increases in forward coal prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from coal contracts that settled during the period.   
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $17 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by an increase in the value of forward sales of power contracts as a result of decreases in forward power prices. The   $8 million   loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of decreases in forward coal prices.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $233 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, as well as decreases in the value of new natural gas and power deals executed during the year. The   $45 million   gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from coal contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by decreases in the value of new coal contracts executed during the year.   
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $91 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by an increase in the value of forward sales of power contracts as a result of decreases in forward power prices. The   $67 million   loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of decreases in forward coal prices.  
  
   49 

Operations and Maintenance 
  Operations and maintenance   decreased   by   $18 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower variable operating and maintenance costs resulting from the sale of Seward during the first quarter of 2016, fuel conversion project at Shawville in the current year, as well as lower maintenance due to prior year outages at Bowline and Canal.  
    
  Operations and maintenance   decreased   by   $58 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower variable operating and maintenance costs resulting from less generation in the current year, the sale of Seward during the first quarter of 2016, fuel conversion project at Shawville in 2016, and lower maintenance due to prior year outages at Bowline and Canal. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in environmental expenses primarily at GenOn Mid-Atlantic and higher outage expense at Avon Lake during the current year.  
    
  Other Cost of Operations 
  Other cost of operations   decreased   by   $12 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   and   decreased   by   $24 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to reduction in property tax assessments for the Chalk Point and Dickerson generating stations. 
  Impairment Losses 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an impairment loss of   $59 million   primarily due to impairment of Mandalay and Ormond Beach operating units during the second quarter of 2016. These losses are further described in   Note 6  ,   Impairments  .  
    
  General and administrative expenses   
    
  General and administrative expenses   increased   by   $9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to costs incurred associated with advisors and other creditors engaged to assist GenOn and its creditors with regards to its ability to continue as a going concern as further discussed in   Note 1  ,   Basis of Presentation  . 
    
  Gain on Sale of Assets 
    
  The   $262 million   gain on sale of assets during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the   $74 million   gain on sale of Potrero real property and a   $188 million   gain on sale of the Aurora Generating Station during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  The   $294 million   gain on sale of assets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the   $74 million   gain on sale of Potrero real property and a   $188 million   gain on sale of the Aurora Generating Station during the third quarter of 2016, and a   $29 million   gain on sale of the Shelby Generating Station and a $3 million gain on the sale of an easement of land at Potrero during the first quarter of 2016. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense   decreased   by   $8 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   and   decreased   by   $22 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due to the repurchase of GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
    
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , GenOn incurred tax expense of   $21 million   and   $20 million  , respectively, primarily due to state income taxes associated with the disposition of generating stations during the year.

Mark-to-market for Economic Hedging Activities  
  Mark-to-market for economic hedging activities includes asset-backed hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges.  
  The breakdown of gains and losses included in GenOn Americas Generation's operating revenues and operating costs and expenses are as follows: 

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.  The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $75 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period as well as a decrease in the value of forward purchases of natural gas contracts as a result of decreases in forward natural gas prices.  The   $35 million   gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by an increase in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of increases in forward coal prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from coal contracts that settled during the period. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $4 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, largely offset by an increase in the value of forward sales of power contracts as a result of decreases in forward power prices. The   $9 million   loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of decreases in forward coal prices.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $228 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period. The   $40 million   gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from coal contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by decreases in the value of new coal contracts executed during the year.   
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $84 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by an increase in the value of forward sales of power and natural gas contracts as a result of decreases in forward power and natural gas prices. The   $48 million   loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of decreases in forward coal prices.

Operations and Maintenance 
  Operations and maintenance remained flat for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Operations and maintenance   decreased   by   $19 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   as a result of lower maintenance expense due to prior year outages at Bowline and Canal partially offset by an increase in environmental expenses at GenOn Mid-Atlantic in the current year. 
  Other Cost of Operations 
  Other cost of operations   decreased   by   $9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   and   decreased   by   $21 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a reduction in property tax assessments for the Chalk Point and Dickerson generating stations and the receipt of a favorable property tax settlement in the third quarter of 2016 quarter at the Dickerson generating station for previous tax years.  
  Gain on Sale of Assets 
  The   $74 million   gain on sale of assets during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the gain on the sale of Potrero real property during the third quarter of 2016. 
  The   $77 million   gain on sale of assets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   reflects the   $74 million   gain on the sale of Potrero real property during the third quarter of 2016 and a $3 million gain on the sale of an easement of land at Potrero during the first quarter of 2016. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense   decreased   by   $3 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   and   decreased   by   $9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due to the repurchase of GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Mark-to-market for Economic Hedging Activities  
  Mark-to-market for economic hedging activities includes asset-backed hedges that have not been designated as cash flow hedges.  
  The breakdown of gains and losses included in GenOn Mid-Atlantic's operating revenues and operating costs and expenses are as follows: 

Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.  The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $83 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period as well as a decrease in the value of forward purchases of natural gas contracts as a result of decreases in natural gas prices.  The   $40 million   gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by an increase in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of increases in forward coal prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from coal contracts that settled during the period.   
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $1 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, largely offset by an increase in the value of forward sales of power contracts as a result of decreases in forward power prices. The   $2 million   loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of decreases in forward coal prices.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $203 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period. The   $39 million   gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from coal contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by decreases in value of new coal contracts executed during the year.   
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $29 million   loss in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from electricity and natural gas contracts that settled during the period, partially offset by an increase in the value of forward sales of power and natural gas contracts as a result of decreases in forward power and natural gas prices. The   $42 million   loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was primarily driven by a decrease in the value of forward purchases of fuel contracts as a result of decreases in forward coal prices.  
  
   58 

Operations and Maintenance 
  Operations and maintenance   increased   by   $3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   due to an increase in environmental expenses. 
    
  Operations and maintenance   increased   by   $15 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to increase in environmental expenses and higher variable operation and maintenance costs driven by increased generation in the current year. 
    
  Other Cost of Operations 
  Other cost of operations   decreased   by   $10 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   and   decreased   by   $20 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a reduction in property tax for the Chalk Point and Dickerson generating stations and the receipt of a favorable property tax settlement in the third quarter of 2016 at the Dickerson generating station for previous tax years.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity Position 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Registrants' liquidity was comprised of the following:  

(a)  At   September 30, 2016  , REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic did not satisfy the restricted payment tests under certain of their agreements and therefore, could not use such funds to distribute cash and make other restricted payments. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total liquidity   increased     $624 million   primarily driven by the sales of the Aurora Generating Station and real property at Potrero during the third quarter of 2016 as discussed in   Note 3  ,   Dispositions  , along with the settlement of certain open positions with one of GenOn's counterparties as discussed in   Note 5  ,   Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  . 
  As further described in   Note 1  ,   Basis of Presentation  , management believes that the Registrants' liquidity position and cash flows from operations will not be adequate to finance current operating, maintenance and capital expenditures, debt service obligations and other liquidity commitments.   
   As disclosed in   Note 7  ,   Debt and Capital Leases  , as of September 30, 2016,   $703 million   of GenOn's Senior Notes are current and due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity exclusive of cash subject to the restrictions under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases to repay the senior notes due in June 2017.  As a result of these factors, there is no assurance GenOn will continue as a going concern.  If GenOn cannot continue as a going concern, this may have a material adverse impact on GenOn's liquidity, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  NRG, GenOn s parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to the Registrants other than as described in   Note 9  ,   Related Party Transactions  .  
  GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors and lessors, refinancing the senior notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility of a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During the second quarter of 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors and, during the third quarter of 2016, GenOn retained advisors as part of this process. 
  
   59 

Management continues to regularly monitor the ability of GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic to finance the needs of its long-term operating, financing and investing activities. 
  Restricted Payments Tests 
  Of the   $1.2 billion   of cash and cash equivalents of the Registrants' as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $483 million   and   $110 million   were held by GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA, respectively.  The ability of certain of GenOn s and GenOn Americas Generation s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of certain agreements, including the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases.  Under their respective operating leases, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless:  (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  In addition, prior to making a dividend or other restricted payment, REMA must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing its obligation to pay scheduled rent under its leases.  Based on GenOn Mid-Atlantic s and REMA s most recent calculations of these tests, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA did not satisfy the restricted payments tests.  As a result, as of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA could not make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments.  Each of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA may recalculate its fixed charge coverage ratios from time to time and, subject to compliance with the restricted payments test described above, make dividends or other restricted payments.  GenOn Mid-Atlantic has not been able to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since the quarter ended March 31, 2014 which was the last quarterly period for which GenOn Mid-Atlantic satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement.  REMA has not satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since 2009. 
  To the extent GenOn Mid-Atlantic or REMA are able to pay dividends to GenOn, the GenOn senior notes due 2018 and 2020 and the related indentures also restrict the ability of GenOn to incur additional liens and make certain restricted payments, including dividends.  In the event of a default or if restricted payment tests are not satisfied, GenOn would not be able to distribute cash to its parent, NRG.  At   September 30, 2016  , GenOn did not meet the consolidated debt ratio component of the restricted payments test. 
  Credit Ratings 
  On October 7, 2016, Moody's lowered its corporate credit ratings on GenOn to Caa3 from Caa2 and its probability of default rating to Caa3-PD from Caa2-PD. In addition, Moody's also lowered the ratings of REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic's pass through certificates to Caa1 from B2.  These changes are an update from March 21, 2016, at which time GenOn's corporate credit rating was lowered from B3 to Caa2. At that time, Moody's also lowered the issue level ratings on GenOn Senior Notes from B3 to Caa2 and the GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes from Caa1 to Caa2. 
  On May 24, 2016, S P lowered its corporate credit ratings on GenOn to CCC from CCC+.  The ratings outlook for GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA is negative.  S P also lowered the issue-level ratings on the GenOn Senior Notes to CCC+ from B-, the GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes to CCC from CCC+, and the pass-through certificates at REMA to B- from B.  S P upgraded the rating on the pass-through certificates at GenOn Mid-Atlantic to B- from CCC+.   
  The following table summarizes the Registrants' credit ratings of its senior notes as of   September 30, 2016  :

Sources of Liquidity 
  The principal sources of liquidity for the Registrants' future operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, cash proceeds from future sales of assets and the intercompany revolving credit agreement with NRG, described more fully in   Note 9  ,   Related Party Transactions  .  The Registrants' operating cash flows may be affected by, among other things, demand for electricity, the difference between the cost of fuel used to generate electricity and the market value of the electricity generated, commodity prices (including prices for electricity, emissions allowances, natural gas, coal and oil), operations and maintenance expenses in the ordinary course, planned and unplanned outages, terms with trade creditors, cash requirements for capital expenditures relating to certain facilities (including those necessary to comply with environmental regulations) and the potential impact of future environmental regulations. 
  Asset Dispositions 
   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, GenOn received proceeds of $118 million related to the sale of its Seward and Shelby Generating Stations during the first quarter, proceeds of $369 million related to the sale of GenOn's Aurora Generating Station during the third quarter and proceeds of $76 million related to the sale of an easement of land and of real property located at Potrero during the first and third quarter of 2016. 
  Uses of Liquidity 
  The Registrants' requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) debt service obligations; (ii) capital expenditures, including maintenance and environmental; and (iii) payments under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  The following table and description summarizes the Registrant's capital expenditures for maintenance, environmental, and fuel conversions/additions for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and currently estimated capital expenditures forecast for the remainder of   2016  . 

Operating Leases 
  GenOn, through its subsidiary REMA, leases a 100% interest in the Shawville generating station through 2026 and leases 16.45% and 16.67% interests in the KeyStone and Conemaugh coal generation stations, respectively, through 2034.  In addition, GenOn Mid-Atlantic leases a 100% interest in the Dickerson and Morgantown coal generation stations and associate property through 2029 and 2034, respectively.  GenOn and GenOn Mid-Atlantic account for these leases as operating leases and records rent lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of each respective lease.  Annual rent expense for the REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic operating leases is $40 million and $71 million, respectively.  As a result of acquisition accounting, REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic recognized out-of-market liabilities related to these operating leases of $790 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis to rent expense.  Amortization of the out-of-market liabilities amortized annually by REMA and GenOn Mid-Atlantic is $11 million and $28 million, respectively.

  ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Registrants  management, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Registrants conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  Based on this evaluation, the Registrants  principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in the Registrants  internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the   third quarter   of   2016   that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants  internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION    
   
  Item 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  For a discussion of material legal proceedings in which the Registrants were involved through   September 30, 2016  , see   Note 10  ,   Commitments and Contingencies  ,   to this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Item 1A   RISK FACTORS (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic) 
  Information regarding risk factors appears in Part I, Item 1A,   Risk Factors,   in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K.  Except as presented below, there have been no material changes in the Registrants' risk factors since those reported in the Registrants'   2015   Form 10-K.   
  There is no assurance GenOn will continue as a going concern.  
  GenOn s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming GenOn will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As such, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts, or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should GenOn be unable to continue as a going concern.  Such adjustments could have a material adverse impact on GenOn results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  As disclosed in   Note 7  ,   Debt and Capital Leases  ,   to this Form 10-Q, as of September 30, 2016, $703 million of GenOn's Senior Notes outstanding are current within the GenOn consolidated balance sheet and are due on June 15, 2017.  GenOn's future profitability continues to be adversely affected by (i) a sustained decline in natural gas prices and its resulting effect on wholesale power prices and capacity prices, and (ii) the inability of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments to GenOn.  Based on current projections, GenOn is not expected to have sufficient liquidity exclusive of cash subject to the restrictions under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA operating leases to repay the senior notes due in June 2017.  As a result of these factors, there is no assurance GenOn will continue as a going concern.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , GenOn has cash and cash equivalents of   $1.2 billion  , of which   $483 million   and   $110 million   is held by GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA, respectively.  Under their respective operating leases, GenOn Mid-Atlantic and REMA are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless: (a) they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period for four fiscal quarters; (b) they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made; and (c) no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Additionally, REMA must be in compliance with the requirement to provide credit support to the owner lessors securing its obligation to pay scheduled rent under its lease.  As a result, GenOn Mid-Atlantic has not been able to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since the quarter ended March 31, 2014 which was the last quarterly period for which GenOn Mid-Atlantic satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement.  REMA has not satisfied the conditions under its operating agreement to make distributions of cash and certain other restricted payments since 2009. 
  NRG, GenOn's parent company, has no obligation to provide any financial support to the Registrants other than as described in   Note 9  ,   Related Party Transactions  . 
  GenOn is currently considering all options available to it, including negotiations with creditors and lessors, refinancing the senior notes, potential sales of certain generating assets as well as the possibility for a need to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  During the second quarter of 2016, GenOn appointed two independent directors and, during the third quarter of 2016, GenOn retained advisors as part of this process.

The Registrants are exposed to possible losses that may occur from the failure to maintain counterparties or the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement, particularly in connection with non-collateralized power hedges with financial institutions. 
    
          Failure of the Registrants to maintain counterparties or the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement may result in losses to the Registrants.  Specifically, GenOn Mid-Atlantic's credit exposures on power and gas hedges with financial institutions in excess of applicable collateral thresholds are senior unsecured obligations of such counterparties. Deterioration in the financial condition of such counterparties could result in their failure to pay amounts owed to GenOn Mid-Atlantic or to perform obligations or services owed to GenOn Mid-Atlantic beyond collateral posted. In addition, the Registrants may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of the Registrants  hedging activities.
