Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of S P Global Inc. 
    
  We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of S P Global Inc. (and subsidiaries) (the  Company ) as of   September 30, 2016  , the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the related statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the related consolidated statement of equity for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016  . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of S P Global Inc. (and subsidiaries) as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein) and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated February 11, 2016.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

1. 
    Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation 
       
  S P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "S P Global," the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.  
    
  On April 27, 2016, we changed our name to S P Global Inc. from McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. 
    
  Our operations consist of   four   reportable segments: S P Global Ratings, S P Global Market Intelligence, S P Dow Jones Indices ("S P DJ Indices") and S P Global Platts.  
             
    S P Global Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and market participants.  
                
    S P Global Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research, and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services. 
                
    S P DJ Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. 
                
    S P Global Platts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets. As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in S P Global Platts through that date. 
       
  The S P Global Ratings segment includes S P Global Ratings, which is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO"), as well as CRISIL, a global analytical company incorporated in India, and certain other ratings-related businesses. 
    
  In February of 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Standard   Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc. ("SPSE") and Credit Market Analysis ("CMA"),   two   businesses within our S P Global Market Intelligence segment, to Intercontinental Exchange. As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of SPSE and CMA as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. In October of 2016, we completed the sale of SPSE and CMA to Intercontinental Exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services.  
    
  In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power, included within our S P Global Platts segment, for   $1.1 billion   to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D. Power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. During three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of   $722 million   (  $521 million   after-tax) in gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of J.D. Power. Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of J.D. Power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, the financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (our  Form 10-K ). Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current presentation. 
    
  In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods have been included. The operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 
    
  Our critical accounting estimates are disclosed in Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , in our Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets,  
  
   9 

pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Since the date of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.

Divestitures  
    
  In February of 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell SPSE and CMA,   two   businesses within our S P Global Market Intelligence segment, to Intercontinental Exchange.  As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of SPSE and CMA as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. In October of 2016, we completed the sale of SPSE and CMA to Intercontinental Exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services. 
    
  In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power, included within our S P Global Platts segment, for   $1.1 billion   to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D. Power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of   $722 million   (  $521 million   after-tax) in gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of J.D. Power. Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of J.D. Power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a pre-tax gain of   $11 million   in gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment. 
    
  The components of assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets consist of the following: 

The operating profit of our businesses that were disposed of or held for sale for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

3. 
    Income Taxes 
       
  The effective income tax rate was   29.5%   and   25.9%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was due to the favorable resolution of tax audits in 2015, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on the disposition of J.D. Power in 2016. The effective tax rate was   30.6%   and   30.7%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant, unusual or extraordinary items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect, and are individually computed, is recognized in the interim period in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. 

11 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits was   $121 million   and   $120 million  , respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $40 million   and   $31 million  , respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. 
    
  Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may significantly decrease in the next twelve months. Although the ultimate resolution of our tax audits is unpredictable, the resulting change in our unrecognized tax benefits could have a material impact on our results of operations and/or cash flows. 

2   
    Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total   $2 million  . 
               3   
    Interest payments are due semiannually on February 14 and August 14, and as of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total   $5 million  . 
               4   
    Interest payments are due semiannually on June 15 and December 15, and as of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total   $9 million  . 
               5   
    Interest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total   $9 million  . 
                7   
    Interest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total   $4 million  . 
       
  The fair value of our long-term debt borrowings was   $4.3 billion   and   $3.6 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices. 
    
  On September 22, 2016, we issued   $500 million   of   2.95%   senior notes due in 2027. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard   Poor's Financial Services LLC. We used the net proceeds to fund the   $400 million   early repayment of our    5.9%   senior notes due in 2017 on October 20, 2016, and intend to use the balance for general corporate purposes. 
    
  We have the ability to borrow a total of   $1.2 billion   through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving   $1.2 billion   five-year credit agreement (our  credit facility ) that we entered into on June 30, 2015. This credit facility will terminate on June 30, 2020. There were   no   commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . Commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of   December 31, 2015   totaled   $143 million   with an average interest rate and term of   0.95%   and   17 days  , respectively. 

12 

Depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, we pay a commitment fee of   10   to   20   basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. We currently pay a commitment fee of   15   basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate.  
    
  Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than   4   to   1  , and this covenant level has never been exceeded. 

5. 
    Derivative Instruments 
       
  Cash Flow Hedges 
    
  Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our Indian Rupee exposure through the fourth quarter of 2016. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs and are scheduled to mature at the end of each quarter during 2016. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedge contract matures. As of September 30, 2016, we estimate that   $2 million   of the net gains related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. There was no hedge ineffectiveness for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was   $78 million   and   $59 million  , respectively. 
  The following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

1   
    We use the income approach to measure the fair value of our forward currency forward contracts. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on observable inputs such as forward rates, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

The activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the periods ended   September 30  : 

6. 
    Employee Benefits 
       
  We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued. 
    
  We have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor voluntary 401(k) plans under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts. 
    
  We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active and retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans. 
    
  We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic benefit (credit) cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.   
    
  The components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost for our retirement plans and postretirement plans for the periods ended   September 30   are as follows:    
    
  Retirement Plans 

14 

Postretirement Plans 

As discussed in our Form 10-K, we changed certain discount rate assumptions and our expected return on assets assumption for our retirement plans, which became effective on January 1, 2016. In addition, at the end of 2015, we changed our approach used to measure service and interest costs on all of our retirement plans. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. For 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. We also updated the assumed mortality rates to reflect life expectancy improvements. The effect of the assumption changes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted in a decrease in net periodic benefit cost of approximately   $5 million   and   $15 million  , respectively. 
    
  In the first nine months of   2016  , we contributed   $6 million   to our retirement plans and expect to make additional required contributions of approximately   $2 million   to our retirement plans during the remainder of the year. We may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status in the fourth quarter of   2016  . 

7. 
    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  We issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees and Directors under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan permits the granting of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. 
    
  Stock-based compensation for the periods ended   September 30   is as follows: 

1   
    There were a minimal amount of stock options granted in 2015. During 2015, the Company stopped granting stock options. 
       
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   0.6 million   shares of restricted stock and unit awards, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of   $100.31   per share. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and unit awards as of   September 30, 2016   was   $65 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.8 years  .  

Stock Repurchases 
    
  On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of   50 million   shares, which was approximately   18%   of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.   
    
  In any period, share repurchase transactions could result in timing differences between the recognition of those repurchases and their settlement for cash. This could result in a difference between the cash used for financing activities related to common stock repurchased and the comparable change in equity.  

15 

Share repurchases for the periods ended   September 30   were as follows:    

1   
    The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include shares received as part of our accelerated share repurchase agreement described in more detail below. 
               2   
    Average price paid per share information does not include the accelerated share repurchase transaction as discussed in more detail below. 
               3   
    In December of 2015,   0.3 million   shares were repurchased for approximately   $26 million  , which settled in January of 2016. Cash used for financing activities only reflects those shares which settled during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting in   $1,123 million   of cash used to repurchase shares. 
     Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   26.6 million   shares remained available under the current share repurchase program which has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. 
    
  Accelerated Share Repurchase Program 
    
  Using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of J.D. Power, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with a financial institution on September 7, 2016 to initiate share repurchases aggregating   $750 million  . The ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid   $750 million   and received an initial delivery of approximately   4.4 million   shares and an additional amount of   0.9 million   shares during the month of September 2016, representing the minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR agreement will be based on the volume weighted-average share price, minus a discount, of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. This price is capped such that only under limited circumstances will we be required to deliver shares or, at our election, pay cash at settlement. Additionally, depending on the average share price through the completion date, we may receive additional shares under the ASR agreement. The final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement is expected to be completed no later than the first quarter of 2017. The ASR agreement was executed under the current share repurchase program, approved on December 4, 2013.  
    
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  The agreement with the minority partners of our S P Dow Jones Indices LLC contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S P Dow Jones Indices LLC, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ("CGIS") will have the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least   20%   of their share in S P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the   15   days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest. 
    
  If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption  Redeemable noncontrolling interest  with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, considering a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, long-term growth rates, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. 
    
  Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.  

16 

Changes to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

1   
    See Note 6         Employee Benefits   for additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings. 
               2   
    See Note 5         Derivative Instruments   for additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings. 
       
  The net actuarial loss and prior service cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans included in other comprehensive income is net of a tax provision of   $4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

9. 
    Earnings Per Share 
       
  Basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted performance shares calculated using the treasury stock method.  

17 

The calculation for basic and diluted EPS for the periods ended   September 30   is as follows:    

We have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   stock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstanding of   0.7 million   and   0.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded. 

During 2016 and 2015, we continued to evaluate our cost structure and further identified cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure and our decision to exit non-strategic businesses. Our 2016 and 2015 restructuring plans consisted of a workforce reduction of approximately   100   and   550   positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for the restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed. 
    
  The initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of   September 30, 2016   by segment is as follows: 

We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of   $17 million   for the 2016 restructuring plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and have reduced the reserve for the 2016 restructuring plan by   $4 million  . The ending reserve balance for the 2015 restructuring plan was   $50 million   as of December 31, 2015. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we have reduced the reserve for the 2015 restructuring plan by   $27 million  .

    Segment and Related Information 
       
  We have   four   reportable segments: S P Global Ratings, S P Global Market Intelligence, S P DJ Indices and S P Global Platts. Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit. Segment operating profit does not include unallocated expense or interest expense as these are costs that do not affect the operating results of our segments.  
    
  Changes to Organizational Structure 
    
  The segment amounts and discussions included in this Form 10-Q reflect the reportable segments that existed through the end of the third quarter of 2016. Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer will evaluate the performance of these segments. As a result, as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016, S P Global Market Intelligence and S P Global Platts will be combined into a single reportable segment, Market and Commodities Intelligence. These changes do not impact the constituent components of our S P Global Ratings and S P DJ Indices reportable segments. We will begin reporting the financial results of the combined segment in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
    
  A summary of operating results by segment for the periods ended   September 30   is as follows:    

1   
    Operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily includes a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of   $17 million   and   $63 million  , respectively. Operating profit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes legal settlement charges partially offset by a benefit related to legal settlement insurance recoveries of   $86 million   and   $40 million  , respectively. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include restructuring charges of   $6 million   and   $8 million  , respectively. Operating profit also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of   $1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and   $4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
               2   
    Operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes disposition-related costs of   $5 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, and an acquisition-related cost of   $1 million  .

             4   
    As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in S P Global Platts results through that date. Operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a gain on the sale of J.D. Power of   $722 million  . Additionally, disposition-related costs of   $1 million   and   $5 million   are included for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 31, 2015 includes restructuring charges of   $1 million  . Operating profit also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of   $3 million   and   $9 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $5 million   and   $11 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  Related Party Agreements 
    
  In June of 2012, we entered into a new license agreement (the "License Agreement") with the holder of S P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, which replaced the 2005 license agreement between S P DJ Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , S P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned   $18 million   and   $58 million  , respectively, of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the   27%   noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  
    
  Legal   Regulatory Matters 
    
  In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of S P Global Ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. 

20 

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the pending claims and potential claims in the matters described below and is diligently pursuing these defenses, and in some cases working to reach an acceptable negotiated resolution. However, in view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of these matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters described below will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. 
    
  S P Global Ratings 
    
    Financial Crisis Litigation 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries continue to defend civil cases brought by private and public plaintiffs arising out of ratings activities prior to and during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Discovery in certain of these cases is ongoing. We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable. At this time, however, we are unable to reasonably estimate the range of such additional amounts, if any. 
    
  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
    
  As a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, S P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S P Global Ratings seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not seek remedies against S P Global Ratings for one or more compliance deficiencies. 
    
  Trani Prosecutorial Proceeding 
    
  The prosecutor in the Italian city of Trani has obtained criminal indictments against several current and former S P Global Ratings managers and ratings analysts for alleged market manipulation, and against Standard   Poor s Credit Market Services Europe under Italy s vicarious liability statute, for having allegedly failed to properly supervise the ratings analysts and prevent them from committing market manipulation. The prosecutor s theories are based on various actions by S P Global Ratings taken with respect to Italian sovereign debt between May of 2011 and January of 2012. Trial commenced in February of 2015 and is ongoing. Apart from criminal penalties that might be imposed following a conviction, such conviction could also lead to civil damages claims and other sanctions against Standard   Poor s Credit Market Services Europe or the Company. Such claims and sanctions cannot be quantified at this stage. 
    
  Shareholder Derivative Actions 
    
  In August of 2015,   two   purported shareholders commenced a putative derivative action on behalf of the Company in New York State Supreme Court titled Retirement Plan for General Employees of the City of North Miami Beach and Robin Stein v. Harold McGraw III, et al. The complaint asserts claims for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and mismanagement against the board of directors, certain former directors of the Company, and   three   former S P Global Ratings employees. Plaintiffs seek recovery from the defendants based primarily on allegations that S P Global Ratings  credit ratings practices for certain residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations misrepresented the credit risks of those securities, allegedly resulting in losses to the Company. The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint in October of 2015. Plaintiffs filed an opposition in December of 2015, and the Company and the individual defendants filed their reply briefs in January of 2016.  
    
  In January of 2016, a different purported shareholder commenced a separate putative derivative action on behalf of the Company in New York State Supreme Court titled L.A. Grika v. Harold McGraw III, et al.  The allegations in the complaint are substantially similar to those in the North Miami Beach matter described above.  The complaint asserts claims for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, contribution and indemnification against Harold McGraw III, Douglas L. Peterson, and   nine   former S P Global Ratings employees. The case was transferred to the judge presiding over the North Miami Beach action.  The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the Grika complaint in May of 2016. Plaintiffs filed an opposition in June of 2016, and the Company and the individual defendants filed their reply briefs in July of 2016. 
  
   21 

The court notified the parties in August of 2016 that it will be issuing written decisions on the outstanding motions to dismiss without oral argument.    

13. 
    Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards 
       
  In August of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance providing amendments to eight specific statement of cash flows classification issues. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February of 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities but will recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January of 2016, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November of 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September of 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify the accounting  for measurement-period adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February of 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January of 2015, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the concept of reporting extraordinary items, but retains current presentation and disclosure requirements for an event or transaction that is of an unusual nature or of a type that indicates infrequency of occurrence. Transactions that meet both criteria would now also follow such presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August of 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. This guidance is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May of 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued jointly a converged standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, which is intended to improve the financial reporting of revenue and comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The core principle of the new standard is for the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the payment to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will also result in enhanced revenue disclosures, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multiple-element

arrangements. In August of 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Subsequently, the FASB issued implementation guidance related to the new revenue standard, including the following: In March of 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; in April of 2016, the FASB clarified guidance on performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; in May of 2016, the FASB issued a practical expedient in response to identified implementation issues. While we will continue with our evaluation process, initially, we believe this guidance may have an impact on the accounting for certain proprietary consulting arrangements in our S P Global Platts segment as well as the accounting for certain integrated desktop service revenue arrangements offered in our S P Global Market Intelligence segment.

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.  
    
  On April 27, 2016, we changed our name to S P Global Inc. from McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. 
    
  Our operations consist of four reportable segments: S P Global Ratings, S P Global Market Intelligence, S P Dow Jones Indices ("S P DJ Indices") and S P Global Platts.  
             
    S P Global Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors, issuers and market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. 
                
    S P Global Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research, and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services. 
                
    S P DJ Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. 
                
    S P Global Platts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets. As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in S P Global Platts results through that date.  
       
  The S P Global Ratings segment includes S P Global Ratings, which is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO"), as well as CRISIL, a global analytical company incorporated in India, and certain other ratings-related businesses. 
    
  In February of 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Standard   Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc. ("SPSE") and Credit Market Analysis ("CMA"), two businesses within our S P Global Market Intelligence segment, to Intercontinental Exchange. As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of SPSE and CMA as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. In October of 2016, we completed the sale of SPSE and CMA to Intercontinental Exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services.

In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power, included within our S P Global Platts segment, for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D. Power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $722 million ($521 million after-tax) in gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of J.D. Power.  Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of J.D. Power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Key results for the periods ended   September 30   are as follows:

    Operating profit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes net legal settlement insurance recoveries of $17 million and $63 million, respectively, disposition-related costs of $6 million and $17 million, respectively, an acquisition-related cost of $1 million, and a gain on the sale of J.D. Power of $722 million. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a technology related impairment charge of $24 million, restructuring charges of $6 million, and a $3 million disposition-related reserve release. Operating profit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes legal settlement charges partially offset by a benefit related to legal settlement insurance recoveries of $86 million and $40 million, respectively, and acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of $32 million. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes an $11 million gain related to the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment and restructuring charges of $22 million. Operating profit also includes amortization of intangibles of   $23 million   and   $71 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $17 million   and   $40 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
       
  Three Months 
    
  Revenue increased   9%   driven by increases at S P Global Market Intelligence, S P Global Ratings and S P DJ Indices, partially offset by a decrease at S P Global Platts. S P Global Platts was unfavorably impacted by the sale of J.D. Power on September 7, 2016. Revenue growth at S P Global Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of SNL Financial ("SNL") in September of 2015 and annualized contract value growth primarily driven by the S P Capital IQ Desktop, Global Risk Services and certain data feed products. The increase at S P Global Ratings was primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and U.S. bank loan ratings revenue. Revenue growth at S P DJ Indices was primarily due to higher levels of assets under management ("AUM") for ETFs and mutual funds and an increase in data revenue. Continued demand for Platts  proprietary content at S P Global Platts also contributed to revenue growth in the quarter.  
    
  Operating profit increased 229%. Excluding the favorable impact of the gain on the sale of J.D. Power of 181 percentage points, higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 26 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 8 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and disposition-related costs of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 17%. This increase was primarily due to revenue growth as discussed above and decreased costs at our legacy Capital IQ business due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions. 
    
  Nine Months    
    
  Revenue increased   8%   driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. Revenue growth at S P Global Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015 and annualized contract value growth primarily driven by the S P Capital IQ Desktop, Global Risk Services and certain data feed products. The revenue increase at S P Global Platts was primarily driven by continued demand for Platts  proprietary content, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the sale of J.D. Power on September 7, 2016. Revenue growth at S P Global Ratings was driven by a increase in U.S. bank loan ratings  
  
   32 

revenue, partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenue. Revenue growth at S P DJ Indices was primarily due to higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives, higher levels of AUM for mutual funds and an increase in data revenue. 
    
  Operating profit increased   68%  . Excluding the favorable impact of the gain on the sale of J.D. Power of 49 percentage points, higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 7 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a technology related impairment charge of 2 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and higher disposition-related costs of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 14%. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth as discussed above. Decreased costs at S P Global Ratings and our legacy Capital IQ business due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions also contributed to operating profit growth.  
    
     Our Strategy 
    
  We are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Our purpose is to provide the intelligence that is essential for companies, governments and individuals to make decisions with conviction. We seek to deliver on this purpose within the framework of our core values of integrity, excellence and relevance. 
    
  There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses.

Revenue 
    
  The following table provides consolidated revenue information for the periods ended   September 30  :    

Three Months 
    
  Subscription / non-transaction revenue increased   9%   primarily from the favorable impact of  the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015 and growth in S P Global Market Intelligence's average contract values driven by an expansion in new and existing accounts as well as continued demand for Platts  proprietary content. Asset linked fees increased 10% due to the impact of higher AUM for ETFs and mutual funds. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased   7%   primarily due to an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue and U.S. bank loan ratings revenue at S P Global Ratings, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the sale of J.D. Power on September 7, 2016 at S P Global Platts. See  Segment Review  below for further information.

  Operating Profit 
  We consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate.  
  We internally manage our operations by reference to  segment operating profit  with economic resources allocated primarily based on segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before unallocated expense. Segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance. Segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. 
  Changes to Organizational Structure 
    
  The segment amounts and discussions included in this Form 10-Q reflect the reportable segments that existed through the end of the third quarter of 2016. Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer will evaluate the performance of these segments. As a result, as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016, S P Global Market Intelligence and S P Global Platts will be combined into a single reportable segment, Market and Commodities Intelligence. These changes do not impact our the constituent components of our S P Global Ratings and S P DJ Indices reportable segments. We will begin reporting the financial results of the combined segment in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

  Unallocated Expense         These expenses, included in selling and general expenses, mainly include costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space. Unallocated expense decreased $7 million or   21%   as compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease in the quarter is primarily due to a reduction in professional service fees. 
    
  Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 2 percentage points. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.

Unallocated expense decreased   1%   as compared to the first nine months of   2015  . Excluding the unfavorable impact of a gain on the sale of a non-core investment in 2015 of 11 percentage points, partially  
  
   38 

offset by the favorable impact of a disposition-related reserve release of 3 percentage points and higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 1 percentage points, unallocated expense decreased 8% due to a reduction in professional service fees. 
    
  Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 2 percentage points. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.  
    
  Interest Expense, net 
    
  Net interest expense increased compared to the   third   quarter and first nine months of   2015   primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to our senior notes issued in 2015. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The effective income tax rate was   29.5%   and   25.9%   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was due to the favorable resolution of tax audits in 2015, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on the disposition of J.D. Power in 2016. The effective tax rate was   30.6%   and   30.7%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 

Segment Review 
    
  S P Global Ratings 
    
  Credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the debt issue may default. 
    
  S P Global Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with: 
             
    ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments; 
                
    bank loan ratings; and 
                
    corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an S P Global Ratings credit rating. 
       
  Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to S P Global Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data by S P Global Ratings. Royalty revenue was   $23 million   and   $68 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $21 million   and   $61 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  

39 

The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the periods ended   September 30  :    

1   
    Operating profit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries partially offset by legal settlement charges of $17 million and $63 million, respectively. Operating profit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes legal settlement charges partially offset by a benefit related to legal settlement insurance recoveries of $86 million and $40 million, respectively. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes restructuring charges of $6 million and $8 million, respectively. Operating profit also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of   $1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and   $4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
       
  Three Months 
    
  Revenue increased   9%  , which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue grew primarily due to an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue across all regions and growth in U.S. bank loan ratings revenue driven largely by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment. Revenue growth benefited from increased contract realization. Non-transaction revenue remained unchanged as an increase in surveillance fees was offset by a decline in Ratings Evaluation Service ("RES") activity. 
    
  Operating profit increased   78%  . Excluding the favorable impact of higher net insurance recoveries in 2016 of 61 percentage points, operating profit increased 17%. This increase is primarily due to revenue growth. Expenses increased slightly due to higher compensation costs related to additional headcount and increased incentive costs. Increased expense was partially offset by decreased costs related to the 2015 implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform of the Consumer Protection Act and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of less than one percentage point. 
    
  Nine Months 
    
  Revenue increased   1%  , which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in U.S. bank loan ratings revenue largely driven by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenue. Revenue growth benefited from increased contract realization. Non-transaction revenue grew primarily due to an increase in surveillance fees, partially offset by a decline in RES activity. 

40 

Operating profit increased   19%  . Excluding the favorable impact of higher net insurance recoveries in 2016 of 13 percentage points, operating profit increased 6%. The increase is due to expense reduction as well as revenue growth. Reduced expenses were primarily driven by decreased costs related to the 2015 implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform of the Consumer Protection Act, reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters and lower incentive costs. These increases were partially offset by higher compensation costs related to additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of one percentage point. 
    
  Issuance Volumes 
    
  We monitor issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within S P Global Ratings. Issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer. Issuance volumes can be reported in two ways: by  domicile  which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located, or based on  marketplace  which is where the bonds are sold. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year, based on a composite of Thomson Financial, Harrison Scott Publications, Dealogic and S P Global Ratings' internal estimates. 

High-yield issuance in the U.S. and Europe was up for the quarter as a result of more favorable market conditions due to tightening credit spreads. Decreases in high-yield issuance in the year-to-date period reflects weakness in the first half of the year due to market volatility and political and economic uncertainty in the European markets. High par value investment-grade issuance deals but lower volumes continued this quarter.  

ABS issuance in the U.S. was up in the quarter driven by an increase in credit card and non-traditional transactions. 
                
    Issuance was down in the U.S. Structured Credit markets driven by lower availability of leveraged loans. Issuance was up in the European Structured Credit markets driven by new CLO engagements. 
                
    CMBS issuance in the U.S. was down in the quarter and year-to-date reflecting fewer conduit fusion transactions and overall market volatility. European CMBS issuance was up in the quarter, although from a low 2015 base. 
                
    RMBS volume in the U.S. was up slightly and European RMBS volume was down in the quarter driven primarily by one large issuance in the third quarter of 2015.  
                
    Covered bond issuance (which are debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) in Europe was down in the quarter due to the impact of central bank lending policies.

N/M - not meaningful 
    
            1   
    Operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes disposition-related costs of $5 million and $12 million, respectively, and an acquisition-related cost of $1 million. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include a technology related impairment charge of $24 million. Additionally, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of $32 million, and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 include restructuring charges of $12 million. Operating profit also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of   $18 million   and   $54 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $10 million   and   $21 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
       
  Three Months 
    
  Revenue increased   21%   and was favorably impacted by 14 percentage points from the acquisition of SNL. Excluding the acquisition of SNL, revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in annualized contract values in the S P Capital IQ Desktop, RatingsXpress  and RatingsDirect  from new and existing customers. Increases in annualized contract value for certain of our data feed products also contributed to revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by declines in the equity research business. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. The number of users on the S P Capital IQ Desktop and the number of customers at RatingsXpress  continued to grow in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenue increased, with international revenue representing 32% of S P Global Market Intelligence's total revenue. International revenue growth was primarily driven by sales growth of the S P Capital IQ Desktop and RatingsXpress in Europe and Asia, and the favorable impact of the acquisition of SNL. 

42 

Operating profit increased 112%. Excluding the favorable impact of higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 114 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of disposition-related costs of 17 percentage points and the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions 28 percentage points, operating profit increased 43%. This increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 2 percentage points, partially offset by higher compensation costs and increased technology costs as a result of the acquisition of SNL. Excluding the acquisition of SNL, expenses decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 driven by lower compensation costs primarily due to a reduction in headcount and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 
    
  Nine Months 
    
  Revenue increased   25%   and was favorably impacted by 18  percentage points from the acquisition of SNL. Excluding the acquisition of SNL, revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in annualized contract values in the S P Capital IQ Desktop, RatingsXpress  and RatingsDirect  from new and existing customers. Increases in annualized contract value for certain of our data feed products also contributed to revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by declines in the equity research business. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. The number of users on the S P Capital IQ Desktop and the number of customers at RatingsXpress  continued to grow in the first nine months of the year. Both domestic and international revenue across all regions increased, with international revenue representing  32% of S P Global Market Intelligence's total revenue. International revenue growth across all regions was primarily driven by sales growth of the S P Capital IQ Desktop and RatingsXpress in Europe and Asia, and the favorable impact of the acquisition of SNL. 
    
  Operating profit increased   60%  . Excluding the unfavorable impact of amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 6 percentage points, a technology related impairment charge of 5 percentage points and disposition-related costs of 2 percentage points, partially offset by favorable impact of higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 6 percentage points and higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 55%. This increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 6 percentage points, partially offset by higher compensation costs and increased technology costs as a result of the acquisition of SNL. Excluding the acquisition of SNL, expenses decreased compared to the first nine months of 2015 driven by lower compensation costs primarily due to a reduction in headcount and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. 
    
  In February of 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell SPSE and CMA, two businesses within our S P Global Market Intelligence segment, to Intercontinental Exchange. As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of SPSE and CMA as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. In October of 2016, we completed the sale of SPSE and CMA to Intercontinental Exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services.

43 

The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the periods ended   September 30  :    

Three Months 
    
  Revenue at S P DJ Indices increased   6%  , primarily driven by higher levels of assets under management ("AUM") for ETFs and mutual funds and an increase in data revenue, partially offset by lower volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. Additionally, mutual fund revenue benefited from a retroactive revision to contract fees in the quarter. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by less than 1 percentage point. 
    
  Ending AUM for ETFs in the   third   quarter of   2016   increased 22% to $914 billion and average AUM for ETFs increased 15% to $903 billion compared to the   third   quarter of 2015.  
    
  Operating profit grew   1%  . Excluding the impact of amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions of less than 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 1%. Revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates was partially offset by higher compensation costs related to additional headcount and increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at S P DJ Indices. Foreign exchange rates had an favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point. 
    
  Nine Months 
    
  Revenue at S P DJ Indices increased   5%  , primarily driven by higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives, an increase in data revenue and higher levels of AUM for mutual funds. Additionally, mutual fund revenue benefited from a retroactive revision to contract fees. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower average levels of AUMs for ETFs in the first quarter of 2016. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. 

44 

Operating profit grew   4%  . Excluding amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 3%. Revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates was partially offset by higher compensation costs related to additional headcount and increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at S P DJ Indices.

S P Global Platts 
    
  S P Global Platts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodities and energy markets. The S P Global Platts business is driven by the need for high-value information and transparency in a variety of industries. S P Global Platts seeks to deliver premier content that is deeply embedded in customer workflows and decision making processes. 
    
  In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power, included within our S P Global Platts segment, for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D. Power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $722 million ($521 million after-tax) in gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of J.D. Power. Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of J.D. Power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  S P Global Platts' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources: 
             
    Subscription revenue       subscriptions to our real-time news, market data and price assessments, along with other information products, primarily serving the energy and the automotive industries; and 
                
    Non-subscription revenue       primarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges, syndicated and proprietary research studies, commercial-oriented data and analytics, conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, and events.    
       
  As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in S P Global Platts results through that date. Prior to the sale, S P Global Platts included the brands Platts and J.D. Power.

million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $5 million   and   $11 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  Three Months 
    
  Revenue decreased   8%   as a result of the sale of J.D. Power. This decrease was partially offset by revenue growth at Platts primarily due to continued demand for Platts' market data and price assessment products, led by petroleum product offerings. Platts' revenue was also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of PIRA Energy Group and RigData in September of 2016 and June of 2016, respectively.  
    
  Operating profit increased 778%. Excluding the favorable impact of the gain on the sale of J.D. Power of 780 percentage points and the favorable impact of amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of disposition costs of 1 percentage point, operating profit decreased 4% due to the sale of J.D. Power on September 7, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by revenue growth at Platts and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 6 percentage points, partially offset by higher compensation costs at Platts primarily related to additional headcount from acquisitions. 
    
  Nine Months 
    
  Revenue grew   4%   primarily due to continued demand for Platts  proprietary content. This growth was driven mainly by continued demand for Platts  market data and price assessment products, led by petroleum product offerings. Additionally, growth has been driven by the continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges. Platts' revenue was also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of PIRA Energy Group and RigData in September of 2016 and June of 2016, respectively, and Petromedia Ltd and its operating subsidiaries in July of 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease as a result of the sale of J.D. Power on September 7, 2016. 
    
  Operating profit increased 280%. Excluding the favorable impact of the gain on the sale of J.D. Power of 273 percentage points and the favorable impact of amortization of intangibles of 1 percentage point, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of disposition costs of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 8%. This increase is primarily due to revenue growth at Platts and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 3 percentage points, partially offset by higher compensation costs at Platts primarily related to additional headcount from acquisitions.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses. Cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure. 
    
  Cash Flow Overview 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $2,399 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $918 million   from   December 31, 2015  , and consisted of approximately 30% of domestic cash and 70% of cash held abroad. Typically, cash held outside the U.S. is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the U.S., as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years is expected to be abroad. In the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the U.S. to repatriate these funds. 
    
  The following table provides cash flow information for the   nine   months ended   September 30  :    

N/M - not meaningful 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , free cash flow increased to   $1,045 million   compared to   $(497) million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase is primarily due to the increase in cash provided by (used for) operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities less capital  
  
   46 

expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items. 
    
  Operating activities 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $1,171 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to cash used for operating activities of   $356 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015. 
    
  Investing activities     
    
  Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions. 
    
  Cash provided by investing activities increased to   $858 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to cash used for investing activities of   $2,456 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power of $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to cash used for the acquisition of SNL of $2.2 billion in 2015. See Note 2         Acquisitions and Divestitures   for further discussion. 
    
  Financing activities 
    
  Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
    
  Cash used for financing activities was   $1,018 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   as compared to cash provided by financing activities of   $1,927 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the $2.0 billion and $700 million issuances of senior notes in the third quarter of 2015 and second quarter of 2015, respectively, and an increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2016. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we used cash to repurchase   9.1 million   shares for   $1,123 million  . In December of 2015, we purchased 0.3 million shares for approximately $26 million, which settled in January of 2016. During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we used cash to repurchase   4.9 million   shares for   $501 million  . Using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of J.D. Power, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with a financial institution on September 7, 2016 to initiate share repurchases aggregating   $750 million  . See Note 8         Equity   for further discussion. 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  Cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations of $129 million in the first nine months of 2015 relates to the tax payment on the gain on sale of McGraw Hill Construction which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
    
  Additional Financing 
    
  We have the ability to borrow a total of   $1.2 billion   through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving   $1.2 billion   five-year credit agreement (our  credit facility ) that we entered into on June 30, 2015. This credit facility will terminate on June 30, 2020. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . Commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of   December 31, 2015   totaled   $143 million   with an average interest rate and term 0.95% and 17 days, respectively. 
    
  Depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, we pay a commitment fee of   10   to   20   basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. We currently pay a commitment fee of   15   basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate.  
    
  Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than   4   to   1  , and this covenant level has never been exceeded.  
  
   47 

Dividends 
    
  On January 27, 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.33 per share to $0.36 per share.

  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. Additionally, we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow, which are included in the table below. 
    
  We believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase stock and fund ongoing operational and working capital needs. 
    
  The presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below for the   nine   months ended   September 30  :    

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  Our accounting policies are described in Note 1         Accounting Policies   to the consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , in our Form 10-K, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. These critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable non-controlling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Since the date of our Form 10-K, there have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 5 -   Derivative Instruments   to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed so that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Interim Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
    
  See Note 12     Commitments and Contingencies - Legal   Regulatory Matters   to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for information on our legal proceedings. 

Item 1a.     Risk Factors 
    
  Our Form 10-K contains detailed cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or expected results. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our Form 10-K. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors we have previously disclosed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, in our Form 10-K. 
  Regulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following the United Kingdom s likely exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
             
    Following a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"), it is expected that the U.K. government will initiate a process to leave the EU (often referred to as Brexit) and begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the EU.   

Any impact from Brexit on the Company will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade and other negotiations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the U.K and the EU as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and the EU determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the U.K.  Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in Europe.  Potential changes in EU regulation and/or additional regulation in the U.K. could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses. 

Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares, which was approximately 18% of the Company's outstanding shares at that time. During the   third   quarter of   2016  , we repurchased   5.3 million   shares and, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   26.6 million   shares remained under our current repurchase program. 
    
  Using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of J.D. Power, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with a financial institution on September 7, 2016 to initiate share repurchases aggregating   $750 million  . The ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid   $750 million   and received an initial delivery of approximately   4.4 million   shares and an additional amount of   0.9 million   shares during the month of September 2016, representing the minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the ASR agreement will be based on the volume weighted-average share price, minus a discount, of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. This price is capped such that only under limited circumstances will we be required to deliver shares or, at our election, pay cash at settlement. Additionally, depending on the average share price through the completion date, we may receive additional shares under the ASR agreement. The final settlement of the transaction under the ASR agreement is expected to be completed no later than the first quarter of 2017. The ASR agreement was executed under the current share repurchase program, approved on December 4, 2013.  
    
  Repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. The 2013 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. 
    
  The following table provides information on our purchases of our outstanding common stock during the   third   quarter of   2016   pursuant to our current share repurchase program (column c). In addition to these purchases, the number of shares in column (a) include shares of common stock that are tendered to us to satisfy our employees  tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of restricted shares (we repurchase such shares based on their fair market value on the vesting date). There were no other share repurchases during the quarter outside the repurchases noted below.

  Item 5.     Other Information 
    
  IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT DISCLOSURE 
    
  Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether, during the reporting period, it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
    
  Revenue during the third quarter of 2016 attributable to the transactions or dealings by the Company described below was approximately $211,000, with net profit from such sales being a fraction of the revenues. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, one of the Company s divisions, a provider of energy-related information in over 150 countries, sold information and informational materials, which are generally exempt from U.S. economic sanctions, to fourteen subscribers that  are owned or controlled, or appear to be owned or controlled, by the Government of Iran (the  GOI ).  The Company, among other things, offers customers that subscribe to its publications access to proprietary data, analytics, and industry information that enable commodities markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency.  This division provided such data related to the energy and petrochemicals markets to the subscribers referenced above, generating revenue that was a de minimis portion of both the division's and the Company s revenue.  Eight of the subscribers are designated by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control as GOI entities and six appear, based on publicly available information, to be owned or controlled by GOI entities.  We believe that these transactions were permissible under U.S. sanctions pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions for the exportation of information and informational materials.  The Company will continue to monitor its provision of products and services to these Iranian customers so that such activity continues to be permissible under U.S. sanctions.

S P GLOBAL INC. 
  KEY EXECUTIVE SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN 
    
  S P Global Inc. (   SPGI   ), a corporation existing under the laws of the State of New York, has established and adopted the Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the    Plan   ) to provide annual incentive awards to key employees of the Company, including, in the case of executive officers and certain other key executives of the Company, awards which are intended to qualify as  performance-based compensation  within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.  The Plan is amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2016. 
  1.        PURPOSES OF THE PLAN 
  The purposes of the Plan are to provide the opportunity for incentives and financial rewards to key employees of the Company designated by the Committee, who, because of the extent of their responsibilities, can make significant contributions to the Company s performance by their ability, industry, loyalty, leadership and individual achievement.  Providing recognition and financial rewards to such individuals based on the performance of the Company and their contributions will advance the interests of SPGI and its shareholders and will assist the Company in attracting and retaining management of the highest caliber and ability.

For purposes of determining a Participant s Change-in-Control Award Payment, if the Participant did not participate in a short-term incentive plan of the Company during one or more of the preceding three Years, such average shall be deemed to be equal to the Participant s Award Payment (or other short-term incentive award payment) or the average of the Participant s Award Payments (or other payments), as applicable, for such Year or Years in which the Participant participated in the Plan (or other short-term incentive award plan).  If any such Award Payment (or other short-term incentive award payment) was reduced because the Participant commenced employment with the Company after the start of the applicable Year, then the amount of such Award Payment (or other payment) shall be annualized for purposes of determining such average.  If the Participant did not participate in a short-term incentive plan of the Company during the preceding three Years, then the Participant s Change-in-Control Award Payment shall be equal to (x) the Participant s annual base salary, multiplied by (y) the average of the Change-in-Control Award Payments to be paid to the other Participants at the same grade level and in a similar business unit as the Participant (or, in the case of a Covered Participant, the other Covered Participants) as a result of the Change in Control, divided by (z) the average of such other Participants  (or Covered Participants ) annual base salaries.

At or near the start of the applicable Year, the Committee shall: (i) determine the number of Pools for the Year; (ii) specify the relevant Performance Objectives for each Pool; (iii) identify the Participants eligible to receive a share of each Pool, the Individual Bonus Target for each such Participant and specify the Individual Performance Criteria under their Awards; and (iv) determine the target amount of each Pool.  During the applicable Year, the Committee shall have discretion to adjust the target or actual amount of each Pool to reflect changes in the employment status of Participants during the Year and to adjust the actual amount of one or more Pools to take account of Award Payments in respect of Covered Awards allocated to such Pool. 
    
  4.2.  Notice  .  Each Participant shall be notified at or near the beginning of the applicable Year of the amount of his or her Individual Bonus Target.  The Committee shall determine for each Year the time and manner of notice to Participants of Awards. 
    
  4.3.  Determination of Pools and Payment  .  As soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of each Year, the Committee shall determine the actual amount of each Pool, based on the attainment of the applicable Performance Objectives for such Pool for such Year.  Seventy percent of each Pool, in the case of Participants with a grade level of 20 or above, or fifty percent of each Pool, in the case  

-   7   - 

of Participants with a grade level of less than 20, shall be allocated to the Participants therein in proportion to each Participant s Individual Bonus Target, and the amount so allocated to a Participant shall constitute the Participant s Individual Formula Amount for the Year;   provided  ,   however  , that no portion of such 70% or 50%, respectively, of the Pool shall be allocated to any Participant whose performance rating for the year is  Underperforming, requires improvement  (or equivalent designation), with the result that any such Participant s Individual Formula Amount shall be zero. The remaining 30% or 50%, as applicable, of each Pool shall be allocated to Participants therein based on the their attainment of the applicable Individual Performance Criteria for the Year;   provided  ,   however  , that no portion of such 30% or 50%, respectively, of the Pool shall be allocated to any Participant whose performance rating for the year is  Underperforming, requires improvement  (or equivalent designation), with the result that any such Participant s Individual Performance Amount shall be zero.  Each Award Payment shall, subject to any deferral required or permitted by the Committee, be paid to the Participant in cash, stock awards under a shareholder-approved stock plan of the Company, or any combination thereof at such time as is determined by the Committee in its sole discretion following the end of the applicable Year, but no more than 90 days following the date of the report of SPGI s independent auditors certifying SPGI s financial statements for the Year. 
    
  4.4.  Performance Measures  .  Performance Objectives may consist of financial objectives, non-financial objectives or a combination of financial and non-financial objectives.  If more than one Pool is established for a Year, such Pools may have the same or different Performance Objectives.  Individual Performance Criteria may consist of financial objectives, non-financial objectives or a combination of financial and non-financial objectives and may include objective and subjective measures of individual performance, including the results of a Participant s individual performance evaluation by the Company.  Except in the case of the determination of Net Income under Covered Awards, the Committee in its sole discretion shall have the authority to alter or adjust financial objectives during the course of any Year, or to alter or adjust the financial results otherwise reported or achieved by SPGI during such Year, if it is deemed appropriate to do so. 
    
  4.5.  Termination of Employment.     
    
  (a)      If a Participant s employment with the Company terminates during any Year because of a termination by the Company other than for Cause and the Participant is not Retirement Eligible (as defined in Section 4.5(b) below) on the effective date of the termination of employment, then the Participant, subject to the Participant executing a general release of claims against the Company in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, shall receive a Termination Award Payment for the portion of the Year during which the Participant was employed by the Company and participating in the Plan.  Unless the Committee specifies an earlier payment date, such Termination Award Payment shall be made at the time that Award Payments for the applicable Year are made to other Participants.  
  (b)    If a Participant s employment with the Company terminates during any Year because of (i) death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) a termination by the Company other than for Cause and the Participant is Retirement Eligible on the date of the termination of employment, then the Participant (or in the event of death, the Participant s Beneficiary), subject to the Participant executing (or in the event of death, the Participant s Beneficiary) a general release of claims against the Company in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, shall be eligible to receive a Pro Rata Actual Award Payment (as defined below) for the portion of the Year during which the Participant was employed by the Company and participating in the Plan.  Unless the Committee specifies an earlier payment date, such Pro Rata Actual Award Payment shall be made at the time that Award Payments for the applicable Year are made to other Participants.  For purposes of this Section 4.5(b),    Retirement Eligible    means  

-   8   - 

eligible as of the date of the Participant s termination of employment (as shown on the books and records of the Company) for Normal Retirement or, with the approval of the Committee, Early Retirement.  Solely for purposes of this Section 4.5(b),    Pro Rata Actual Award Payment    means an amount determined by multiplying X by Y:  where  X  equals the actual Award Payment for an Award that a Participant would have received if the Participant had remained continuously employed by the Company through the Award payment date, determined on the basis of the achievement of performance measures for the Year and as adjusted in the Committee s discretion for any applicable subjective or objective performance measures applicable to the Award or the Participant; and  Y  equals a fraction, the numerator is the number of whole calendar days in the portion of the Year during which the Participant was employed by the Company and participating in the Plan  and the denominator is 365.  Notwithstanding the above, if the Award is a Covered Award, in no event shall the amount of the Award Payment payable under this Section 4.5(b) exceed the percentage of Net Income set forth in Section 5.2 for the Covered Award. 
       (c)    A Participant whose employment with the Company terminates during a Year or prior to the payment date for Cause, or who voluntarily resigns during a Year or prior to the payment date, shall not be eligible for any payment under the Plan for such Year.  Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.  A leave of absence, approved by the Committee, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan, and may warrant a full Award Payment or Termination Award Payment as determined by the Committee. 
  4.6.  Transfer  .  If a Participant is transferred within the Company during any Year to a position that is not considered as eligible for participation in the Plan, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, authorize a Termination Award Payment to the Participant, based on the portion of the Year during which the Participant was participating in the Plan, and the degree to which during the Year the applicable Performance Objectives and Individual Performance Criteria were achieved during the Year. 
  4.7.  Change in Control.    In the event of a Change in Control, then: 
  (a)    Immediately after such event becomes effective (the    Change-in-Control Effective Date   ), the Company shall pay to each Participant for the Year in which the Change in Control occurs a Change-in-Control Award Payment for the portion of the Year elapsed to the Change-in-Control Effective Date, and shall have no further obligation under the Participant s Award with respect to the Year.  If the Committee so determines, the Company may also pay to each Participant an additional amount, if any, to reflect the achievement during the portion of the Year elapsed to the Change-in-Control Effective Date of the Performance Objectives for the Pool applicable to the Participant s Award and of the Individual Performance Criteria under the Award. 
  (b)    The reasonable legal fees incurred by any Participant to enforce his/her valid rights under this Section 4.7 shall be reimbursed by SPGI, in addition to sums otherwise due under the Plan, whether or not the Participant is successful in enforcing his/her rights or whether or not the matter is settled.  Such reimbursement shall be made on a  pay-as-you-go  basis, as soon as practicable after presentation to SPGI of any periodic statements for such fees. 
  (c)       Change in Control    means any of the following events: 
  (i)    An acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a    Person   ) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of either (1) the then outstanding shares of
