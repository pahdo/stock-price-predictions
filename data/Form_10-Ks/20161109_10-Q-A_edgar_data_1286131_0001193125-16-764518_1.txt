   Explanatory Note   
 We are filing this Amendment No. 1 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q (  Form 10-Q/A  ) for the period ended March 31, 2016,
which was originally filed on May 9, 2016 (  Original Filing  ), to restate the Partnership s consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, as
well as the related notes included in the Original Filing ( Restatement ).    This Form 10-Q/A contains only Item 1 (Financial
Statements), Item 2 (Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), Item 4 (Controls and Procedures) of Part I and Item 6 (Exhibits) of Part II, and items including information not affected by the
Restatement have not been repeated in this Form 10-Q/A.    The Restatement corrects accounting errors related to:  

1) 
 The allocation of net loss to the General Partner and the limited partners for the purposes of determining the general partner s and limited partners  capital accounts presented within  Partners 
capital,  and the corresponding effect on  net loss per limited partner unit (basic and diluted)  for both of the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015;    

2) 
 The presentation of certain components of  Cemetery property ,  Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation ,  Deferred cemetery revenues, net ,  Merchandise
liability ,  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and  Common limited partners  interest  as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015;    

3) 
 The presentation of  Cemetery merchandise revenues , Cemetery service revenues , and  Cost of goods sold  related to assumed performance obligations from acquisitions for both of the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015;       

4) 
 The recording of incorrect amounts of investment revenues and expenses related to merchandise and perpetual care trusts on the consolidated statement of operations and the incorrect tracking of perpetual care-trusting
obligations on the consolidated balance sheets;        

5) 
 The recognition of incorrect amounts of revenue from deferred pre-acquisition contracts in the consolidated statements of operations based on inaccurate system inputs;    

6) 
 Other adjustments principally relating to the recognition, accuracy and/or classification of certain amounts in  Deferred cemetery revenues, net ,  Merchandise liabilities , and  Other current
assets  and        

7) 
 The corresponding effect of the foregoing accounting errors on the Partnership s income tax accounts, consolidated statement of partners  capital, consolidated statement of cash flows, and the related notes
thereto, disclosed in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 included in  Item 1   Financial Statements (unaudited)  to this Form
10-Q/A.      Note 2,  Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements,  in the Partnership s
consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 provides further information regarding the Restatement.  Item 4   Controls and Procedures  to this Form 10-Q/A discloses the material weaknesses in the Partnership s internal
controls associated with the Restatement, as well as management s conclusion that the Partnership s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016. As disclosed therein, management
is currently evaluating the changes needed in the Partnership s internal controls over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses.  
 This Form 10-Q/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Filing and does not substantively modify or
update the disclosures therein other than as required to reflect the adjustments described above and to state our current address of principal executive offices on the cover page of Form 10-Q/A. See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, set forth in Item 1 of this  Form 10-Q/A,  for additional information.    We are also
filing currently dated certifications from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1, and 32.2 to this Form 10-Q/A.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  March 31, 2016   
  (Unaudited)       
     Nature of Operations    
 StoneMor Partners L.P. (the  Partnership ) is a provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in
the United States. As of March 31, 2016, the Partnership operated 307 cemeteries in 27 states and Puerto Rico, of which 276 are owned and 31 are operated under lease, management or operating agreements. The Partnership also owned and operated
104 funeral homes in 19 states and Puerto Rico.      Basis of Presentation    
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which are unaudited except for the balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which is derived
from audited financial statements, are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim reporting. They do not include all disclosures
normally made in financial statements contained in Form 10-K. In management s opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnership s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
disclosed have been made. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto presented in Amendment No. 1 to the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain amounts in the prior year s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 may
not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending December 31, 2016.      Principles of Consolidation
     The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries.
These statements also include the accounts of the merchandise and perpetual care trusts in which the Partnership has a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. The Partnership operates 31 cemeteries under long-term lease, operating or
management contracts. The operations of 16 of these managed cemeteries have been consolidated.    The Partnership operates 15 cemeteries
under long-term leases and other agreements that do not qualify as acquisitions for accounting purposes. As a result, the Partnership did not consolidate all of the existing assets and liabilities related to these cemeteries. The Partnership has
consolidated the existing assets and liabilities of the merchandise and perpetual care trusts associated with these cemeteries as variable interest entities since the Partnership controls and receives the benefits and absorbs any losses from
operating these trusts. Under the long-term leases, and other agreements associated with these properties, which are subject to certain termination provisions, the Partnership is the exclusive operator of these cemeteries and earns revenues related
to sales of merchandise, services, and interment rights, and incurs expenses related to such sales, including the maintenance and upkeep of these cemeteries. Upon termination of these contracts, the Partnership will retain all of the benefits and
related contractual obligations incurred from sales generated during the contract period. The Partnership has also recognized the existing performance obligations that it assumed as part of these agreements.  
   New Accounting Pronouncements      In
the second quarter of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition
requirements in  Topic 605 - Revenue Recognition  and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. During the third quarter of 2015, Update No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  was
released, deferring the effective date of the amendments to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted, only as of an annual reporting

period beginning after December 15, 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, Update No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  was released, which clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. During the second quarter of 2016, Update No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  was released, which clarifies the implementation guidance on
identifying performance obligations. The Partnership will adopt the requirements of these updates upon the effective date of January 1, 2018, and is evaluating the potential impact of the adoption on its financial position, results of operations or
related disclosures.    In the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments (Subtopic
825-10)  ( ASU  2016-01 ). The  core principle of ASU 2016-01 is that equity investments should be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net
income. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted for the key aspects of the amendment. The
Partnership will adopt the requirements of ASU 2016-01 upon its effective date of January 1, 2018, and is evaluating the potential impact of the adoption on its financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.  
 In the first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Update No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The core
principle of ASU 2016-02 is that all leases create an asset and a liability for lessees and recognition of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease
liabilities to be recognized for most leases. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Partnership
plans to adopt the requirements of ASU 2016-02 upon its effective date of January 1, 2019, and is evaluating the potential impact of the adoption on its financial position, results of operations and related disclosures.  
  Use of Estimates     The preparation of the
Partnership s unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. The Partnership s unaudited consolidated financial statements are based on a
number of significant estimates, including revenue and expense accruals, depreciation and amortization, merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts asset valuation, allowance for cancellations, unit-based compensation, deferred contract revenues,
deferred merchandise trust investment earnings, deferred selling and obtaining costs, assets and liabilities obtained via business combinations and income taxes. As a result, actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Net Income (Loss) per Common Unit     Basic
net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per unit is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners, which is determined after the deduction of the general partner s interest, by the weighted
average number of common limited partner units outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners is determined by deducting net income attributable to participating securities, if applicable and net income
(loss) attributable to the general partner s units. The general partner s interest in net income (loss) is calculated on a quarterly basis based upon its units and incentive distributions to be distributed for the quarter, with a priority
allocation of net income to the general partner s incentive distributions, if any, in accordance with the partnership agreement, and the remaining net income (loss) allocated with respect to the general partner s and limited partners 
ownership interests.    The Partnership presents net income (loss) per unit under the two-class method for master limited partnerships,
which considers whether the incentive distributions of a master limited partnership represent a participating security when considered in the calculation of earnings per unit under the two-class method. The two-class method considers whether the
partnership agreement contains any contractual limitations concerning distributions to the incentive distribution rights that would impact the amount of earnings to allocate to the incentive distribution rights for each reporting period. If
distributions are contractually limited to the incentive distribution rights  share of currently designated available cash for distributions as defined under the partnership agreement, undistributed earnings in excess of available cash should
not be allocated to the incentive distribution rights. Under the two-class method, management of the Partnership believes the partnership agreement contractually limits cash distributions to available cash; therefore, undistributed earnings in
excess of available cash are not allocated to the incentive distribution rights.

  The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) allocated to the common limited partners
for purposes of calculating net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per unit (in thousands, except unit data):      
   Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per
unit is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners, less income allocable to participating securities, by the sum of the weighted average number of common limited partner units outstanding and the dilutive
effect of unit appreciation rights and other awards, as calculated by the treasury stock or if converted methods, as applicable. These awards consist of common units issuable upon payment of an exercise price by the participant under the terms of
the Partnership s long-term incentive plan (see Note 13).    The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the
Partnership s weighted average number of common limited partner units used to compute basic net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per unit with those used to compute diluted net income (loss) attributable to common limited
partners per unit (in thousands):      

2.  
  RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       Subsequent to the
issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined that material adjustments were needed to correct certain accounting errors. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
of the Partnership as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related notes hereto, have been restated to correct these accounting errors (the  Restatement ). A summary of these accounting
errors, and their effect on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements is as follows:      

A. 
 The Partnership allocates net loss to the General Partner and its limited partners for the purposes of determining the General Partner s and limited partners  capital accounts within  Partners 
capital , and to calculate net loss per limited partner unit (basic and diluted). However, the historical allocation of the Partnership s net losses did not appropriately consider available cash that had been (or will be) distributed to
the separate class of nonvoting limited partner interest (the incentive distribution rights) held by the General Partner. While this misallocation had no impact on the Partnership s consolidated net loss for the three months ended March 31,
2016 and 2015, the revised calculation to correctly allocate net losses increased the limited partners  historical share of allocated net loss and decreased the General Partner s historical share of allocated net loss. As a result, the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of partners  capital have been restated to increase the limited partners  share of allocated net loss and decrease the General Partner s share of allocated
net loss by approximately $1.2 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated statement of partner s capital has also been restated to decrease the limited
partners  share of partners  capital, and increase the General Partner s share of partners  capital by approximately $11.3 million and $10.2 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    

B. 
 The Partnership had historically presented the cost component of its performance obligations as a liability referred to as  Merchandise liability  and the offset for these liabilities was recognized as a
reduction in  Deferred cemetery revenues, net  in the Partnership s consolidated balance sheet. However, subsequent to the issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined
that the correct presentation of these obligations is  Deferred revenues , rather than a separate  Merchandise liability . Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, has
been restated to reclassify merchandise liabilities of approximately $172.0 million and $173.1 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from  Merchandise liability  to  Deferred revenue . The Partnership
restated its financial statement line item presentation of  Deferred cemetery revenues, net  to  Deferred revenues . Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 has been
restated to reclassify approximately $659.7 million and $637.5 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from  Deferred cemetery revenue, net  to  Deferred revenue .    
      7  

Table of Contents  

C. 
 The Partnership had historically presented revenue related to assumed obligations from acquisitions on a net basis in the Partnership s consolidated statement of operations. However, subsequent to the issuance of
the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined that the correct presentation of this revenue was on a gross basis. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations has been restated
to present such revenue on a gross basis. This classification resulted in an increase in  Cemetery merchandise revenues  of approximately $0.8 million and $1.1 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
increases in  Cemetery services revenue  of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million and an increase  Cost of goods sold  of approximately $1.0 million and $1.3 million for three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.        

D. 
 The Partnership had historically recorded funeral home land from acquisitions within  Cemetery Property . However, subsequent to the issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31,
2016, the Partnership determined that such Funeral home land should be recorded within  Property and equipment . This adjustment resulted in a decrease of $11.6 million and $11.8 million in  Cemetery property  as of March 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and a corresponding increase in  Property and equipment . Additionally, the Partnership had historically recorded deferred cemetery property within  Deferred cemetery revenues, net .
However, subsequent to the issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined that such amounts should have been recorded within  Cemetery property . This adjustment resulted in an
increase in  Cemetery property  in the amount of $3.7 million and $3.6 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.        

E. 
 The Partnership had historically recorded the obligation for certain of the Partnership s outstanding phantom unit awards as liabilities. However, subsequent to the issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for
the period ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined that these awards are equity awards and should be classified as equity. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, has been
restated to adjust the awards as equity award, resulting in a $1.9 million increase to  Common limited partners  interest  and a decrease for the same amount to  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities  as of March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015.        

F. 
 The Partnership had historically recognized incorrect amounts of investment revenues and expenses related to its merchandise and perpetual care trusts on its consolidated statement of operations and was incorrectly
tracking its perpetual care-trusting obligations on its consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three months ended March 31,
2016 and 2015 have been restated for these adjustments. The adjustments resulted in an increase in  Deferred revenues  of approximately $18.3 million and $17.9 million, a decrease in  Partners  Capital  of approximately
$26.0 million and $25.4 million, and an increase in  Other long-term liabilities  of approximately $7.7 million and $7.5 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, the correction of these
accounting errors resulted in an increase in  Cost of goods sold  of $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    

G 
 The Partnership had historically recognized incorrect amounts of revenue from deferred pre-acquisition contracts in its consolidated statement of operations based on inaccurate system inputs. However, subsequent to the
issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined that revenue recognition on such pre-acquisition revenue was understated. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 have been restated to reflect the correction of the system inputs. The adjustments resulted in a decrease in  Deferred revenues  and an increase in  Partners  capital 
of $16.5 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and an increase in  Cemetery merchandise revenues  of $0.4 million and an increase in  Cemetery services revenues  of $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31,
2015.

 Remaining adjustments principally relate to the recognition, accuracy and/or classification of certain amounts in  Deferred cemetery revenues, net ,  Merchandise liabilities , and  Other current
assets , determined subsequent to the issuance of the Partnership s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for the
three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 have been restated for these adjustments. The adjustments resulted in a decrease of $2.7 million and a decrease of $1.9 million in  Deferred revenues  as of March 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively, an increase in  Cemetery merchandise revenues  of $1.0 million and $1.0 million, an increase in  Cemetery services revenues  of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, and an increase in  Cost of goods sold 
of $0.6 million and $1.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.        

I. 
 The Partnership calculated the effect on income taxes associated with the foregoing accounting errors and, as such,  Income tax benefit (expense)  within consolidated statement of operations was restated by
$0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and the  Deferred tax liability  within the consolidated balance sheets are restated by approximately $0.1 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    
    The effect of these adjustments on the Partnership s
consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, partners  capital and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, and as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is summarized below for each affected caption:

  ACQUISITIONS         2015 Acquisitions    
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership acquired the following properties and related assets, net of certain assumed
liabilities:      

Three funeral homes and one cemetery for cash consideration of $5.7 million on August 6, 2015;        

One funeral home for cash consideration of $5.0 million on August 31, 2015, and an additional $1.0 million paid in five annual installments beginning on the 1 st

  The Partnership accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of
accounting. Accordingly, the Partnership evaluated the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values. All other costs incurred associated with the acquisition of the assets noted were
expensed as incurred. The following table presents the Partnership s values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions, based on their estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisition, which may be
prospectively adjusted as additional information is received (in thousands):     
   The Partnership recorded goodwill of $1.1 million and $9.9 million in the Cemetery and Funeral Home reporting
units, respectively, with regard to the properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015.    The following data presents pro
forma revenues, net income (loss) and basic and diluted net income (loss) per unit for the Partnership as if the acquisitions consummated during the year ended December 31, 2015 had occurred as of January 1, 2015. The Partnership prepared these

  MERCHANDISE TRUSTS       At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership s
merchandise trusts consisted of investments in debt and equity marketable securities and cash equivalents, both directly as well as through mutual and investment funds. Certain assets acquired in connection with the Partnership s 2015
acquisitions (see Note 3) are based upon preliminary estimated values assigned to the assets by the Partnership at the date of acquisition, and will be adjusted when additional information is received.

  All of these investments are classified as Available for Sale and accordingly, all of the assets
are carried at fair value. All of these investments are considered either Level 1 or Level 2 assets pursuant to the three-level hierarchy (see Note 15). There were no Level 3 assets.  
 The merchandise trusts are variable interest entities (VIE) for which the Partnership is the primary beneficiary. The assets held in the
merchandise trusts are required to be used to purchase the merchandise and provide the services to which they relate. If the value of these assets falls below the cost of purchasing such merchandise and providing such services, the Partnership may
be required to fund this shortfall.    The Partnership included $8.2 million of investments held in trust by the West Virginia Funeral
Directors Association at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in its merchandise trust assets. As required by law, the Partnership deposits a portion of certain funeral merchandise sales in West Virginia into a trust that is held by the West
Virginia Funeral Directors Association. These trusts are recognized at their account value, which approximates fair value.    A
reconciliation of the Partnership s merchandise trust activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 is presented below (in thousands):      
   During the three months ended March 31, 2016, purchases and sales of securities available for sale included in

market value recovery for these securities.      Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Trust Assets    
 The Partnership assesses its merchandise trust assets for other-than-temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis. During the
three months ended March 31, 2016, the Partnership determined that there were no other than temporary impairments to the investment portfolio in the merchandise trusts. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Partnership determined
that there were two securities with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $0.6 million and an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.4 million, resulting in an impairment of $0.2 million, wherein such impairment was considered to be
other-than-temporary. Accordingly, the Partnership adjusted the cost basis of these assets to their current value and offset this change against deferred revenues. This reduction in deferred revenues will be reflected in earnings in future periods
as the underlying merchandise is delivered or the underlying service is performed.      

8.  
  PERPETUAL CARE TRUSTS       At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership s
perpetual care trusts consisted of investments in debt and equity marketable securities and cash equivalents, both directly as well as through mutual and investment funds. Certain assets acquired in connection with the Partnership s 2015
acquisitions (see Note 3) are based upon preliminary estimated values assigned to the assets by the Partnership at the date of acquisition, and will be adjusted when additional information is received.  
 All of these investments are classified as Available for Sale and accordingly, all of the assets are carried at fair value. All of these
investments are considered either Level 1 or Level 2 assets pursuant to the three-level hierarchy (see Note 15). There were no Level 3 assets. The perpetual care trusts are VIEs for which the Partnership is the primary beneficiary.

  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS         Goodwill    
 The Partnership has recorded goodwill of approximately $69.9 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This amount represents the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.    The Partnership tests goodwill for impairment at
each year end by comparing its reporting units  estimated fair values to carrying values. There were no goodwill impairments recognized by the Partnership during the periods presented. Management will continue to evaluate goodwill at least
annually or when impairment indicators arise.      Intangible Assets    
 The Partnership has intangible assets with finite lives recognized in connection with acquisitions and long-term lease, management and
operating agreements. The Partnership amortizes these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.

   Total debt consists of the following at the dates indicated (in

     Credit Facility    
 The Partnership is a party to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the  Credit Agreement ) which provides
for a single revolving credit facility of $180.0 million (the  Credit Facility ) maturing on December 19, 2019. Additionally the Credit Agreement provides for an uncommitted ability to increase the Credit Facility by an additional
$70.0 million. The Partnership s obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, excluding those held in trust. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either
acquisition draws or working capital draws. Acquisition draws may be utilized to finance permitted acquisitions, the purchase and construction of mausoleums and related costs or the net amount of merchandise trust deposits. Working capital
draws may be utilized to finance working capital requirements, capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. The amount of the Credit Facility that is available for working capital draws is subject to a borrowing formula equal to
85% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined within the Credit Agreement. At March 31, 2016, the amount available under the Credit Facility for working capital advances under this limit was $140.1 million, of which $106.5 million was outstanding
at March 31, 2016.    Each individual acquisition draw is subject to equal quarterly amortization of the principal amount, with annual
principal payments comprised of ten percent of the related advance amount, commencing on the second anniversary of  
      18  

Table of Contents  

such advance, with the remaining principal due on December 19, 2019, subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements. Up to $10.0 million of the Credit Facility may be in the form of standby
letters of credit, of which there were none outstanding at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
interest, at the Partnership s election, at either an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin between 2.25% and 4.00% per annum or the base rate (which is the higher of the bank s prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 0.5% or
one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin between 1.25% and 3.00% per annum. The Partnership is also required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the Credit Facility at a rate between 0.375% and 0.8% per annum, which is included
within interest expense on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. On March 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 3.9%. 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit the Partnership s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens,
make loans or investments, make cash distributions if a default exists or would result from the distribution, merger or consolidation with other persons, or engage in certain asset dispositions including the sale of all or substantially all of its
assets. The Partnership was in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2016. The Credit Agreement also requires the Partnership to maintain:      

Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated over a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, to be no less than the sum of (i) $80.0 million plus (ii) 80% of the aggregate
Consolidated EBITDA for each permitted acquisition completed after June 30, 2014;        

the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated Debt Service (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated over a period of four fiscal quarters, or the Consolidated Debt Service
Coverage Ratio, of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for any period; and        

the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated over a period of four fiscal quarters, or the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for any period.      On March 31, 2016, the Partnership s Consolidated
Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Debt Service Coverage Ratio were 3.30 and 4.53, respectively.      Senior Notes    
 On May 28, 2013, the Partnership issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  Senior
Notes ). The Partnership pays 7.875% interest per annum on the principal amount of the Senior Notes, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used to
retire a $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25% Senior Notes due 2017 and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The Senior Notes were issued at 97.832% of par resulting in gross proceeds of $171.2 million with
an original issue discount of approximately $3.8 million. The Partnership incurred debt issuance costs and fees of approximately $4.6 million. These costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized over the life of the Senior Notes. The Senior
Notes mature on June 1, 2021.    At any time prior to June 1, 2016, the Partnership may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price of 107.875%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing date of such equity offering. At any time on or after June 1, 2016, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at
the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount) set forth below, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning June 1 of the years indicated:

19  

Table of Contents  

  In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2016, the Partnership may also redeem all or any
portion of the Senior Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in the Indenture), including accrued and unpaid interest. Subject to certain exceptions,
upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of the Senior Notes will have the right to require the Partnership to purchase that holder s Senior Notes for a cash price equal to 101% of the principal
amounts to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.    The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our
subsidiaries. The Indenture governing the Senior Notes contains covenants, including limitations of the Partnership s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, make certain dividends, distributions, redemptions or
investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain asset sales, and engage in certain mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of the Partnership s assets. As of March 31, 2016, the Partnership
was in compliance with these covenants.      
   The Partnership is not subject to U.S. federal and most state income
taxes. The partners of the Partnership are liable for income tax in regard to their distributive share of the Partnership s taxable income. Such taxable income may vary substantially from net income reported in the accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements. Certain corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal and state income tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and tax carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Partnership records a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets if it deems that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realizable in future periods.  
 As of March 31, 2016, the Partnership had available approximately less than $0.1 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards,
which are available indefinitely, and $264.5 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2017 and $321.8 million in state net operating loss carryforwards, a portion of which expires annually.  
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether its more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As of March 31, 2016, based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future
taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Partnership will realize a partial benefit of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax assets
considered realizable could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.    In
accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Partnership recognizes only the impact of income tax positions that, based upon their merits, are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by a taxing authority. To evaluate its current tax
positions in order to identify any material uncertain tax positions, the Partnership developed a policy of identifying and evaluating uncertain tax positions that considers support for each tax position, industry standards, tax return disclosures
and schedules and the significance of each position. It is the Partnership s policy to recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Partnership had no material uncertain tax positions.    The Partnership is not currently under examination by any federal or state
jurisdictions. The federal statute of limitations and certain state statutes of limitations are open from 2012 forward.      
   The Partnership defers revenues and all direct costs associated with
the sale of pre-need cemetery merchandise and services until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed. The Partnership recognizes deferred merchandise and service revenues as deferred revenues within long-term liabilities on its
consolidated balance sheet. The Partnership recognizes deferred direct costs associated with pre-need merchandise and service revenues as deferred

selling and obtaining costs within long-term assets on its consolidated balance sheet. The Partnership also defers the costs to obtain new pre-need cemetery and new prearranged funeral
business as well as the investment earnings on the prearranged services and merchandise trusts.    At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
deferred revenues consisted of the following (in thousands):

  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS         2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan    
 During the year ended December 31, 2014, the General Partner s Board of Directors (the  Board ) and the Partnership s
unitholders approved a 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2014 LTIP ). The compensation committee of the Board (the  Compensation Committee ) administers the 2014 LTIP. The 2014 LTIP permits the grant of awards, which may
be in the form of phantom units, restricted units, unit appreciation rights ( UAR ), or unit options, including performance factors for each, covering an aggregate of 1,500,000 common units, a number that the Board may increase by up to
100,000 common units per year. At March 31, 2016, the estimated number of common units to be issued upon vesting and exercise of outstanding rights under this plan was 105,167, including management s estimated amounts for awards with
performance factors. A cumulative number of 14,455 common units have been issued, leaving 1,380,378 common units available for future grants under the plan, assuming no increases by the Board.  
  Phantom Unit Awards     Phantom units
represent rights to receive a common unit or an amount of cash, or a combination of either, based upon the value of a common unit. Phantom units become payable, in cash or common units, at the Partnership s election, upon the separation of
directors and executives from service or upon the occurrence of certain other events specified in the underlying agreements. Phantom units are subject to terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee, which may include vesting
restrictions. In tandem with phantom unit grants, the compensation committee may grant distribution equivalent rights ( DERs ), which are the right to receive an amount in cash or common units equal to the cash distributions made by
the Partnership with respect to common unit during the period that the underlying phantom unit is outstanding. All phantom units outstanding under the 2014 LTIP at March 31, 2016 contain tandem DERs.

2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan      The
Compensation Committee administers the Partnership s 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2004 LTIP ). The 2004 LTIP permitted the grant of awards, which may be in the form of phantom units, restricted units, or unit appreciation
rights ( UAR ). At March 31, 2016, the estimated number of common units to be issued upon vesting and exercise of outstanding rights under this plan was 189,155, based upon the closing price of our common units at March 31,
2016. A cumulative number of 626,188 common units have been issued under the 2004 LTIP. There were no awards available for grant under the 2004 LTIP at March 31, 2016 because the plan expired in 2014.  
  Phantom Unit Awards     Phantom units were
credited to participants  mandatory deferred compensation accounts in connection with DERs accruing on phantom units received under the 2004 LTIP. These DERs continue to accrue until the underlying securities are issued. The following
table sets forth the 2004 LTIP activity related to DERs credited as phantom units to the participant s accounts for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively:  

Total compensation expense for phantom units credited under both the 2004 and 2014 plans was approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     Unit Appreciation Rights Awards   
 UAR awards represent a right to receive an amount equal to the closing price of the Partnership s common units on the date preceding the
exercise date less the exercise price of the UARs, to the extent the closing price of the  
      22  

Table of Contents  

Partnership s common units on the date preceding the exercise date is in excess of the exercise price. This amount is then divided by the closing pricing of the Partnership s
common units on the date preceding the exercise date to determine the number of common units to be issued to the participant. UAR awards granted through March 31, 2016 have a five-year contractual term beginning on the grant date and vest
ratably over a period of 48 months beginning on the grant date. Of the UAR awards outstanding at March 31, 2016, 18,563 awards will vest within the following twelve months. The following table sets forth the UAR award activity for the
three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively:      

(1) 
 Based on the closing price of the common units on March 31, 2016 the estimated intrinsic value of the outstanding UARs was less than $0.1 million. The weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding UAR
awards at March 31, 2016 was 2.3 years.      At March 31, 2016, the Partnership had approximately $0.1 million of
unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested UAR awards that will be recognized through the year ended December 31, 2018. The Partnership recognized total compensation expense for UAR awards of less than $0.1 million for both the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. The Partnership issued 1,148 common units due to exercised UAR awards for the three months ended March 31, 2015. There were no UAR exercises during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES         Legal    
 The Partnership is party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business but does not expect the outcome of any proceedings,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.      Other    
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership moved its corporate headquarters to Trevose, Pennsylvania. Due to the relocation, a
cease-use expense of $0.5 million was recorded during the period below  Operating income  on the unaudited consolidated statement of operations. This charge represents the net recognition of the discounted liability for future rent
payments due under the lease on the previous headquarters, net of estimated sublease collections and deferred rent and lease incentives pertaining to the previous corporate office location.  
 In connection with the Partnership s 2014 lease and management agreements with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, it has committed to pay
aggregate fixed rent of $36.0 million in the following amounts:      
   The fixed rent for lease years 6 through 11 shall be deferred. If the Archdiocese terminates the agreements
pursuant to a lease year 11 termination or the Partnership terminates the agreements as a result of a default by the Archdiocese, prior to the end of lease year 11, the deferred fixed rent shall be retained by the Partnership. If the agreements are
not terminated, the deferred fixed rent shall become due and payable 30 days after the end of lease year 11.

  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS       Management has established a hierarchy to measure
the Partnership s financial instruments at fair value, which requires it to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from
independent sources; whereas, unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership s own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The hierarchy defines three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value:    Level 1   Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical,
unrestricted assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.    Level 2   Inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the same contractual term of the asset or liability.  
 Level 3   Unobservable inputs that the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in the pricing of
the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques.    The
Partnership s current assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets are considered to be financial instruments, and their estimated fair values approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature and thus are
categorized as Level 1. The Partnership s merchandise and perpetual care trusts consist of investments in debt and equity marketable securities and cash equivalents, are carried at fair value, and are considered either Level 1 or Level 2
(see Note 7 and 8).    The Partnership s other financial instruments as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of its Senior
Notes and outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility (see Note 10). The estimated fair values of the Partnership s Senior Notes as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $177.2 million and $179.9 million, respectively,
based on trades made on those dates, compared with the carrying amounts of $172.3 million and $172.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying values of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership s
revolving credit facility (see Note 10), which bears interest at variable interest rates with maturities of 90 days or less, approximated their estimated fair values. The Senior Notes are valued using Level 2 inputs.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (REVISED)     
 As discussed in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-Q/A and Note 2,  Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, 
in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this Form 10-Q/A, the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and
2015 have been revised to give effect to the Restatement. Accordingly, the discussion and analysis below for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 has been revised to give effect to the Restatement. The revised discussion and analysis
presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, and should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1.  
 Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q/A, including, but not limited to, information regarding our operating activities, the plans and
objectives of our management, and assumptions regarding our future performance and plans are forward-looking statements. When used in this Form 10-Q/A, the words  believes,   anticipates,   expects  and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management s expectations and estimates. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees and are made subject to certain risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this Form 10-Q/A.    Our
major risks are related to uncertainties associated with the cash flow from pre-need and at-need sales, trusts and financings, which may impact StoneMor s ability to meet its financial projections, service its debt, pay distributions, and
increase its distributions, as well as with its ability to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.   
 Our additional risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: uncertainties associated with future revenue and
revenue growth; uncertainties associated with the integration or anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions or any future acquisitions; our ability to complete and fund additional acquisitions; the effect of economic downturns; the impact of our
significant leverage on our operating plans; the decline in the fair value of certain equity and debt securities held in trusts; our ability to attract, train and retain an adequate number of sales people; uncertainties associated with the volume
and timing of pre-need sales of cemetery services and products; increased use of cremation; changes in the death rate; changes in the political or regulatory environments, including potential changes in tax accounting and trusting policies; our
ability to successfully implement a strategic plan relating to achieving operating improvements, strong cash flows and further deleveraging; our ability to successfully compete in the cemetery and funeral home industry; litigation or legal
proceedings that could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation; the effects of cyber security attacks due to our significant reliance on information technology; uncertainties relating to the financial condition of third-party
insurance companies that fund our pre-need funeral contracts; and various other uncertainties associated with the death care industry and our operations in particular.  
 Our risks and uncertainties are more particularly described in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the
year ended December 31, 2015. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements included in this Form 10-Q/A, which speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by applicable laws, we undertake no
obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    BUSINESS OVERVIEW
    We are a publicly-traded Delaware master-limited partnership ( MLP ) and provider of funeral and cemetery products and
services in the death care industry in the United States. As of March 31, 2016, we operated 307 cemeteries in 27 states and Puerto Rico, of which 276 are owned and 31 are operated under lease, management or operating agreements. We also owned and
operated 104 funeral homes in 19 states and Puerto Rico.     FINANCIAL PRESENTATION   
 Our consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the consolidated statements of operations for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 include our accounts and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations. Actual balances and results could be different from those estimates. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation
of the financial statements.

   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   
 On April 20, 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering of 2,000,000 common units at a public offering price of $23.65 per unit. Net
proceeds of the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $44.7 million. Additionally, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 300,000 common units, resulting in net proceeds
of $6.8 million, after deducting discounts and offering expenses. The proceeds from the issuances were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility.  
 On April 26, 2016, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.66 per common unit pertaining to the results for the first
quarter of 2016. The distribution is scheduled to be paid May 13, 2016 to common unit holders of record as of the close of business on May 6, 2016. 
 Subsequent to March 31, 2016, we issued 176,208 common units under an equity distribution agreement ( ATM Equity Program ) for net
proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.     REVENUE RECOGNITION   
   Cemetery Operations      Our cemetery
revenues are principally derived from sales of interment rights, merchandise and services. These sales occur both at the time of death, which we refer to as at-need, and prior to the time of death, which we refer to as pre-need. Pre-need
sales are typically sold on an installment plan. At-need cemetery sales and pre-need merchandise and services sales are recognized as revenue when the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed. For pre-need sales of interment rights, we
recognize the associated revenue when we have collected 10% of the sales price from the customer. We consider our cemetery merchandise delivered to our customer when it is either installed or ready to be installed and delivered to a third-party
storage facility until it is needed, with ownership transferred to the customer at that time. Pre-need sales that have not yet been recognized as revenue are recognized as deferred revenues, a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Direct
costs associated with pre-need sales that are recognized as deferred revenues, such as sales commissions, are recognized as deferred selling and obtaining costs, an asset on our consolidated balance sheet, until the merchandise is delivered or the
services are performed.      Funeral Home Operations    
 Our funeral home revenues are principally derived from at-need and pre-need sales of merchandise and services. Pre-need sales are
typically sold on an installment plan. Both at-need and pre-need funeral home sales are recognized as revenue when the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed. Pre-need sales that have not yet been recognized as revenue are recognized
as deferred revenues, a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Direct costs associated with pre-need sales that are recognized as deferred revenues, such as sales commissions, are recognized as deferred selling and obtaining costs, an asset on
our consolidated balance sheet, until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed. Our funeral home operations also include revenues related to the sale of term and final expense whole life insurance. As an agent for these insurance
sales, we earn and recognize commission-related revenue streams from the sales of these policies.      Trust Investment Income    
 Sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services are subject to state law. Under these laws, which vary by state, a portion of
the cash proceeds received from the sale of interment rights and pre-need sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services are required to be deposited into trusts. For sales of interment rights, a portion of the cash proceeds received
are required to be deposited into a perpetual care trust. While the principal balance of the perpetual care trust must remain in the trust in perpetuity, we recognize investment income on such assets as revenue, excluding realized gains and losses
from the sale of trust assets. For sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services, a portion of the cash proceeds received are required to be deposited into a merchandise trust until the merchandise is delivered or the services are
performed, at which time the funds deposited, along with the associated investment income, may be withdrawn. Investment income from assets held in the merchandise trust is recognized as revenues when withdrawn. Amounts deposited into trusts are
invested by third-party investment managers who are selected by the Trust Committee of the board of directors of our general partner. These investment managers are required to invest our trust funds in accordance with applicable state law and
internal investment guidelines adopted by the Trust Committee. Our investment managers are monitored by investment advisors selected by the Trust Committee who advise the committee on the determination of asset allocations, evaluate the investment
managers and provide detailed monthly reports on the performance of each merchandise and perpetual care trust.

   GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK   
 We expect our business to be affected by key trends in the deathcare industry, based upon assumptions made by us and information currently
available. Deathcare industry factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include, but are not limited to, demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age, which impacts death rates and number of deaths,
increasing cremation trends, and increasing memorialization trends. In addition, we are subject to fluctuations in the fair value of equity and fixed-maturity debt securities held in our trusts. These values can be negatively impacted by
contractions in the credit market and overall downturns in economic activity. Our ability to make payments on our debt and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders depends on our success at managing these industry trends. To
the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Cemetery Operations
      Overview     We are currently
the second largest owner and operator of cemeteries in the United States. As of March 31, 2016, we operated 307 cemeteries in 27 states and Puerto Rico. We own 276 of these cemeteries and we manage or operate the remaining 31 under lease, operating
or management agreements. Revenues from cemetery operations accounted for approximately 78.8% of our total revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  
  Operating Results     The following table
presents operating results for our cemetery operations for the respective reporting periods (in thousands):      
   Cemetery merchandise revenues were $32.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of
$3.4 million from $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase is principally due to an increase in recognized sales of markers and mausoleums. Cemetery services revenues were $13.5 million for the three months ended March
31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million from $14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in opening and closing service revenues. Investment and other income was $12.1 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $3.0 million from $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in trust income due to higher invested capital amounts and increased
income withdrawals from our merchandise trusts and a $1.6 million increase in large land sales. Interest income remained consistent at $2.2 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.

  Cost of goods sold was $10.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of
$0.9 million from $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in perpetual care costs, due to an increase in burial right values, and changes in the value and mix of products.  
 Cemetery expenses were $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.4 million from $16.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2015. This decrease was principally due to a $0.7 million decrease in personnel costs, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in repairs and maintenance expenses.  
 Selling expenses were $14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $0.7 million from $13.9 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase in personnel costs.    General and
administrative expenses were $9.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, relatively consistent with $9.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
   Funeral Home Operations       Overview   
 As of three months ended March 31, 2016, we owned and operated 104 funeral homes. These properties are located in 19 states and Puerto Rico.
Revenues from funeral home operations accounted for approximately 21.2% of our total revenues during three months ended March 31, 2016.    Operating
Results     The following table presents operating results for our funeral home operations for the respective reporting periods (in
thousands):      
   Funeral home merchandise revenues were $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of
$0.4 million from $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Funeral home service revenues were $8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a $0.7 million increase from $8.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
2015. Both increases were principally due to increases in casket and service revenues, respectively, compared to the prior period.  
 Funeral home expenses were $13.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.5 million from $12.2 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase principally consists of a $0.9 million increase in personnel costs, a $0.3 million increase in costs associated with insurance-related sales, and a $0.2 million increase in facility costs.

    Corporate Overhead    
 Corporate overhead was $10.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.2 million from $9.1 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was principally due to an increase in acquisition-related costs. These costs may vary from period to period depending on the amount of acquisition activity that takes place.  
   Depreciation and Amortization    
 Depreciation and amortization expense was consistent with the prior period, with $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016,
an increase of $0.1 million from $3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015.     Other Gains and Losses    
 For the three months ended March 31, 2016, other gains and losses included a cease-use expense of $0.5 million that was recorded due to the
relocation of corporate headquarters to Trevose, Pennsylvania. We also sold a funeral home building and related real property for a net loss of $0.4 million.  
   Interest Expense      Interest expense
was $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $0.3 million from $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was principally due to an increase in interest expense on amounts outstanding under
the credit facility, which had higher average amounts outstanding during the current period than the comparable period.     Income Tax Expense
     Income tax expense was $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an decrease of $0.2 million from a expense of
$0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our effective tax rate differs from our statutory tax rate primarily because our legal entity structure includes different tax filing entities, including a significant number of
partnerships that are not subject to paying tax.      Supplemental Data

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
   General      Our primary sources of
liquidity are cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capital raised through the issuance of additional limited partner units. Our primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are
for debt service, capital expenditures and cash distributions. In general, we expect to fund:      

cash distributions and maintenance capital expenditures through available cash and cash flows from operating activities;        

expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits through cash generated from operations and additional borrowings; and        

debt service obligations through additional borrowings or by the issuance of additional limited partner units or asset sales.    
 We rely on cash flow from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of additional limited partner units to execute our
growth strategy and meet our financial commitments and other short-term financial needs. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us to the extent required and on acceptable terms.  
 We believe that we will have sufficient liquid assets, cash from operations and borrowing capacity to meet our financial commitments, debt
service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve-month period. However, we are subject to business, operational and other risks that could adversely affect our cash flow. We may
supplement our cash generation with proceeds from financing activities, including borrowings under our credit facility and other borrowings, the issuance of additional limited partner units, and the sale of assets and other transactions.  
   Cash Flows - Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2015    
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $5.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.7 million from
$5.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The $0.7 million unfavorable movement in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from a $2.8 million unfavorable movement in working capital and a $2.1 million favorable
movement in net income excluding non-cash items. The unfavorable movement in working capital was principally due to timing differences, greater net-contributions to our merchandise trusts and the satisfaction of performance
obligations. The favorable movement in net income excluding non-cash items was due principally to our cemetery operations.    Net cash
used in investing activities was $4.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.6 million from $2.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities during the three
months ended March 31, 2016 consisted of $4.5 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $0.1 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015 principally
consisted of $2.8 million for capital expenditures.    Net cash flows used in financing activities were $2.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 compared with $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Cash flows used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted primarily of cash distributions to unit holders of $21.4
million, partially offset by $18.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units and $0.1 million of net borrowings. Cash flows used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015 consisted primarily of cash
distributions to unit holders of $17.9 million, partially offset by $10.9 million of net borrowings.    Capital Expenditures   
 Our capital requirements consist primarily of:      

Expansion capital expenditures   we consider expansion capital expenditures to be capital expenditures that expand the capacity of our existing operations; and    

Maintenance capital expenditures   we consider maintenance capital expenditures to be any capital expenditures that are not expansion capital expenditures   generally, this will include expenditures to
maintain our facilities.

     Issuance of Common Units    
 During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we issued 727,474 common units under the ATM program for net proceeds of $18.8 million.  
   Long-Term Debt       Credit Facility   
 We are a party to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the  Credit Agreement ), which provides for a single
revolving credit facility of $180.0 million (the  Credit Facility ) maturing on December 19, 2019. Additionally, the Credit Agreement provides for an uncommitted ability to increase the Credit Facility by an additional $70.0
million. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding those held in trust. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either acquisition draws or working capital
draws. Acquisition draws may be utilized to finance permitted acquisitions, the purchase and construction of mausoleums and related costs or the net amount of merchandise trust deposits. Working capital draws may be utilized to finance working
capital requirements, capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. The amount of the Credit Facility that is available for working capital draws is subject to a borrowing formula equal to 85% of eligible accounts receivable, as
defined within the Credit Agreement. At March 31, 2016, the amount available under the Credit Facility for working capital advances under this limit was $140.1 million, of which $106.5 million was outstanding at March 31, 2016.  
 Each individual acquisition draw is subject to equal quarterly amortization of the principal amount, with annual principal payments comprised
of ten percent of the related advance amount, commencing on the second anniversary of such advance, with the remaining principal due on December 19, 2019, subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements. Up to $10.0 million of the Credit
Facility may be in the form of standby letters of credit, of which there were none outstanding at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin between 2.25%
and 4.00% per annum or the base rate (which is the higher of the bank s prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 0.5% or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin between 1.25% and 3.00% per annum. We are also required to pay a fee
on the unused portion of the Credit Facility at a rate between 0.375% and 0.8% per annum, which is included within interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. At March 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 3.9%.   The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit our ability to
incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make cash distributions if a default exists or would result from the distribution, merger or consolidation with other persons, or engage in certain asset dispositions including
the sale of all or substantially all of its assets. We were in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2016. The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain:      

Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated over a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, to be no less than the sum of (i) $80.0 million plus (ii) 80% of the aggregate
Consolidated EBITDA for each permitted acquisition completed after June 30, 2014;    
      35  

Table of Contents  

the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated Debt Service (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated over a period of four fiscal quarters, or the Consolidated Debt Service
Coverage Ratio, of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for any period; and        

the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated over a period of four fiscal quarters, or the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for any period.       Senior Notes   
 On May 28, 2013, we issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  Senior Notes ). We pay
7.875% interest per annum on the principal amount of the Senior Notes, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the offering were used to retire a $150.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 10.25% Senior Notes due 2017 and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The Senior Notes were issued at 97.832% of par resulting in gross proceeds of $171.2 million with an original issue discount of
approximately $3.8 million. We incurred debt issuance costs and fees of approximately $4.6 million. These costs and fees are deferred and will be amortized over the life of these notes. The Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2021.  
 At any time prior to June 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash
proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price of 107.875%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes remain outstanding
and (ii) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing date of such equity offering. At any time on or after June 1, 2016, we may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages
of the principal amount) set forth below, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning June 1 of the years indicated:  
   
   In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2016, we may also redeem all or any portion of the Senior Notes
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in the Indenture), including accrued and unpaid interest. Subject to certain exceptions, upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of the Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase that holder s Senior Notes for a cash price equal to 101% of the principal amounts to be purchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest.    The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries. The Indenture
governing the Senior Notes contains covenants, including limitations of our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness and liens, make certain dividends, distributions, redemptions or investments, enter into certain transactions with
affiliates, make certain asset sales, and engage in certain mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets, among other items. As of March 31, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants.  
   Cash Distribution Policy      Our
partnership agreement requires that we distribute 100% of available cash to our common unitholders and general partner within 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests. Available
cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts, less cash disbursements. Our general partner is granted discretion under the partnership agreement to establish, maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses, debt service,
maintenance capital expenditures and distributions for the next four quarters. These reserves are not restricted by magnitude, but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated.  
      36  

Table of Contents  

  Available cash is distributed to the common limited partners and the general partner in
accordance with their ownership interests, subject to the general partner s incentive distribution rights if quarterly cash distributions per limited partner unit exceed specified targets. Incentive distribution rights are generally
defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of its general partner ownership interest. The incentive distribution rights will entitle our general partner to receive the following increasing percentage of
cash distributed by us as it reaches certain target distribution levels:      

13.0% of all cash distributed in any quarter after each common unit has received $0.5125 for that quarter;        

23.0% of all cash distributed in any quarter after each common unit has received $0.5875 for that quarter; and        

48.0% of all cash distributed in any quarter after each common unit has received $0.7125 for that quarter.    
   Agreements with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia    
 In accordance with the lease and management agreements with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, we have agreed pay to the Archdiocese aggregate
fixed rent of $36.0 million in the following amounts:      
   The fixed rent for lease years 6 through 11 shall be deferred. If the Archdiocese terminates the agreements
pursuant to a lease year 11 termination or we terminate the agreements as a result of a default by the Archdiocese, prior to the end of lease year 11, the deferred fixed rent shall be retained by us. If the agreements are not terminated, the
deferred fixed rent shall become due and payable 30 days after the end of lease year 11.     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires making
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are
prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense
accruals, fair value of merchandise and perpetual care trusts assets and the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired. A discussion of our significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements was included in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K/A  for the year ended December 31, 2015, and we summarize our significant accounting policies within our
consolidated financial statements included in Note 1 under  Item 1  of this Form 10-Q/A.      

ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (As Revised)       We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.    In connection with our Original Filing, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our Disclosure Committee and management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based on
that evaluation, as of March 31, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in our
reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules  
      37  

Table of Contents  

and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.     In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2,
 Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements , under Item 1. Financial Statements unaudited), under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we re-evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. In conducting our re-evaluation, we considered the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. Based on this reevaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2016.    As
discussed in the Explanatory Note and Note 2,  Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial statements,  included in this Form 10-Q/A, we determined to restate our previously issued financial statements to correct for errors
associated with the recognition and presentation of certain revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities, both recognized and deferred, the allocation of income and loss to our partners, and errors in the processing of transactions. As a result of
this restatement, management identified deficiencies in our processes and procedures that constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as follows:  

A. 
 The Partnership did not design and maintain effective controls over establishing accounting policies nor did they periodically review them for appropriate application in the financial statements.    

B. 
 The Partnership did not design and maintain effective controls over the review of certain recorded balances within  Deferred cemetery revenues, net,   Merchandise liability,   Investment and
other  revenues,  Cemetery property,  and  Partners  Capital .        

C. 
 The Partnership did not design and maintain effective controls over the reconciliation of amounts recorded in the general ledger to relevant supporting details.    
 In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, management re-evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. Based on that re-assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015, due to the material weaknesses described above.  
 Management is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses, as well as the continued improvement of our internal control
over financial reporting ( ICFR ). We are in the process of implementing measures to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses, which primarily include:  

1. 
 Reevaluating and establishing, on a periodic basis, accounting policies and the appropriate application thereof;        

2. 
 Enhancing control procedures related to the review of certain recorded balances affected by the material weaknesses to ensure the appropriateness of such balances; and    

3. 
 Enhancing the control procedures related to the reconciliation of amounts recorded in the general ledger to relevant supporting details.    
 We believe these measures will remediate the material weaknesses noted. While we have completed some of these measures as of the
date of this report, we have not completed and tested all of the planned corrective processes, enhancements, procedures and related evaluation that we believe are necessary to determine whether the material weaknesses have been
fully remediated. We believe the corrective actions and controls need to be in operation for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude that the control environment is operating effectively and has been adequately tested through
audit procedures. Therefore, the material weaknesses have not been fully remediated as of the date of this report. As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material
weaknesses, we may determine that additional measures or time are required to address the control deficiencies or that we need to modify or otherwise adjust the remediation measures described above. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of
our remediation efforts in connection with our evaluation of our ICFR.     CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   
 Except as set forth above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
