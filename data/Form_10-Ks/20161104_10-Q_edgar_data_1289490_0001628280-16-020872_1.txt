1. 
    ORGANIZATION 
       
  Extra Space Storage Inc. (the  Company ) is a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ), formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties ( stores ) located throughout the United States. The Company continues the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. The Company s interests in its stores is held through its operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the  Operating Partnership ), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company s primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders. 
    
  The Company invests in stores by acquiring wholly-owned stores or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in   999   stores. In addition, the Company managed   422   stores for third parties, bringing the total number of stores which it owns and/or manages to   1,421  . These stores are located in   38   states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. 
    
  The Company operates in   three   distinct segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. The rental operations activities include rental operations of stores in which we have an ownership interest. No single tenant accounts for more than   5.0%   of rental income. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the Company s stores. The Company s property management, acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing and selling stores.

    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
       
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information, and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they may not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the Company s audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers,    which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. The new standard will now become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.    This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2015-02 amends the criteria for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a

variable interest entity ( VIE ), and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,    Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)   Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,    which provides guidance regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the payment of fees should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses. If there is no software license, the fees should be accounted for as a service contract. The guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or (2) retrospectively. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842),    which requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements, and other than the inclusion of operating leases on the Company's balance sheet, such effects have not yet been determined. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."    ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on several specific cash flow issues, including the classification of debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments, and distributions received from equity method investees.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements. 

3. 
    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
       
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves. 
    
  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. In conjunction with the FASB s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. 
    
  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of  
  
   11

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (unaudited) (continued)

current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The table below presents the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

The Company did not have any significant assets or liabilities that are re-measured on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The Company reviews each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. The Company focuses on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, the Company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent, and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, the Company carefully reviews stores in the lease-up stage and compares actual operating results to original projections. 
    
  When the Company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, the Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets. 
    
  When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, the Company would recognize a loss on the assets held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   one   parcel of undeveloped land classified as held for sale. The estimated fair value less selling costs of each of these assets is greater than the carrying value of the assets, and therefore no loss has been recorded. 
    
  The Company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. 
    
  In connection with the Company s acquisition of stores, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on the Company s historical experience with turnover in its stores. Debt assumed as part of

an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable-rate notes payable, lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   approximate fair value. 
    
  The fair values of the Company s notes receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders and other fixed rate notes receivable were based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the notes (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rate used approximated the current market rate for loans with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair values of the Company s fixed-rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts were estimated using the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rates used approximated current market rates for loans, or groups of loans, with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair value of the Company s exchangeable senior notes was estimated using an average market price for similar securities obtained from a third party. 
    
  The fair values of the Company s fixed-rate assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated: 

4. 
    EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
       
  Basic earnings per common share is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted stock awards contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders; accordingly, they are considered participating securities that are included in the two-class method. Diluted earnings per common share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding during the period. The denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued, and is calculated using either the two-class, treasury stock or as if-converted method, whichever is most dilutive. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, convertible debt, Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units ( Series A Units ), Series B Redeemable Preferred Units ( Series B Units ), Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units ( Series C Units ), Series D Redeemable Preferred Units ( Series D Units ) and common Operating Partnership units ( OP Units )) that do not have a current right to participate in earnings of the Company but could do so in the future by virtue of their option, redemption or conversion right. 
    
  In computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the period associated with the convertible security. The numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In computing diluted earnings per common share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per common share) are included. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , options to purchase approximately   95,031   and   82,571   shares of common stock, respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , options to purchase approximately   84,919   and   50,144   shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the computation of earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

For the purposes of computing the diluted impact of the potential exchange of the Preferred Operating Partnership units for common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the intent and ability to settle the redemption in shares, the Company divided the total value of the Preferred Operating Partnership units by the average share price for the period presented.  The average share price for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $84.41   and   $73.24  , respectively.  The average share price for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $87.22   and   $68.94  , respectively.  The following table presents the number of Preferred Operating Partnership units, and the potential common shares, that were excluded from the computation of earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 

The Operating Partnership had   $63,172   of its   2.375%   Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 (the  2013 Notes ) issued and outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The 2013 Notes could potentially have a dilutive impact on the Company s earnings per share calculations. The 2013 Notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company s common stock under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture governing the 2013 Notes. The exchange price of the 2013 Notes was   $54.37   per share as of   September 30, 2016  , and could change over time as described in the indenture. The Company has irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the 2013 Notes relative to its exchange obligations, but retained the right to satisfy the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common stock. 
    
  The Operating Partnership had   $575,000   of its   3.125%   Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035 (the  2015 Notes ) issued and outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The 2015 Notes could potentially have a dilutive impact on the Company s earnings per share calculations. The 2015 Notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company s common stock under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture governing the 2015 Notes. The exchange price of the 2015 Notes was   $94.96   per share as of   September 30, 2016  , and could change over time as described in the indenture. The Company has irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the 2015 Notes relative to its exchange obligations, but retained the right to satisfy the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common stock. 
    
  Although the Company has retained the right to satisfy the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes in cash and/or common stock, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 260,    Earnings per Share,    requires an assumption that shares would be used to pay such exchange obligation, and requires that those shares be included in the Company s calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share computation. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   413,498   and   383,279   shares, respectively, related to the 2013 Notes were included in the computation for diluted earnings per share. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   shares related to the 2015 Notes were included in the computation for diluted earnings per share as the exchange price exceeded the per share price of the Company s common stock during these periods. 
    
  For the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential exchange of Series A Units for common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the positive intent and ability to settle at least   $115,000   of the instrument in cash (or net settle a portion of the Series A Units against the related outstanding note receivable), only the amount of the instrument in excess of   $115,000   is considered in the calculation of shares contingently issuable for the purposes of computing diluted earnings per share as allowed by ASC 260-10-45-46.  Accordingly, the number of shares included in the computation for diluted earnings per share related to the Series A Units is equal to the number of Series A Units outstanding, with no additional shares included related to the fixed   $115,000   amount.

    On September 16, 2016, the Company acquired   23   stores from its ESS PRISA II LLC joint venture ("PRISA II") in a step acquisition.  These stores are located in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia.  The Company owned   4.42%   of PRISA II, with the other   95.58%   owned by affiliates of Prudential Global Investment Management ("Prudential").  PRISA II created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 131 LLC ("ESP 131"), and transferred   23   stores into ESP 131.  PRISA II then distributed ESP 131 to the Company and Prudential on a pro rata basis.  This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of   $4,326  .  Immediately after the distribution, the Company acquired Prudential's   95.58%   interest in ESP 131 for   $238,679  , resulting in   100%   ownership of ESP 131 and the related   23   stores.  Based on the purchase price of Prudential's share of ESP 131, the Company determined that the fair value of its investment in ESP 131 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential's share was   $10,988  , and the Company recorded a gain of   $6,662   as a result of re-measuring to fair value its existing equity interest in ESP 131.  This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.  The Company recorded fixed assets related to this acquisition of   $248,530  , which includes total cash paid, the investment in ESP 131, and the step acquisition gain, less net assets acquired.  Subsequent to these transactions, PRISA II owned   42   stores.  The Company sold its   4.42%   interest in PRISA II to Prudential immediately following these transactions as disclosed in Note 6. 
              (2) 
    On February 2, 2016, the Company acquired   six   stores from its VRS Self Storage LLC joint venture ( VRS ) in a step acquisition. These stores are located in Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York, and Tennessee.  The Company owns   45.04%   of VRS, with the other   54.96%   owned by affiliates of Prudential. VRS created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 122 LLC ( ESP 122 ) and transferred   six   stores into ESP 122. VRS then distributed ESP 122 to the Company and Prudential on a pro rata basis. This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of   $17,261  . Immediately after the distribution, the Company acquired Prudential s   54.96%   interest in ESP 122 for   $53,940  , resulting in   100%   ownership of ESP 122 and the related   six   stores. Based on the purchase price of Prudential s share of ESP 122, the Company determined that the fair value of its investment in ESP 122 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential s share was   $44,184  , and the Company recorded a gain of   $26,923   as a result of re-measuring to fair value its existing equity interest in ESP 122. This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners  interests on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.  The Company recorded fixed assets related to this acquisition of   $98,082  , which includes total cash paid, the investment in ESP 122, and the step acquisition gain, less net assets acquired.  
       
  Store Dispositions 
    
  On July 26, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of   one   operating store located in Indiana that had been classified as held for sale for   $4,447   in cash.  The Company recognized   no   gain or loss related to this disposition. 
    
  On April 20, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of   seven   operating stores located in Ohio and Indiana that had been classified as held for sale for $  17,555   in cash.  The Company recognized a gain of $  11,265   related to this disposition. 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Company disposed of a single store in Texas in exchange for   85,452   of our OP Units valued at $  7,689  . The Operating Partnership canceled the OP Units received in this disposition.  The Company recognized a gain of $  93   related to this disposition. 
    
  Losses on Earnout from Prior Acquisition 
  In December 2014, the Company acquired a portfolio of   five   stores located in New Jersey and Virginia. As part of this acquisition, the Company agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016. At the acquisition date, the Company recorded an estimated liability related to this earnout provision. The operating income of these stores during the earnout period has been higher than expected, resulting in an increase in the estimate of the amount due to the sellers of   $1,544  , which was recorded as a loss and included in loss earnout from prior acquisitions in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

    VARIABLE INTERESTS 
       
  The Operating Partnership has   three   wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiaries ( Trust,   Trust II  and  Trust III,  together, the  Trusts ) that have issued trust preferred securities to third parties and common securities to the Operating Partnership. The proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities were loaned in the form of notes to the Operating Partnership. The Trusts are VIEs because the holders of the equity investment at risk (the trust preferred securities) do not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly affect the entities  economic performance because of their lack of voting or similar rights. Because the Operating Partnership s investment in the Trusts  common securities was financed directly by the Trusts as a result of its loan of the proceeds to the Operating Partnership, that investment is not considered an equity investment at risk. The Operating Partnership s investment in the Trusts is not a variable interest because equity interests are

variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk, and therefore the Operating Partnership cannot be the primary beneficiary of the Trusts. Since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Trusts, they have not been consolidated. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of notes for the proceeds as discussed above, which are owed to the Trusts. The Company has also included its investment in the Trusts  common securities in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The Company has not provided financing or other support during the periods presented to the Trusts that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the Trusts is equal to the total amount of the notes discussed above less the amounts of the Company s investments in the Trusts  common securities. The net amount is equal to the notes payable that the Trusts owe to third parties for their investments in the Trusts  preferred securities. 
    
  Following is a tabular comparison of the assets and liabilities the Company has recorded as a result of its involvement with the Trusts to the maximum exposure to loss the Company is subject to as a result of such involvement as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The Company had   no   consolidated VIEs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

8. 
    DERIVATIVES 
       
  The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposure that arises from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s investments and borrowings. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. A portion of these changes is excluded from accumulated other comprehensive income as it is allocated to noncontrolling interests. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. During the remainder of 2016, the Company estimates that an additional   $4,553   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 
    
  The Company held   31   derivative financial instruments which had a total combined notional amount of   $2,119,860   as of   September 30, 2016  .

Effect of Derivative Instruments 
  The tables below present the effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented. No tax effect has been presented as the derivative instruments are held by the Company: 

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
  The Company has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions pursuant to which the Company could be declared in default of its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender. 
    
  The Company also has an agreement with some of its derivative counterparties that incorporates the loan covenant provisions of the Company s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with the loan covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was   $39,749  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of   September 30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $42,533  , including accrued interest.

    EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES 
       
  In September 2015, the Operating Partnership issued   $575,000   of its   3.125%   Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035. Costs incurred to issue the 2015 Notes were approximately   $11,992  , consisting primarily of a   2%   underwriting fee. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over   five years  , which represents the estimated term based on the first available redemption date, and are included in exchangeable senior notes, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The 2015 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning April 1, 2016, until the maturity date of October 1, 2035. The Notes bear interest at   3.125%   per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2015 Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2015 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s option. The exchange rate of the 2015 Notes as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   10.53   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 2015 Notes. 
    
  The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes at any time to preserve the Company s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after October 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at   100%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least   30 days   but not more than   60 days   prior written notice to the holders of the 2015 Notes. The holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on October 1 of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030 (unless the Operating Partnership has called the 2015 Notes for redemption), and upon the occurrence of certain designated events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered  Events of Default,  as defined in the indenture governing the 2015 Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2015 Notes. 
    
  On June 21, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued   $250,000   of its   2.375%   Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 at a   1.5%   discount, or   $3,750  . Costs incurred to issue the 2013 Notes were approximately   $1,672  . These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over   five years  , which represents the estimated term based on the first available redemption date, and are included in exchangeable senior notes, net, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The 2013 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning January 1, 2014, until the maturity date of July 1, 2033. The 2013 Notes bear interest at   2.375%   per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2013 Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2013 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s option. The exchange rate of the 2013 Notes as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   18.39   shares of the Company s common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 2013 Notes. 
    
  The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2013 Notes at any time to preserve the Company s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after July 5, 2018, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2013 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at   100%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least   30 days   but not more than   60 days   prior written notice to the holders of the 2013 Notes. The holders of the 2013 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2013 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on July 1 of the years 2018, 2023 and 2028, and upon the occurrence of certain designated events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered  Events of Default,  as defined in the indenture governing the 2013 Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2013 Notes. 
    
  Additionally, the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes can be exchanged during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock of the Company is greater than or equal to   130%   of the exchange price for at least   20   trading days during a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The price of the Company s common stock exceeded   130%   of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2013 Notes during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Therefore, holders of the 2013 Notes may elect to exchange such notes during the quarter ending   December 31,   2016.  The price of the Company s common stock did not exceed   130%   of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2015 Notes during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  GAAP requires entities with convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost. The Company therefore accounts for the liability and equity components of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes

separately. The equity components are included in paid-in capital in stockholders  equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the value of the equity components are treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt components. The discounts are being amortized as interest expense over the remaining period of the debt through its first redemption date: July 1, 2018 for the 2013 Notes, and October 1, 2020 for the 2015 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability components of both the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes is   4.0%  , which approximates the market rate of interest of similar debt without exchange features (i.e. nonconvertible debt) at the time of issuance. 
    
  Information about the Company s 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes, including the total carrying amounts of the equity components, the principal amounts of the liability components, the unamortized discounts and the net carrying amounts was as follows for the periods indicated: 

The amount of interest cost recognized relating to the contractual interest rates and the amortization of the discounts on the liability components of the Notes were as follows for the periods indicated: 

Repurchases of 2013 Notes 
  During April 2016, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of $  2,553   of the 2013 Notes.  The Company paid cash for the principal amount and issued a total of   18,031   shares of common stock valued at $  1,686   for the exchange value in excess of the principal amount. During February 2016, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of   $19,639   of the 2013 Notes. The Company paid cash for the principal amount, and issued a total of   130,909   shares of common stock valued at   $11,380   for the exchange value in excess of the principal amount.  
  The Company allocated the value of the consideration paid to repurchase the 2013 Notes (1) to the extinguishment of the liability component and (2) to the reacquisition of the equity component. The amount allocated to the extinguishment of the liability component is equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to extinguishment. The difference between the consideration attributed to the extinguishment of the liability component and the sum of (a) the net carrying amount of the repurchased liability component, and (b) the related unamortized debt issuance costs, is recognized as a gain on debt extinguishment. The remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component of the repurchased 2013 Notes and recognized as a reduction of stockholders  equity.

    NONCONTROLLING INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS 
       
  Classification of Noncontrolling Interests 
  GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section, but separate from the company s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the Operating Partnership s preferred units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by such preferred units as stockholders  equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling interest as permanent equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount and (2) the redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made. 
    
  Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units 
  On June 15, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement with various limited partnerships affiliated with AAAAA Rent-A-Space to acquire   ten   stores in exchange for   989,980   Series A Units of the Operating Partnership. The stores are located in California and Hawaii. 
    
  The partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership (as amended, the  Partnership Agreement ) provides for the designation and issuance of the Series A Units. The Series A Units will have priority over all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation. 
    
  Under the Partnership Agreement, Series A Units in the amount of   $115,000   bear a fixed priority return of   5%   and have a fixed liquidation value of   $115,000  . The remaining balance participates in distributions with, and has a liquidation value equal to, that of the OP Units. The Series A Units are redeemable at the option of the holder, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at the Company s option, in cash or shares of its common stock. 
    
  On June 25, 2007, the Operating Partnership loaned the holders of the Series A Units   $100,000  . The note receivable bears interest at   4.85%  . During 2013, a loan amendment was signed extending the maturity date to September 1, 2020. The loan is secured by the borrower s Series A Units. The holders of the Series A Units could redeem up to   114,500   Series A Units prior to the maturity date of the loan. If any redemption in excess of   114,500   Series A Units occurs prior to the maturity date, the holder of the Series A Units is required to repay the loan as of the date of that redemption. On October 3, 2014, the holders of the Series A Units redeemed   114,500   Series A Units for   $4,794   in cash and   280,331   shares of common stock.   No   additional redemption of Series A Units can be made without repayment of the loan. The Series A Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the   $100,000   loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Series A Units. 
    
  Series B Redeemable Preferred Units 
  On April 3, 2014, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of a store located in Georgia. This store was acquired in exchange for   $15,158   of cash and   333,360   Series B Units valued at   $8,334  . 
    
  On August 29, 2013, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of   19   out of   20   stores affiliated with All Aboard Mini Storage, all of which are located in California. On September 26, 2013, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of the remaining store. These stores were acquired in exchange for   $100,876   of cash (including   $98,960   of debt assumed and immediately defeased at closing),   1,342,727   Series B Units valued at   $33,568  , and   1,448,108   OP Units valued at   $62,341  . 
  The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series B Units. The Series B Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series C Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation. 
    
  The outstanding Series B Units have a liquidation value of   $25.00   per unit for a fixed liquidation value of   $41,902  . Holders of the Series B Units receive distributions at an annual rate of   6.0%  . These distributions are cumulative. The Series B Units became redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company s option in cash or shares of its common stock. 
    
  Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units 
  On November 19, 2013, the Company entered into Contribution Agreements with various entities affiliated with Grupe Properties Co. Inc. ( Grupe ), under which the Company agreed to acquire   twelve   stores, all of which are located in California. The Company completed the purchase of these stores between December 2013 and May 2014. The Company previously held   35%   interests in   five   of these stores and a   40%   interest in   one   store through   six   separate joint ventures with Grupe. These stores were acquired in exchange for a total of approximately   $45,722   of cash, the assumption of   $37,532   in existing debt, and the issuance of   704,016   Series C Units valued at   $30,960  .

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series C Units. The Series C Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation. 
    
  The outstanding Series C Units have a liquidation value of   $42.10   per unit for a fixed liquidation value of   $29,639  . From issuance to the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distribution per OP Unit plus   $0.18  . Beginning on the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive a fixed quarterly distribution equal to the aggregate quarterly distribution payable in respect of such Series C Unit during the four quarters immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of issuance, divided by four. These distributions are cumulative. The Series C Units became redeemable at the option of the holder   one year   from the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company s option in cash or shares of its common stock. The Series C Units also became convertible into OP Units at the option of the holder   one year   from the date of issuance, at a rate of   0.9145   OP Units per Series C Unit converted. This conversion option expires upon the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. 
    
  In December 2014, the Operating Partnership loaned certain holders of the Series C Units   $20,230  . The notes receivable, which are collateralized by the Series C Units, bear interest at   5.0%   per annum and mature on   December 15, 2024  . The Series C Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the   $20,230   loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Series C Units. 
    
  Series D Redeemable Preferred Units 
  On May 21, 2016, the Operating Partnership completed the acquisition of   four   stores located in Illinois.  These stores were acquired in exchange for   2,201,467   Series D-3 Preferred Units ("D-3 Units") valued at $  55,037  . 
  In December 2014, the Operating Partnership completed the acquisition of a store located in Florida. This store was acquired in exchange for   $5,621   in cash and   548,390   Series D-1 Preferred Units ("D-1 Units," and together with the D-3 Units, "Series D Units") valued at   $13,710  . 
    
  The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series D Units. The Series D Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series C Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation. 
    
  The Series D Units have a liquidation value of   $25.00   per unit, for a fixed liquidation value of   $68,747  . Holders of the Series D Units receive distributions at an annual rate between   4.0%   to   5.0%  .  These distributions are cumulative. The Series D Units become redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company s option in cash or shares of its common stock.  In addition the D-3 Units are exchangeable for common OP Units until the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance.  The D-1 Units are not exchangeable for common OP Units. 

12. 
    NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP 
       
  The Company s interest in its stores is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust II, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a limited partner of the Operating Partnership. Between its general partner and limited partner interests, the Company held a   91.6%   ownership interest in the Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016  . The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership (including Preferred Operating Partnership units) of   8.4%   are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership. 
    
  The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP Units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the formation of the Company, and as a result of subsequent acquisitions, certain persons and entities contributing interests in stores to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership interests in the form of OP Units. Limited partners who received OP Units in the formation transactions or in exchange for contributions for interests in stores have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP Units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company s common stock (based on the   ten  -day average trading price) at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to acquire those OP Units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a   one-for-one basis  , subject to anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Partnership Agreement. The ten-day average closing stock price at   September 30, 2016   was   $79.62   and there were   5,537,223   OP Units outstanding.

Assuming that all of the OP Unit holders exercised their right to redeem all of their OP Units on   September 30, 2016   and the Company elected to pay the OP Unit holders cash, the Company would have paid   $440,874   in cash consideration to redeem the units. 
    
  GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section, but separate from the company s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations, and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity. 
    
  The Company has evaluated the terms of the OP Units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the OP Units as stockholders  equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount and (2) the redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made. 

13. 
    OTHER NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
       
  Other noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interest of third parties in   one   consolidated joint venture as of   September 30, 2016  . This joint venture owns an operating store in Texas. The voting interests of the third-party owner are   20.0%  .  
    
  On August 1, 2016, the Company purchased its joint venture partner's remaining   3.33%   interest in an existing joint venture in exchange for   8,889   OP Units, valued at   $800  .  This joint venture owned   one   store located in California, and as a result of this purchase, this store became wholly-owned by the Company.  Prior to this acquisition, the partner's interest was reported in other noncontrolling interests.  Since the Company retained its controlling interest in the joint venture, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction.  The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to   zero   to reflect the purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the Company. 
    
  On June 11, 2015, the Company purchased its joint venture partner s remaining   1%   interest in an existing joint venture for   $1,267  . The joint venture owned   19   properties in California, Florida, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, and as a result of this purchase, these properties became wholly-owned by the Company. Prior to this acquisition, the partner s interest was reported in other noncontrolling interests. Since the Company retained its controlling interest in the subsidiary, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to   zero   to reflect the purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the Company.

    EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE VENTURES GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE AND PURCHASE OF JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS  INTERESTS 
       
  On September 16, 2016, the Company acquired   23   operating stores from PRISA II in a step acquisition.  The Company recognized a non-cash gain of   $6,662   related to this transaction as a result of revaluing its existing equity interest upon the purchase of the remaining interest.  See Note 5 for more information on this transaction. 
    
  On September 16, 2016, subsequent to its acquisition of   23   properties as outlined in Note 5, the Company sold its   4.42%   interest in PRISA II to Prudential for   $34,758   in cash.  The carrying value of the Company's investment prior to the acquisition was   $3,912  , and the Company recorded a gain on the sale of   $30,846  .  This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.   
    
  On February 2, 2016, the Company acquired   six   operating stores from VRS in a step acquisition. The Company recognized a non-cash gain of   $26,923   related to this transaction as a result of revaluing its existing equity interest upon the purchase of the remaining interest.

In March 2015, ESS PRISA II LLC ( PRISA II ), a joint venture in which the Company held a   2.0%   interest, sold   one   store located in New York for   $90,000  . As a result of the sale, PRISA II recognized a gain of   $60,496   and the Company recorded its   2.0%   portion of the gain, or   $1,228  . 
    
  In March 2015, the Company acquired its joint venture partner s   82.4%   interest in Sacramento One, an existing joint venture which owned one store located in California, for   $1,700  . In addition, the Company held mortgage notes receivable from Sacramento One totaling   $11,009  , which were written off as part of the total consideration. Prior to the acquisition, the remaining   17.6%   interest was owned by the Company, which accounted for its investment in Sacramento One using the equity method. The Company recorded a non-cash gain of   $1,629   related to this transaction, which represents the increase in fair value of the Company s interest in the joint venture from its formation to the acquisition date. 

15.    SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  The Company operates in   three   distinct segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. Management fees collected for wholly-owned stores are eliminated in consolidation. Financial information for the Company s business segments is presented below: 

16. 
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and is subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. Therefore, any estimate(s) of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent the Company s maximum loss exposure. The Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that the Company is currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against it. 
    
  The Company currently has a legal proceeding pending against it that includes causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure, violations of various state specific self-storage statutes, and violations of various consumer fraud acts. As a result of this litigation matter, the Company has recorded a liability of   $4,800   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was under contract to acquire   9   operating stores and   13   stores to be acquired upon the completion of construction.  The Company also had an agreement to acquire   11   operating stores from an existing joint venture.  The total purchase price of of all stores with commitments was   $392,635  . Of these stores,   22   are scheduled to close in 2016. The remaining stores will close upon completion of construction, expected to occur on various dates in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the Company is under contract to acquire   8   stores with joint venture partners, for a total purchase price of   $55,780  .    One   of these stores is scheduled to close in 2016 while the remaining   seven   stores are expected to close in 2017 and 2018. 
    
  Although there can be no assurance, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liability, for which it believes it will be ultimately responsible, that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to its properties could result in future material environmental liabilities.

  CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE 
    
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited    Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    and the    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)    appearing elsewhere in this report and the    Consolidated Financial Statements,   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    and    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-Q entitled    Statement on Forward-Looking Information  .  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   describe the significant accounting policies essential to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Preparation of our financial statements requires estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the period presented. If there are material differences between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual facts, our financial statements may be affected. 
    
  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result. See the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures.

  We derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores; from management fees on the stores we manage for joint venture partners and unaffiliated third parties; and from our tenant  
  
   28 

reinsurance program. Our management fee is equal to approximately 6% of cash collected from the managed stores. We also receive an asset management fee of 0.5% of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures. 
    
  We operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. Our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units and actively manage rental rates, and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by centrally adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems. 
    
  We continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following: 

Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management.   We pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system s ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost. 
                
    Acquire self storage stores.   Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals. 
                
    Expand our management business  . Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and to expand our geographic footprint. We believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores. 

PROPERTIES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned, had ownership interests in, or managed   1,421   stores in   38   states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. Of these   1,421   stores, we owned   810   stores, we held joint venture interests in   189   stores, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., operated an additional   422   stores that are owned by third parties. These operating stores contain approximately   107 million   square feet of rentable space in approximately   955,000   units. 
    
  Our stores are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These markets contain above-average population growth and income demographics. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions and management business have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence. 
    
  We consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% average occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   855,000   tenants were leasing storage units at the   1,421   operating stores that we own and/or manage, primarily on a month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually, for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time. For stores that were stabilized as of   September 30, 2016  , the average length of stay was approximately   14.2   months for tenants that vacated during the preceding twelve month period. 

29 

The average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores, net of discounts and bad debt, was   $16.00     for the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.11     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  . Average annual rent per square foot for new leases was   $16.67     for the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.67     for the three months ended September 30, 2015  . The average discounts, as a percentage of rental revenues, during these periods were   2.9%   and   2.7%  , respectively. 
    
  Our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located. Most often sites are what we consider  hybrid  stores, a mix of drive-up and multi-floor buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator access only, and a number of stores featuring ground-floor access only. 
    
  The following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized stores by state as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The information as of   September 30, 2015   is on a pro forma basis as though all the stores owned and/or managed at   September 30, 2016   were under our control as of   September 30, 2015  .

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Comparison of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Overview 
  Results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   included the operations of   999   stores (  810   wholly-owned,   one   in a consolidated joint venture, and   188   in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which included the operations of   868   stores (  616   wholly-owned,   one   in a consolidated joint venture, and   251   in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). 
  
   34 

Revenues 
  The following table presents information on revenues earned for the periods indicated:  

Property Rental   The increase in property rental revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of increases of   $43,670   and   $119,516   associated with acquisitions completed in   2016   and   2015  .  We acquired   72   stores during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 171 stores during the year ended December   2015  .  Property rental revenue also increased by   $9,540   and   $34,083   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores.  Revenues at our lease-up stores increased by   $1,476   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $2,806   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in the prior year. Occupancy at our wholly-owned stabilized stores increased to   92.4%   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   92.0%   at   September 30, 2015  . The achieved rental rate to new tenants on wholly owned properties for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased an average of approximately   6.6%   over the same period in the prior year.  These increases were offset by decreases in property revenue of   $783   and   $1,141   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to the sales of stores during 2016. 
    
  Tenant Reinsurance   The increase in our tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of stores operated. We operated   1,421   stores at   September 30, 2016   compared to   1,170   stores at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Management Fees and Other Income   Our taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ), Extra Space Management, Inc., manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. Management fees represent approximately 6% of cash collected from these stores. We also earn an asset management fee from one of our joint ventures, equal to 0.5% of the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. The increase in management fee revenues was due to an increase in revenues at the managed stores as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates, and to an increase in the number of properties managed. We managed   611   stores for joint ventures and third parties as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   554   stores as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Expenses 
  The following table presents information on expenses for the periods indicated: 

35 

Property Operations   Property operations expense increased by   $13,087   and   $39,318   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as a result of stores added from acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015. We acquired   72   operating stores during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and 171 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Additionally, expenses at our stabilized stores increased by   $632   and   $2,292   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Expenses were higher for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   due to increases in property taxes, repairs and maintenance and office expense. Increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in payroll and auction expenses. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , expenses were higher due to increases in property taxes, office expense and insurance expense. Increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in utility expenses, auction expenses and repairs and maintenance expense. 
    
  Tenant Reinsurance   Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed.   September 30, 2016  , we owned and/or managed   1,421   stores compared to   1,170   stores at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Acquisition Related Costs and Other   These costs relate primarily to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. The increase in these expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period was due to an increase in the number of acquisitions.  We acquired 27 properties during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to one acquisition during the same period in the prior year.  The increase in these expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year was due to an increase in the number of acquisitions completed during these periods. We completed the acquisition of   72   stores during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 40 stores during the same period in the prior year.  Also included as other is $800 related to the write down of a note receivable during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  General and Administrative   General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the overall cost associated with the management of additional stores. At   September 30, 2016  , we owned and/or managed   1,421   stores compared to   1,170   stores at   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we accrued a $4,000 expense related the potential settlement of a legal action. We did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization   Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired   72   operating stores during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 171 operating stores during the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
  
   36 

Other Revenues and Expenses 
  The following table presents information about other revenues and expenses for the periods indicated: 

Gain on Sale of Real Estate and Earnout from Prior Acquisition   On July 26, 2016, we closed on the sale of   one   operating store located in Indiana that had been classified as held for sale for   $4,447   in cash.  We recognized   no   gain or loss related to this disposition. 
    
  On April 20, 2016, we closed on the sale of   seven   operating stores located in Ohio and Indiana that had been classified as held for sale for $  17,555   in cash.  We recognized a gain of $  11,265   related to this disposition. 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we disposed of a single store in Texas in exchange for   85,452   of our OP Units valued at $  7,689  .  The Operating Partnership has canceled the OP Units received in this disposition.  We recognized a gain of $  93   related to this disposition. 
    
  During 2014, we acquired a portfolio of five stores. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016. At the acquisition date, we recorded an estimated liability related to this provision. The operating income of these stores during the earnout period has been higher than expected, resulting in an increase in the payment due to the sellers of $1,544, which was recorded as a loss during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In 2011, we acquired a single store in Florida. As part of the acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for the period of 12 consecutive months ending June 30, 2015. During 2014, we recorded a liability of $2,500 as an estimate of the payment that would become due. The $400 gain recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of June 30, 2015. 
  
   37 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and we therefore recorded a $1,101 gain, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid. 
    
  Interest Expense   The increase in interest expense during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of higher debt balances during these periods when compared to the same periods in the prior year. The total face value of our debt, including our lines of credit, was   $4,047,217   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3,492,710   at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable Senior Notes   Represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership. The 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes both have an effective interest rate of 4.0% relative to the carrying amount of the liability. The increase for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in the prior year is due to the issuance of $575,000 principal amount of the 2015 Notes in September 2015 and related discount of $22,597. 
    
  Interest Income   Interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. The increases for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   related primarily to the increase in notes receivable when compared to the same periods in the prior year. We had   $67,098   of notes receivable included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $8,692   as of   September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to the issuance of a $84,331 note receivable on October 1, 2015 related to the acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage LLC and related transactions.  In June, 2016, we received a partial payment on the note receivable of   $30,738  . 
    
  Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership Unit Holders   Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holders of the Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units of our Operating Partnership ( Series A Units ). 
    
  Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. The increases for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in the prior year were primarily the result of an increase in our ownership interest from 2% to approximately 4% as well as an increases in revenue at the stores owned by the joint ventures.  This increase was offset by the lower income in our VRS joint venture (defined below) due to the joint venture having six fewer stores subsequent to our acquisition of these stores on February 2, 2016. 
    
  On April 25, 2016, we and Prudential entered into the  Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of ESS PRISA LLC  and the  First Amendment to Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of ESS PRISA II LLC  (the  Amendments ).  The Amendments are deemed effective as of April 1, 2016.  Under the Amendments, we gave up any future rights to receive distributions from these joint ventures at the higher  excess profit participation  percentage of   17.0%   in exchange for a higher equity ownership percentage.  Our equity ownership in ESS PRISA LLC increased from   2.0%   to   4.0%  , and our equity ownership in ESS PRISA II LLC increased from   2.0%   to   4.42%  .  
    
  Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture Partners  Interests   On September 16, 2016, we acquired   23   stores from our ESS PRISA II LLC joint venture ("PRISA II") in a step acquisition.  We owned   4.42%   of PRISA II, with the other   95.58%   owned by affiliates of Prudential.  PRISA II created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 131 LLC ("ESP 131"), and transferred   23   stores into ESP 131.  PRISA II then distributed ESP 131 to Prudential and us on a pro rata basis.  This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of   $4,326  .  Immediately after the distribution, we acquired Prudential's   95.58%   interest in ESP 131 for   $238,679  , resulting in   100%   ownership of ESP 131 and the related   23   stores.  Based on the purchase price of Prudential's share of ESP 131, we determined that the fair value of its investment in ESP 131 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential's share was   $10,988  , and we recorded a gain of   $6,662   as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ESP 131.  Subsequent to these transactions, PRISA II owned   42   stores.  We then sold our remaining interest in PRISA II to Prudential for   $34,758   in cash.  As a result of this sale, we recognized a gain of   $30,846  . 

38 

On February 2, 2016, we acquired six stores from our VRS Self Storage LLC joint venture ( VRS ) in a step acquisition. We owned 45.04% of VRS, with the other 54.96% owned by affiliates of Prudential Global Investment Management ( Prudential ). VRS created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 122 LLC ( ESP 122 ) and transferred six stores into ESP 122. VRS then distributed ESP 122 to Prudential and us on a pro rata basis. This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $17,261, Immediately after the distribution, we acquired Prudential s 54.96% interest in ESP 122 for $53,940, resulting in 100% ownership of ESP 122 and the related six stores. Based on the purchase price of Prudential s share of ESP 122, we determined that the fair value of our investment in ESP 122 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential s share was $44,184, and we recorded a gain of $26,923 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ESP 122. 
    
  During March 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in New York to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. We recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228. 
    
  In March 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner s 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture which had one property. We previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. We recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition. 
    
  Income Tax Expense   For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the increases in income tax expense is the result of an increase in income earned by our  TRS  when compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
    
  Net Income Allocated to Noncontrolling Interests 
  The following table presents information on net income allocated to noncontrolling interests for the periods indicated: 

Net Income Allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership Noncontrolling Interests   Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   represents the fixed distributions paid to holders of the Series A Units, Series B Units, Series C Units and Series D Units, plus approximately   0.64%   of the remaining net income allocated to holders of the Series A Units. 
    
  Net Income Allocated to Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Interests   Income allocated to the Operating Partnership represents approximately   4.0%   and   4.5%   of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS 
    
  Funds from Operations ( FFO ) provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe FFO more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National  
  
   39 

Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT ) as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. 
    
  The following table presents the calculation of FFO for the periods indicated: 

SAME-STORE RESULTS 
    
  Our same-store pool for the periods presented consists of   564   stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year.  We believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to: occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments.  Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole.  The following table presents operating data for our same-store portfolio.  
  
   40 

Same-store revenues   for the three months ended September 30, 2016   increased due to higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. Expenses were higher   for the three months ended September 30, 2016   due to increases in property taxes, repairs and maintenance and office expenses.  Increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in payroll and auction expenses.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , expenses were higher due to increases in property taxes, office expense and insurance expense. Increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in utility expenses, auction expenses and repairs and maintenance expense. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of same-store net operating income to income from operations as presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:

CASH FLOWS 
    
  Cash flows provided by operating activities were   $386,159   and   $286,281  , respectively for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of   $108,881  , and an increase in depreciation and amortization of   $40,711  . These increases were offset by a non-cash gain on the purchase of joint venture partners  interests of   $61,575  . This non-cash gain was primarily the result of two step acquisitions of stores that were previously owned by our VRS and PRISA II joint ventures. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was $  704,310   and $  486,434  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for the acquisition of real estate assets of   $499,842  . We purchased   72   stores during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to only 40 stores purchased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was offset by a decrease in the change in restricted cash of   $217,680   when compared to the prior year.  The large change in restricted cash in 2015 was related to the acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage, Inc., which closed on October 1, 2015.  There was also an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate assets and investments in real estate ventures of   $55,986   and an increase in cash received from principal payments on notes receivable of $  41,393   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in 2015.  
    
  Cash provided by financing activities was $  261,044   and $  1,268,022  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The change related primarily to a decrease in proceeds from notes payable and lines of credit of $  691,778  , a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes of   $563,500  , and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $  323,486   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in principal payments on notes receivable and lines of credit of   $450,523   and an increase in the cash paid for the repurchase of exchangeable senior notes of $  205,020  .  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $18,692   available in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to use this cash for acquisitions, to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. 
    
  The following table presents information on our lines of credit for the period presented. All of our lines of credit are guaranteed by us and secured by mortgages on certain real estate assets. 

(2)   
    One two-year extension available 
               (3)   
    Two one-year extensions available 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $4,047,217   face value of debt, resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of   27.5%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was   76.1%   (including   $2,208,188   on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). The weighted average interest rate of the total of  
  
   42 

fixed- and variable-rate debt at   September 30, 2016   was   3.1%  . Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of Operating Partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our lines of credit. In addition, we are pursuing additional term loans secured by unencumbered stores. 
    
  Our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, store acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and non-recurring capital expenditures. We may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We do not expect that our operating cash flow or cash balances will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Any additional issuance of equity or equity-linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock. We may also use Operating Partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  Except as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities, nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 

FINANCING STRATEGY 
    
  We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. Although our board of directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed- or variable-rate. In making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to: 

the interest rate of the proposed financing; 
                
    the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores; 
                
    prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing; 
                
    the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing; 
                
    long-term objectives with respect to the financing; 
                
    target investment returns; 
                
    the ability of particular stores, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments; 
                
    overall level of consolidated indebtedness; 
                
    timing of debt and lease maturities; 
                
    provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization; 
                
    corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and 
                
    the overall ratio of fixed- and variable-rate debt. 
     
   43 

Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores, or we may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing stores, for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable. 
    
  Typically, we invest in or form consolidated special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real estate industry, are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness. 
    
  We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt, as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 

SEASONALITY 
    
  The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated 
    
  Market Risk 
  Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $4,047,217   in total face value of debt, of which   $883,012   was subject to variable interest rates without floors or caps (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable-rate debt (excluding variable-rate debt with interest rate floors) would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by   $8,830   annually. 
    
  Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure. 

44 

The fair values of our fixed-rate assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated: 

The fair value of our note receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders and other notes receivable was based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the note (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rate used approximated the current market rate for loans with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair values of our fixed-rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts were estimated using the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rates used approximated current market rates for loans, or groups of loans, with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair value of our exchangeable senior notes was estimated using an average market price for similar securities obtained from a third party. 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
           (1) 
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
       
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  We have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining our disclosure obligations a timely basis. The disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
    
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
           (2) 
    Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
       
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

45 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  We are involved in various legal proceedings and are subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. Therefore, any estimate(s) of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us. 
    
  We currently have a legal proceeding pending against us that includes causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure, violations of various state specific self-storage statutes, and violations of various consumer fraud acts. As a result of this litigation matter, we have recorded a liability of $4,800, which is included in other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 
       
  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
       
  On August 1, 2016, our Operating Partnership issued 8,889 common OP Units in connection with the acquisition of our joint venture partner's interest in a store located in California.  The interest was acquired in exchange for the OP Units, valued at $800. 
    
  The terms of the common OP Units are governed by the Operating Partnership's Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership.  The common OP Units will be redeemable at the option of the holders on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock.  
    
  The common OP Units were issued to accredited investors in private placements in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
