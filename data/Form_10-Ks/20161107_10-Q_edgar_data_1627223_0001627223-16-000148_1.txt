  NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

Note 1. Background and Description of the Business 
  The Chemours Company ( Chemours  or the  Company ) delivers customized solutions with a wide range of industrial and specialty chemical products for markets including plastics and coatings, refrigeration and air conditioning, general industrial, mining and oil refining.  Principal products include titanium dioxide ( TiO   2    ), refrigerants, industrial fluoropolymer resins and sodium cyanide.  Chemours consists of   three   reportable segments: Titanium Technologies, Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions. 
  Chemours is globally operated with manufacturing facilities, sales centers, administrative offices and warehouses located throughout the world.  Chemours' operations are primarily located in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the Netherlands, Belgium, China, Taiwan, Japan, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, India and France.  During 2016, Chemours sold its Clean   Disinfect product line (the  C D business ), Sulfur Products business (the  Sulfur business ) and its aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, which collectively consisted of 10 production facilities from the Chemical Solutions segment. As of   September 30, 2016  , Chemours consists of   25   production facilities globally,   five   dedicated to Titanium Technologies,   16   dedicated to Fluoroproducts,   three   dedicated to Chemical Solutions and   one   that supports multiple Chemours segments.  
  Effective prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) on July 1, 2015 (the  Distribution Date ), E. I.  du Pont de Nemours and Company ( DuPont ) completed the previously announced separation of the businesses comprising DuPont s Performance Chemicals reporting segment, and certain other assets and liabilities, into Chemours, a separate and distinct public company.  The separation was completed by way of a distribution of all of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Chemours through a dividend in kind of Chemours  common stock (par value   $0.01  ) to holders of DuPont common stock (par value   $0.30  ) as of the close of business on June 23, 2015 (the  Record Date ).  
  On the Distribution Date, each holder of DuPont's common stock received one share of Chemours  common stock for every five shares of DuPont's common stock held on the Record Date.  The separation was completed pursuant to a Separation Agreement and other agreements with DuPont related to the separation, including an Employee Matters Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and an Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement.  These agreements govern the relationship between Chemours and DuPont following the separation and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations.  These agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by DuPont to Chemours.  
  Unless the context otherwise requires, references in these Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements to  we,   us,   our,   Chemours  and the  Company  refer to The Chemours Company and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the separation.   
   
  Note 2. Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods have been included.  Results for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results for a full year and the year-end consolidated balance sheet does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Chemours did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity for the full period covered by the 2015 interim consolidated financial statements.  Prior to the separation on July 1, 2015, Chemours operations were included in DuPont's financial results in different legal forms, including but not limited to wholly-owned subsidiaries for which Chemours was the sole business, components of legal entities in which Chemours operated in conjunction with other DuPont businesses and a majority owned joint venture.  For periods prior to July 1, 2015, the interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared from DuPont s historical accounting records and are presented on a stand-alone basis as if the business operations had been conducted independently from DuPont.  DuPont and its subsidiaries  net investments in these operations are shown in lieu of Stockholders  Equity in the interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The interim consolidated financial statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities that were considered to comprise the Chemours business, including certain environmental remediation and litigation obligations for which Chemours has indemnified DuPont.

  NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share) 

All of the allocations and estimates in the interim consolidated financial statements prior to July 1, 2015 were based on assumptions that management believed were reasonable.  However, the interim consolidated financial statements for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   included herein may not be indicative of the results of operations and cash flows of Chemours if it had been a separate, stand-alone entity during that period.  
  The net transfers from DuPont in the Interim Consolidated Statements of Stockholders  Equity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   include a non-cash contribution from DuPont of   $93  .  This non-cash contribution occurred during physical separation activities at shared production facilities in the United States prior to the separation. 
   
  Note 3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued various updates to the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which clarifies and amends certain cash receipts and cash payments presentation and classification in the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method (unless impractical to do so) to each period presented and earlier application is permitted.  Chemours is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect the adoption will have a significant impact on its cash flows. 
  In March through May 2016, the FASB issued various updates to the ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606).   The additional updates provide further clarifications on certain objectives and application of the core principle of Topic 606 for recognizing revenue.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  The guidance is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (original effective date), with one year deferral permitted from the original effective date. Chemours is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the guidance on its financial positions and results of operations and expects to adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2018. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718).   The update sets forth areas for simplification within several aspects of the accounting for shared-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.  Chemours is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance but does not expect the adoption will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which supersedes the leases requirements in Topic 840.  The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,   Elements of Financial Statements  , and, therefore, recognition of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases.  A qualitative disclosure along with specific quantitative disclosures is required to provide enough information to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities.  Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application of the amendments in this update is permitted for all entities.  Chemours is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial position, results of operations and debt covenants. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,  which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  The customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If the cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted.  Chemours adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016 prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date.  The adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   The amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities and eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership.  The amendment is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  Chemours adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not change our consolidated entities, and therefore had no effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
   
  Note 4. Relationship with DuPont and Related Entities 
  Prior to the separation, including the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , Chemours sold finished goods to DuPont and its non-Chemours businesses.  Related party sales to DuPont recorded by Titanium Technologies, Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were   $2  ,   $34   and   $21  , respectively.  Subsequent to the separation, beginning on July 1, 2015, transactions with DuPont businesses were not considered related party transactions. 
  Also prior to the separation, DuPont incurred significant corporate costs for services provided to Chemours as well as other DuPont businesses.  These costs included expenses for information systems, accounting, other financial services such as treasury and audit, purchasing, human resources, legal, facilities, engineering, corporate research and development, corporate stewardship, marketing and business analysis support.  A portion of these costs benefited multiple or all DuPont businesses, including Chemours, and were allocated to Chemours and its reportable segments using methods based on proportionate formulas involving total costs or other various allocation methods that management considered consistent and reasonable.  Other Chemours corporate costs are not allocated to the reportable segments and are reported in Corporate and Other.  
  The allocated leveraged functional service expenses and general corporate expenses included in the Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations were   $238   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were recorded within cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense for   $23  ,   $205   and   $10  , respectively.  Subsequent to the separation on July 1, 2015, transactions with DuPont businesses were not considered related party transactions.  Accordingly,   no   costs from DuPont were allocated to Chemours for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Management and Financing 
  The separation agreement sets forth a process to true-up cash and working capital transferred to us from DuPont at separation.  In January 2016, Chemours and DuPont entered into an agreement, contingent upon the credit agreement amendment (described in Note 15), which provided for the extinguishment of payment obligations of cash and working capital true-ups previously contemplated in the separation agreement.  As a result, Chemours is no longer required to make any payments to DuPont, nor will DuPont make any payments to Chemours.   
  In addition, the agreement set forth an advance payment by DuPont of approximately   $190  , which Chemours received in February 2016, for certain specified goods and services that Chemours expects to provide to DuPont over   twelve   to   fifteen   months under existing agreements between the parties.  The advance payment was recorded as deferred liability included in other accrued liabilities of the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets and approximately   $93   remains outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Tax Matters Agreement 
  The tax matters agreement that Chemours and DuPont entered into governs the parties  respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes.  In general, under the agreement, DuPont is responsible for any U.S. federal, state and local taxes (and any related interest, penalties or audit adjustments) reportable on a consolidated, combined or unitary return that includes DuPont or any of its subsidiaries and Chemours and/or any of its subsidiaries for any periods or portions thereof ending on or prior to the date of the separation and Chemours is responsible for any U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes (and any related interest, penalties or audit adjustments) that are imposed on Chemours and/or any of its subsidiaries for all tax periods, whether before or after the date of the separation.

Note 5. Restructuring and Asset Related Charges, Net 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Chemours recorded charges for restructuring and asset related charges as follows:   

1     
    The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include   $46   of impairment charges related to the aniline facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi (see Note 12 for further information).  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also includes   $58   impairment charges in connection with the sale of the Sulfur business (see Note 6 for further information).  Charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 represent asset impairment related to the reactive metals manufacturing facility (see Note 12 for further information). 
     The charges related to the restructuring programs impacted segment earnings for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   as follows: 

1   
    Includes charges related to employee separation, decommissioning and dismantling costs, and asset related charges in connection with the restructuring activities. 
               2   
    Includes approximately   $13   related to Corporate overhead functions that was allocated to the segments for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
       
  Plant and product line closures 
  Titanium Technologies Plant Closure:     As a result of the decommissioning and dismantling activities related to the closure of the Edge Moor manufacturing plant in the U.S., the Company recorded charges of approximately   $5   and   $24   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, in the Titanium Technologies segment.  The decommissioning, dismantling and removal activities will continue for the remainder of 2016 through early 2017 and the Company expects to incur additional charges of approximately   $8  , which is lower than previously forecasted and will be expensed as incurred.

  The Chemours Company 
  NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share) 

Fluoroproducts Restructuring:   The Company s Fluoroproducts segment recorded charges of approximately   $1   and   $6   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to decommissioning, dismantling and removal activities on certain of its production lines in the U.S.   The Company also expects to incur an additional   $4   for dismantling and removal costs in the remainder of 2016 through early 2017, which will be expensed as incurred. 
  The plant and product line closures for the Titanium Technologies and Fluoroproducts segments were implemented in the third quarter of 2015.  As a result, in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded restructuring charges of   $126   in the Titanium Technologies segment, which consist of   $114   related to the write-off of substantially all of the Edge Moor plant assets carrying value and   $12   of employee separation charges.  We also recorded restructuring charges of   $10   in the Fluoroproducts segment, which consist of   $8   property, plant and equipment accelerated depreciation and   $2   of employee separation charges. 
  RMS Closure:   In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company announced the closure of its Chemical Solutions segment s Reactive Metals (RMS) manufacturing facility located in Niagara Falls, New York.  The Company stopped production at its Niagara plant in September 2016 and immediately began decommissioning the plant.  As a result, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of approximately   $3   for contract termination and approximately   $4   for decommissioning and other asset write-offs.  An additional   $11   for decommissioning and site redevelopment are expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2016 through 2018.  Impairment charges of RMS related assets of approximately   $45   were recorded in the third quarter of 2015 (see Note 12 for further information). 
  2015 Global restructuring 
  Prior to the separation, in the second quarter of 2015, the Company implemented a restructuring plan, which resulted in a global workforce reduction of more than   430   positions and a pre-tax charge of   $3   and   $64   for employee separation costs in the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The actions associated with these charges and related payments were substantially completed at   September 30, 2016  . 
  After the separation, in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company announced an additional global workforce reduction of approximately   430   positions as part of its ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify its organizational structure and reduce costs.  The Company recorded approximately   $48   of employee separation costs during the fourth quarter of 2015.  The Company also incurred additional   $1   and   $5   of employee separation costs for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, in connection with this restructuring plan.  The actions associated with these charges are expected to be completed by the end of 2016 and related payments are expected to be completed in 2017.

Note 6. Sales of Assets and Businesses 
  On June 13, 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Veolia North America ( Veolia ), pursuant to which Veolia agreed to acquire the Sulfur business of Chemours  Chemical Solutions segment for a purchase price of   $325   in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, of which approximately   $10   was received in May 2016.  The Company completed the sale and received the remaining proceeds of approximately   $311   on July 29, 2016, net of estimated working capital adjustments.  Prior to the completion of the sale, in the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an impairment loss of approximately   $58   in  Restructuring and asset related charges, net  of the Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations.  When the sale was completed in the third quarter of 2016, the Company also recorded an additional pre-tax loss on sale of approximately   $3  , net of a benefit from contract adjustments, in  Other income, net  of the Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations. The net book value of the assets and liabilities disposed in the period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $342   and   $11  , respectively.  The sale is still subject to certain customary post-closing conditions.   
  On April 22, 2016, the Company entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement with LANXESS Corporation, ( Lanxess ), pursuant to which Lanxess agreed to acquire the C D business of Chemours  Chemical Solutions segment by acquiring certain Chemours  subsidiaries and assets for a purchase price of   $230   in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments.  The Company completed the sale and received proceeds of   $223   on August 31, 2016, net of working capital adjustments and approximately   $2   of cash transferred.  As a result, for the three and nine month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately   $172   in  Other income, net  in the Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The net book values of the assets and liabilities disposed were   $48   (including goodwill of   $13  ) and   $6  , respectively, and the Company incurred approximately   $9   of transaction and other related charges.  The sale is still subject to certain customary post-closing conditions.  
  In November 2015, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas to The Dow Chemical Company ( Dow ), and the net book value of the related asset group (including goodwill) was classified as assets held-for-sale at December 31, 2015 included in  Prepaid expenses and other  of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The transaction closed on March 1, 2016 and Chemours received   $140   in cash from Dow.  The net book value of the assets disposed was   $41   (including goodwill of   $4  ), and the Company incurred approximately   $11   of transaction and other related charges.  As a result of this transaction, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Chemours recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately   $88   in the Chemical Solutions segment.  
  The aggregate amount and major components of assets and liabilities disposed during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are as follows:

Note 7. Other Income (Expense), Net 

1   
    Miscellaneous income includes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.  
               2   
    Royalty income is primarily for technology and trademark licensing.   
               3   
    The three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes a gain on sale of C D business and loss on sale of Sulfur business.  The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   also includes a gain on sale of aniline facility.  See Note 6 for further details. 
               4   
    Exchange losses, net includes gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts.  See Note 17 for additional information. 
      
  Note 8. Income Taxes    
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Chemours recorded a provision for income tax of   $30   and a benefit from income tax of   $78  , respectively, or an effective income tax rate of approximately   13%   and   73%  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Chemours recorded a provision for income tax of   $25   and a benefit from income tax of   $63  , respectively, or an effective income tax rate of   9%   and   94%  , respectively. 
  The   $108   and   $88     increase   in provision for income tax for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and the corresponding changes in the effective income tax rates were primarily due to the Company s geographical mix of earnings.  The gain on the sale of assets and business (see Note 6) resulted in an increase in tax expense and a corresponding change in the effective income tax rate for the period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  These increases in tax provision were partially offset by restructuring charges, asset impairments and foreign currency exchange losses recognized in the period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Note 9. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock 
  The table below shows a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the periods indicated.   

1    
    Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated using net income (loss) available to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common shares outstanding during each period, which includes unvested restricted shares. Diluted earnings per share considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an antidilutive effect.

  Note 11. Inventories    

Inventory values, before LIFO adjustment, are generally determined by the average cost method, which approximates current cost.  Inventories are valued under the LIFO method at substantially all of the U.S. locations, which comprised   $577   and $  744   or   54%   and   61%   of inventories before the LIFO adjustments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The remainder of inventory held in international locations and certain U.S. locations is valued under the average cost method. 
   
  Note 12. Property, Plant and Equipment 
  Depreciation expense amounted to   $72   and   $210   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $69   and   $198   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.

We evaluate long-lived assets and finite-lived identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset groupings may not be recoverable. When undiscounted future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing market participant assumptions.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company evaluated the carrying value of its aniline manufacturing facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi for recoverability given current business plans.  The evaluation performed indicated that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable when compared to the expected undiscounted cash flows.  Based on management s assessment of the fair value of the asset group, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Pascagoula aniline asset group exceeded its fair value and as a result, a   $46   pre-tax impairment charge was recorded in the Chemical Solutions segment, which represents an impairment of substantially all of the remaining net book value of the Pascagoula aniline asset group. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with the strategic evaluation of the Chemical Solutions portfolio, excluding cyanides, the Company determined that the carrying value of its RMS manufacturing facility in Niagara, New York may not be recoverable given the strategic decision to discontinue investment in the business.  An impairment evaluation was performed which indicated that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable when compared to the expected undiscounted cash flows.  Based on management s assessment of the fair value of the asset group, the Company determined that the carrying value of the RMS asset group exceeded its fair value and as a result, a   $45   pre-tax impairment charge was recorded in the Chemical Solutions segment, which represents an impairment of substantially all of the remaining net book value of RMS asset group.  
  The fair value of the respective asset groups were determined using an income approach based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The key assumptions used included growth rates and cash flow projections, discount rate, tax rate and an estimated terminal value.  The use of these unobservable inputs resulted in the fair value estimate being classified as a Level 3 asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to its original recognition.  The impairment charges were recorded in  Restructuring and asset related charges, net  in the Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period incurred. 
   
  Note 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net 
  Goodwill:    The following table summarizes changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment as of   September 30, 2016  :  

1     Represents goodwill disposed in connection with the sale of the C D business (See Note 6). 
   2     Net currency translation adjustment was less than   $1   for the period presented. 
  In the third quarter of 2015, in connection with the strategic evaluation of Chemical Solutions and goodwill allocation in its new reporting units, Chemours evaluated its Chemical Solution segment s reporting units for impairment and determined that the estimated fair values of those reporting units, except for the Sulfur reporting unit, were substantially in excess of their carrying values, indicating that goodwill was not impaired.  Chemours performed the second step of the impairment test for the Sulfur reporting unit and determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a full impairment of the Sulfur reporting unit's goodwill.  As a result, Chemours recorded a   $25   pre-tax impairment charge in the period ended September 30, 2015 in the Chemicals Solutions segment. 
  Chemours tests goodwill for impairment at least annually on October 1; however, impairment tests are performed more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  Impairment exists when carrying value exceeds fair value.  Evaluating goodwill for impairment is a two-step process.  In the first step, Chemours compares the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations.  If the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment.  Chemours estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at a risk-adjusted market rate, including a growth

rate to calculate the terminal value.  The Company s forecasted future cash flows, which incorporate anticipated future revenue growth and related expenses to support the growth, were used to calculate fair value.  The factors considered in determining the cash flows include: 1) macroeconomic conditions; 2) industry and market considerations; 3) costs of raw materials, labor or other costs having a negative effect on earnings and cash flows; 4) overall financial performance; and 5) other relevant entity-specific events.  The discount rate used represents the weighted average cost of capital for the reporting units considering the risks and uncertainty inherent in the cash flows of the reporting units and in the internally developed forecasts.  The implied fair value of the goodwill in step two was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting units to all of the assets and liabilities as if the reporting units had been acquired in a business combination and its fair value was the purchase price paid to be acquired.  The use of these unobservable inputs resulted in the fair value estimate being classified as a Level 3 asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to its original recognition. 
  The determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units.  Chemours believes that assumptions and rates used in the impairment assessment are reasonable.  However, these assumptions are judgmental and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value.  The Company will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of October 1, and whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in operating results, market conditions or changes in management s business strategy, indicate that there may be a probable indicator of impairment.  It is possible that the assumptions used by management related to the evaluation may change or that actual results may vary significantly from management s estimates.  
  Intangible Assets, Net:    The following table summarizes the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of other intangible assets by major class: 

1     
    Represents non-cash favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with the sale of Sulfur business and recognized during the third quarter of 2016 based on the present value of the difference between their contractual cash flows and estimated cash flows had the contracts been executed at a determinable market price.  These contract intangibles will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the supply contracts through 2021. 
     The aggregate amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was approximately   $1   and   $2   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately $  1   and $  3   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging from   5   to   20   years.  There are no material indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
  The estimated amortization for the remainder of 2016 and each of the succeeding four years is:

Note 14. Other Assets 

1       Relates to Sulfur business which was included in the assets disposed as of   September 30, 2016  .  See Direct Financing Leases below. 
   2       Pension assets represent the funded status of certain of the Company's long-term employee benefit plans.   
   3       Miscellaneous includes deferred financing fees related to the Revolving Credit Facility of   $14   and   $19   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Direct Financing Leases 
  Prior to the sale of the Sulfur business, Chemours had constructed fixed assets on land that it leased from third parties at two of its facilities in the U.S. (Borderland and Morses Mill).  Management has analyzed these arrangements and determined these assets represent direct financing leases, whereby Chemours was the lessor of this equipment.  Lease receivables were recorded, which represent the balance of the minimum future lease payments.  The current portion of lease receivables was previously included in accounts and notes receivable - trade, net, as shown in Note 10 and the long-term portion was previously included in other assets, as shown above.  These lease receivables were included in the sale of the Sulfur business that was completed as of   September 30, 2016   (see Note 6). 
   
  Note 15. Debt 
  Long-term debt was comprised of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Senior Secured Credit Facilities  
  During the first quarter of 2016, Chemours and its Revolving Credit Facility lenders entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement that (a) replaced the total net leverage ratio financial covenant with a senior secured net leverage ratio financial covenant; (b) reduced the minimum levels required by the interest expense coverage ratio covenant; (c) increased the limits and extended

the period of adding back the benefits of announced cost reduction initiatives in the determination of Consolidated EBITDA for the purposes of calculating the financial maintenance covenants; and (d) reduced the revolver commitment from   $1,000   to   $750  .  As a result of the amendment, the Company recorded a charge of approximately   $4   to write off a proportionate amount of unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to the reduction in revolver commitment, which was included in  Interest expense, net .  Fees and expenses of approximately   $2   incurred in connection with the amendment were capitalized in  Other assets  of the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets, which will be amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  The credit agreement contains financial covenants which, solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility as amended, require Chemours not to exceed a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio of   3.50   to 1.00 each quarter through December 31, 2016,   3.00   to 1.00 through June 30, 2017 and further decreasing by   0.25   to 1.00 every subsequent six months to   2.00   to 1.00 by January 1, 2019 and thereafter. Chemours is also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of   1.75   to 1.00 each quarter through June 30, 2017 and further increasing by   0.25   to 1.00 every subsequent six months to   3.00   to 1.00 by January 1, 2019 and thereafter.  In addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict Chemours and its subsidiaries  ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur liens, merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets, make investments, pay dividends, transact with subsidiaries and incur indebtedness.  The credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default.  Chemours was in compliance with its debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Senior Unsecured Notes  
  Chemours entered into a registration rights agreement in connection with the issuance on May 12, 2015 of   $1,350   aggregate principal amount of its   6.625%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the  2023 Notes ),   $750   aggregate principal amount of its   7.000%   Senior Notes due 2025 (the  2025 Notes ) and    360   aggregate principal amount of its   6.125%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the  Euro Notes,  and together with the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the  Notes ).  Under the registration rights agreement, Chemours agreed to file with the SEC, a registration statement for the exchange of the Notes for new registered notes with identical terms.  On March 18, 2016, Chemours filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the exchange offer.  The registration statement was declared effective on April 12, 2016, and the exchange offer was completed on May 19, 2016.  In addition, on May 5, 2016, the Euro Notes were listed for trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. 
  Term Loans and Notes Repayments 
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased portions of its senior secured term loans ( Term Loans ), 2023 Notes and Euro Notes with aggregate principal and cash payment amounts as follows: 

For the three and nine months period ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded in  Interest expense, net  of the Consolidated Statements of Operations a net gain on extinguishment of debt of   $4   and   $10  , respectively, net of approximately   $1   and   $3   charges related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt, respectively. 
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased additional 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $76   for   $75   in cash and additional Euro Notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $31   for   $29   in cash, completing approximately   $315   in total long-term debt repurchases to date. 
  Maturities 
  There are no debt maturities prior to 2022, except, in accordance with the credit agreement, Chemours has required quarterly  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  
  The Chemours Company 
  NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share) 

principal payments related to the Term Loan Facility equivalent to   1.00%   per annum through March 2022, with the balance due at maturity.  Term Loan principal maturities over the next five years are   $4   for the remainder of 2016 and   $15   in each year from 2017 to 2021.  Debt maturities related to the Term Loans and the Notes in 2022 and beyond will be   $3,698  . 
  In addition, following the end of each fiscal year commencing on the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company is also required to make additional principal repayments, depending on leverage levels as defined in the credit agreement, equivalent to up to   50%   of excess cash flow based on certain leverage targets with stepdowns to   25%   and   0%   as actual leverage decreases to below   3.00   to 1.00 leverage target. 
  Debt Fair Value 
  The fair values of the Term Loans, the 2023 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the Euro Notes at   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $1,423  ,   $1,208  ,   $736   and   $333  , respectively.  The estimated fair values of the Term Loans and the Notes are based on quotes received from third party brokers, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
   
  Note 16. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities    
  Guarantees 
  Chemours has directly guaranteed various obligations of customers, suppliers and other third parties.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that Chemours could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed parties is approximately   $8   and   $8  , respectively.  No amounts were accrued at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Litigation  
  In addition to the matters discussed below, Chemours, by virtue of its status as a subsidiary of DuPont prior to the separation, is subject to or required under the separation-related agreements executed prior to the separation to indemnify DuPont against various pending legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of the Chemours business including product liability, intellectual property, commercial, environmental and antitrust lawsuits.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings.  Except for the PFOA litigation for which a separate assessment is provided in this Note, while management believes it is reasonably possible that Chemours could incur losses in excess of the amounts accrued, if any, for the aforementioned proceedings, it does not believe any such loss would have a material impact on Chemours' consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  With respect to the litigation matters discussed below, including PFOA litigation, management's estimate of the probability of loss in excess of the amounts accrued, if any, is addressed individually for each matter.  In the event that DuPont seeks indemnification for adverse trial rulings or outcomes for any such matter relating to PFOA, these indemnification claims could materially adversely affect Chemours  financial condition. Disputes between Chemours and DuPont may also arise with respect to indemnification matters, including disputes based on matters of law or contract interpretation, or related to the type of damages or liabilities for which indemnification may be sought. If and to the extent these disputes arise, they could materially adversely affect Chemours.  
  (a) Asbestos 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were approximately   1,982   lawsuits and   2,212   lawsuits, respectively, pending against DuPont alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. These cases are pending in state and federal court in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and are individually set for trial.  A small number of cases are pending outside the U.S.  Most of the actions were brought by contractors who worked at sites between 1950 and the 1990s. A small number of cases involve similar allegations by DuPont employees. A limited number of the cases were brought by household members of contractors or DuPont employees. Finally, certain lawsuits allege personal injury as a result of exposure to DuPont products.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Chemours had an accrual of    $44   related to this matter.  Chemours reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of an approximate 20-year projection.  Management believes that the likelihood is remote that Chemours would incur losses in excess of the amounts accrued in connection with this matter.

(b) Benzene  
  In the separation, DuPont assigned its Benzene docket to Chemours.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there are   26   and   29   cases, respectively, pending against DuPont alleging benzene-related illnesses.  These cases consist of premises matters involving contractors and deceased former employees who claim exposure to benzene while working at DuPont sites primarily in the 1960s through the 1980s, and product liability claims based on alleged exposure to benzene found in trace amounts in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents used to manufacture DuPont products, such as paints, thinners and reducers. 
  Through DuPont, Chemours has received a claim by Phillips66 for indemnity and defense for two matters arising at a former DuPont / Conoco Texas site.  Phillips66 seeks reimbursement for its settlement and fees in one matter and assumption of the defense in another.  
  A benzene case (Hood v. DuPont) was tried to a verdict in Texas state court in October 2015.  Plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Hood s Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) was the result of 24 years of occupational exposure to trace benzene found in DuPont automotive paint products and that DuPont negligently failed to warn him that its paints, reducers and thinners contained benzene that could cause cancer or leukemia. The jury found in the Plaintiffs  favor awarding   $6.9   in compensatory damages and   $1.5   in punitive damages.  In March 2016, acting on the Company's motion, the Court struck the punitive award.  Through DuPont, Chemours has filed an appeal on the remaining award based upon substantial errors made at the trial court level.  Plaintiffs have filed a cross appeal.   
  Management believes that a loss is reasonably possible related to these matters; however, given the evaluation of each Benzene matter is highly fact driven and impacted by disease, exposure and other factors, a range of such losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.   
  (c) PFOA 
  Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the performance chemicals segment of DuPont made PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acids and its salts, including the ammonium salt) at its Fayetteville plant (Fayetteville, North Carolina) and used PFOA as a processing aid in the manufacture of fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers at certain sites including: Washington Works (Parkersburg, West Virginia), Chambers Works (Deepwater, New Jersey), Dordrecht Works (Netherlands), Changshu Works (China), and Shimizu (Japan).  These sites are now owned and/or operated by Chemours. 
  Chemours had accruals of   $17   and   $20   related to the PFOA matters discussed below at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The accruals include charges related to DuPont s obligations under agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and voluntary commitments to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). These obligations and voluntary commitments include surveying, sampling and testing drinking water in and around certain company sites offering treatment or an alternative supply of drinking water if tests indicate the presence of PFOA in drinking water at or greater than the national Health Advisory. A provisional health advisory level was set in 2009 at 0.4 parts per billion (ppb) that includes PFOA in drinking water.  In May 2016, the EPA announced a health advisory level of 0.07 ppb that includes PFOA in drinking water.  As a result, we recorded an additional   $4   in the second quarter of 2016 based on management's best estimate of the impact of the new health advisory level on the company s obligations to the EPA, which have expanded the testing and water supply commitments previously established.  Based on prior testing, the Company has initiated additional testing and treatment in certain additional locations in and around Chambers Works and Washington Works plants.  The Company will continue to work with the EPA regarding the extent of work that may be required with respect to these matters. 
  Drinking Water Actions 
  In August 2001, a class action, captioned Leach v. DuPont, was filed in West Virginia state court alleging that residents living near the Washington Works facility had suffered, or may suffer, deleterious health effects from exposure to PFOA in drinking water. 
  DuPont and attorneys for the class reached a settlement in 2004 that binds about   80,000   residents. In 2005, DuPont paid the plaintiffs  attorneys  fees and expenses of   $23   and made a payment of   $70  , which class counsel designated to fund a community health project. Chemours, through DuPont, funded a series of health studies which were completed in October 2012 by an independent science panel of experts (the C8 Science Panel). The studies were conducted in communities exposed to PFOA to evaluate available scientific evidence on whether any probable link exists, as defined in the settlement agreement, between exposure to PFOA and human disease.  The C8 Science Panel found probable links, as defined in the settlement agreement, between exposure

to PFOA and pregnancy-induced hypertension, including preeclampsia, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis and diagnosed high cholesterol.  
  In May 2013, a panel of three independent medical doctors released its initial recommendations for screening and diagnostic testing of eligible class members. In September 2014, the medical panel recommended follow-up screening and diagnostic testing three years after initial testing, based on individual results. The medical panel has not communicated its anticipated schedule for completion of its protocol. Through DuPont, Chemours is obligated to fund up to   $235   for a medical monitoring program for eligible class members and, in addition, administrative cost associated with the program, including class counsel fees. In January 2012, Chemours, through DuPont, put   $1   in an escrow account to fund medical monitoring as required by the settlement agreement. The court-appointed Director of Medical Monitoring has established the program to implement the medical panel s recommendations and the registration process, as well as eligibility screening, is ongoing. Diagnostic screening and testing has begun and associated payments to service providers are being disbursed from the escrow account.  As of   September 30, 2016  , less than   $1   has been disbursed from the escrow account related to medical monitoring.   
  In addition, under the settlement agreement, DuPont must continue to provide water treatment designed to reduce the level of PFOA in water to six area water districts and private well users.  At separation, this obligation was assigned to Chemours, which is included in the accrual amounts recorded as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Class members may pursue personal injury claims against DuPont only for those human diseases for which the C8 Science Panel determined a probable link exists. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were approximately   3,500   lawsuits filed in various federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia, an increase of approximately   600   over year end   2014  .  These lawsuits are consolidated in multi-district litigation (MDL) in Ohio federal court.  Based on the information currently available to the Company, the majority of the lawsuits allege personal injury claims associated with high cholesterol and thyroid disease from exposure to PFOA in drinking water. There are   30   lawsuits alleging wrongful death. 
  Although the majority of the plaintiffs in the MDL allege multiple diseases, the table below approximates the number of plaintiffs in each of the six probable link disease categories. 

In the third quarter of 2014,   six   plaintiffs from the MDL were selected for individual bellwether trials. 
  All   six   bellwether cases in the MDL have now been tried, resolved, appealed or otherwise addressed.  Two bellwether cases have been tried.  The first case (Bartlett v. DuPont / kidney cancer) was tried to a verdict in October 2015.  The jury found in favor of the plaintiff, awarding   $1.1   in damages for negligence and   $0.5   for emotional distress.  The jury found that DuPont s conduct did not warrant punitive damages.  A second case  (Freeman v. DuPont /  testicular cancer) was tried to verdict in July 2016.  The jury found in favor of the plaintiff awarding   $5.1   in compensatory damages and   $0.5   in punitive damages and attorneys  fees.  Plaintiff s counsel alleges that they are entitled to at least   $6.9   in attorneys  fees and costs for the Freeman trial.  The Court will make a determination after post-trial submissions by the parties. The Court s determination will be subject to appeal.  Court rulings made before and during both trials resulted in several significant grounds for appeal and an appeal to the Sixth Circuit has been filed for the first case.  This appeal is scheduled for oral arguments on December 9, 2016.  The Company, through DuPont, is pursuing post-trial motions and appeals for the second case. 
  Three   bellwether PFOA cases were settled in 2016 as trial approached. These cases (Wolf v. DuPont / ulcerative colitis, Dowdy v. DuPont / kidney cancer, Baker v. DuPont / kidney cancer) were settled for amounts well below the incremental cost of preparing for trials.  To date, the settlements have been individually and in aggregate immaterial to the Company.  The final case (Pugh v. DuPont / ulcerative colitis) was removed from the bellwethers when it was determined that the plaintiff did not suffer from the alleged disease.

  (Dollars in millions, except per share) 

The trial court announced that, starting in May 2017,   40   individual plaintiff trials will be scheduled for a 12-month period.  Following the conclusion of the   six   bellwether cases, on July 19, 2016, the court moved   two   of the   40   matters (Vigneron v. DuPont / testicular cancer and Moody v. DuPont / testicular cancer) forward and set the cases for trial on November 14, 2016 and January 17, 2017, respectively.  The trial court s multi-year plan pertains only to the approximately   270   cases claiming cancer.  Based on the current plan, the remaining cases, comprising approximately   93%   of the docket, will remain inactive. 
  A confidential mediation process that the court established early in this MDL is ongoing and expected to continue as the litigation proceeds. 
  Chemours, through DuPont, denies the allegations in these lawsuits and is defending itself vigorously.  No other claims have been settled or resolved during the periods presented.  DuPont is the named defendant in each of these cases and is directly liable for any judgment. If DuPont were to claim that it is entitled to indemnification from Chemours as to some or all of any judgment, Chemours retains its defenses to such claims. 
  PFOA Summary 
  While it is probable that the Company will incur costs related to the medical monitoring program discussed above, such costs cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties surrounding the level of participation by eligible class members and the scope of testing.  Chemours believes that it is probable that it could incur losses related to the MDL in Ohio federal court discussed above but a range of such losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  Given the wide range of outcomes associated with the   six   initial cases in the MDL as discussed above, including   two   cases that have been or will be appealed, the Company does not believe activity to date provides a reasonable basis to derive a range of loss for the remaining lawsuits still pending in the MDL in total or by category of claim.  The possible range of loss is unpredictable and involves significant uncertainty due to the uniqueness of the individual MDL plaintiff's claims and the defenses to those claims, both as to potential liability and damages on an individual claim basis, and numerous unsettled legal issues, among other factors, such as general versus specific causation, lack of specific fact discovery allowed to date on vast majority of the cases, lack of validation of basic facts associated with plaintiffs and related claims, and the two bellwether cases tried to verdict to date did not inform of the many salient facts and legal issues  needed for assessment of the other cases.  The appellate courts will rule on both matters that have been tried.  The Company believes there are strong common and individual grounds for appealing these verdicts and, if any such verdict is overturned, any subsequent verdict relying on such overturned ruling would likely also be overturned.  In addition, as noted above, Chemours retains its defenses to related indemnification claims that may be received from DuPont.  The trials and appeals of the MDL matters will occur over the course of many years.  Significant unfavorable outcomes in a number of cases in the MDL could have a material adverse effect on Chemours' consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   
  (d) U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc. 
  In October 2016, a putative class action was filed against Chemours by area residents concerning the U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery multi-party Superfund site in East Chicago, Indiana under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) with trespass and negligence causes of action seeking reimbursement for temporary housing, relocation, loss of use and other costs and damages.  DuPont has requested that Chemours defend and indemnify it on this matter and a second matter alleging claims including personal injury to 13 area residents.  Management believes a loss is reasonably possible but not estimable at this time. 
  At separation, DuPont assigned Chemours its former plant site, which is located south of the residential portion of the Superfund area, and its responsibility for the environmental remediation at the Superfund site. 
  Environmental 
  Chemours, by virtue of its status as a subsidiary of DuPont prior to the separation, is subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require further action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or releases of chemical substances by Chemours or other parties. Chemours accrues for environmental remediation activities consistent with the policy set forth in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Much of this liability results from the CERCLA (often referred to as Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) and similar state and global laws. These laws require Chemours to undertake certain investigative, remediation and restoration activities at sites where Chemours conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where Chemours-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes estimated costs related to a number of sites identified for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of enforcement activities.

  NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share) 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets included a liability relating to these matters of   $281   and   $290  , respectively, which, in management s opinion, is appropriate based on existing facts and circumstances. The average time frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be paid, based on past history, is estimated to be   15   to   20 years  .  Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of other potentially responsible parties.  Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to approximately   $600   above the amount accrued at   September 30, 2016  .  Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss related to remediation activities at any individual site, in excess of amounts accrued, will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of Chemours. 
  Pompton Lakes 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , included in the environmental remediation liabilities recorded on the balance sheet are accruals related to activities at Chemours  site in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey of   $84   and   $87  , respectively.  Management believes that it is reasonably possible that remediation activities at this site could range up to   $119   including previously accrued amounts.  During the twentieth century, blasting caps, fuses and related materials were manufactured at Pompton Lakes.  Operating activities at the site were ceased in the mid-1990s. Primary contaminants in the soil and sediments are lead and mercury.  Ground water contaminants include volatile organic compounds.  
  Under the authority of the EPA and the NJDEP, remedial actions at the site are focused on investigating and cleaning up the area. Ground water monitoring at the site is ongoing and Chemours, through DuPont, has installed and continues to install vapor mitigation systems at residences within the ground water plume.  In addition, Chemours is further assessing ground water conditions. In June 2015, the EPA issued a modification to the site's RCRA permit that requires Chemours to dredge mercury contamination from a 36 acre area of the lake and remove sediment from two other areas of the lake near the shoreline. Chemours expects to spend about   $50   over the next   two   to   three   years, which is included in the remediation accrual as of   September 30, 2016  , in connection with remediation activities at Pompton Lakes, including activities related to the EPA s final plan. The remediation activities commenced when permits and implementation plans were approved in May 2016. 
   
  Note 17. Financial Instruments 
  Derivative Instruments 
  Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
  Chemours uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its net exposure, by currency, related to non-functional currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes are minimized.  These derivative instruments are not part of a cash flow hedge program or a fair value hedge program, and have not been designated as a hedge.  Although all of the forward contracts are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, Chemours has elected to present the derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on the balance sheets.  No collateral has been required for these contracts.  All gains and losses resulting from the revaluation of the derivative assets and liabilities are recognized in  other income (expense), net  in the statements of operations during the period in which they occurred. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   61   foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate gross notional value of   $444  .  Chemours recognized in  Other income, net  of the Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations net loss of   $2   and   $2   for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and net gains of   $66   and   $78   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Net Investment Hedge - Foreign Currency Borrowings 
  Beginning July 1, 2015, Chemours designated its    360   Euro Notes (see Note 15) as a hedge of its net investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders  equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar.  Chemours uses the spot method to measure the effectiveness of the net investment hedge. Under this method, for each reporting period, the change in the carrying value of the Euro Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in  other income

(expense), net  in the statements of operations.  Chemours evaluates the effectiveness of its net investment hedge quarterly.  Chemours did not record any ineffectiveness for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The Company recognized a loss of   $6   and   $9   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and a gain of less than   $1   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   on its net investment hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ).  The amount of net investment hedge gains (loss) released from AOCI and charged to  Other income, net  of the Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations, in connection with the repurchase of portion of the Euro Notes in the third quarter of 2016, was insignificant.

We classify our foreign currency forward contracts as Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. For derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance/quality checks. 
   
  Note 18. Long-Term Employee Benefits     
  The components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for all significant pension plans were as follows: 

The net periodic benefit cost (income) is based on estimated values and an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases received by the Company's employees. 
  Chemours made cash contributions of   $4   and   $14   to its pension plans during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and expects to make additional cash contributions of   $4   to the pension plan during the remainder of 2016.

Participation in the DuPont Plans  
  Prior to July 1, 2015, Chemours participated in DuPont s U.S. and non-U.S. benefit plans, except in the Netherlands and Taiwan, as though its employees were participants in a multi-employer plan with the other businesses of DuPont. As a result, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , Chemours recognized   $0   and   $53  , respectively, of pension and other long-term benefit expenses allocated by DuPont based on Chemours' active employee headcount prior to separation. 
   
  Note 19. Stock-based Compensation 
  Total stock-based compensation cost included in the Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations was   $6   and   $16   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $8   and   $13   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements were   $2   and   $6   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3   and   $5   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
  Stock-based compensation expense in prior years and until separation on July 1, 2015 was allocated to Chemours based on the portion of DuPont s incentive stock program in which Chemours employees participated. Adopted at separation, the Chemours Equity and Incentive Plan grants certain employees, independent contractors, or non-employee directors of the Company different forms of awards, including stock options, performance share units (PSUs) and restricted stock units (RSUs). The Equity and Incentive Plan has a maximum shares reserve of   13,500,000   for the grant of equity awards plus the number of shares of DuPont equity awards that converted into new Chemours equity awards.  The Chemours Compensation Committee determines the long-term incentive mix, including stock options, PSUs and RSUs, and may authorize new grants annually.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   8,537,692   shares of the Equity and Incentive Plan reserve are still available for grants.  Subject to vesting conditions of the award, a retirement eligible employee retains any granted awards upon retirement provided the employee has rendered at least   six months   of service following the grant date. 
  Stock Options 
  During 2016, Chemours granted non-qualified options to certain of its employees, which will serially vest over a   three  -year period and expire   10   years from the date of grant.  The expense related to stock options granted in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was based on the weighted-average assumptions shown in the table below:  

The Company determined the dividend yield by dividing the expected annual dividend on the Company's stock by the option exercise price.  A historical daily measurement of volatility is determined based on the average volatility of peer companies adjusted for the Company s debt leverage.  The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the yield on an outstanding U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected life of the option granted.  Expected life is determined using a simplified approach, calculated as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the award.

The following table summarizes Chemours stock option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of   September 30, 2016   and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their in-the-money options at quarter end.  The amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company s stock.  Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was insignificant. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $5   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.80   years. 
  RSUs 
  During 2016, Chemours granted RSUs to key management employees that generally vest over a   three  -year period and, upon vesting, convert   one  -for-one to Chemours common stock.  The fair value of all stock-settled RSUs is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. 
  Non-vested awards of RSUs, both with and without a performance condition, as of   September 30, 2016   are shown below. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $16   of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.77   years. 
  Performance Share Units 
  During 2016, Chemours issued PSUs to key senior management employees which, upon vesting, convert   one  -for-one to Chemours  common stock if specified performance goals, including certain market-based conditions, are met over the   three   year performance period specified in the grant, subject to exceptions through the respective vesting period of   three   years.  Each grantee is granted a target award of PSUs, and may earn between   0%   and   200%   of the target amount depending on the Company s performance against the performance goals. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded stock-based compensation related to PSUs as a component of selling, general and administrative expense of approximately less than   $1   and   $1  , respectively.  There were no PSUs granted prior to   2016  .

  NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Dollars in millions, except per share) 

The following table provides compensation costs for stock-based compensation related to PSUs. 

A portion of the fair value of PSUs was estimated at the grant date based on the probability of satisfying the market-based conditions associated with the PSUs using the Monte Carlo valuation method, which assesses probabilities of various outcomes of market conditions.  The other portion of the fair value of the PSUs is based on the fair market value of the Company s stock at the grant date, regardless of whether the market-based condition is satisfied.  The per unit weighted-average fair value at the date of grant for PSUs granted during the period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.10  .  The fair value of each PSU grant is amortized monthly into compensation expense on a straight-line basis over their respective vesting periods over   36   months. The accrual of compensation costs is based on our estimate of the final expected value of the award, and is adjusted as required for the portion based on the performance-based condition. The Company assumes that forfeitures will be minimal, and recognizes forfeitures as they occur, which results in a reduction in compensation expense.  As the payout of PSUs includes dividend equivalents, no separate dividend yield assumption is required in calculating the fair value of the PSUs. 
   
  Note 20. Segment Information    
  Chemours  operations are classified into   three   reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics, the nature of products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment.  Chemours  reportable segments are Titanium Technologies, Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions.  Corporate costs and certain legal and environmental expenses that are not aligned with the reportable segments and foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in Corporate and Other. 
  Segment sales include transfers to another reportable segment.  Certain products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products.  These product transfers were limited and were not significant for each of the periods presented.  Segment net assets include net working capital, net property, plant and equipment, and other non-current operating assets and liabilities of the segment.  As of September 30, 2016, the Chemical Solutions net assets were reduced by approximately   $415   in connection with the sale of the C D and Sulfur businesses during the period ended September 30, 2016.  See Note 6 for further details. 
  Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ), is the primary measure of segment profitability used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) and is defined as income (loss) before income taxes excluding the following:  
             
    interest expense, depreciation and amortization, 
                
    non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, which represent the components of net periodic pension costs (income) excluding service cost component, 
                
    exchange losses (gains),  
                
    employee separation, asset-related charges and other charges, net,  
                
    asset impairments,  
                
    losses (gains) on sale of business or assets, and 
                
    other items not considered indicative of our ongoing operational performance and expected to occur infrequently.

    the Consolidating Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ; 
       As discussed in Note 2, Chemours did not operate as a separate, stand-alone entity for the full period covered by consolidated financial statements.  Prior to our separation on July 1, 2015, Chemours operations were included in DuPont s financial results in different legal forms, including, but not limited to, wholly-owned subsidiaries for which Chemours was the sole business, components of legal entities in which Chemours operated in conjunction with other DuPont businesses and a majority owned joint venture.  For periods prior to July 1, 2015, the condensed consolidating financial information have been prepared from DuPont s historical accounting records and are presented on a stand-alone basis as if the business operations had been conducted independently from DuPont. 
  The condensed consolidating financial information is presented using the equity method of accounting for the Company s investments in 100% owned subsidiaries.  Under the equity method, the investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of the subsidiaries cumulative results of operations, capital contributions, distributions and other equity changes.  The elimination entries principally eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.  The financial information in this footnote should be read in conjunction with the interim consolidated financial statements presented and other notes related thereto contained in this quarterly report. 
  As discussed in Note 6, the Company entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement with Lanxess, pursuant to which Lanxess acquired the Company s C D business comprise of certain assets and subsidiaries of the Company, including International Dioxcide, Inc., which was a guarantor subsidiary.

  Overview 
  Chemours is a leading global provider of products that are key inputs in end-products and processes in a variety of industries. We deliver customized solutions with a wide range of industrial and specialty chemical products for markets including plastics and coatings, refrigeration and air conditioning, general industrial, mining and oil refining. Principal products include titanium dioxide ( TiO   2    ), refrigerants, industrial fluoropolymer resins and a portfolio of industrial chemicals including sodium cyanide.  
  Chemours manages and reports operating results through three reportable segments: Titanium Technologies, Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions. Our position with each of these businesses reflects the strong value proposition we provide to our customers based on our long history and reputation in the chemical industry for safety, quality and reliability.  
  Chemours Five-Point Transformation Plan 
  Immediately after Chemours became an independent public company, we began to make changes to our organization, cost structure and portfolio of businesses in order to transform our company into a higher growth chemistry company. The objectives of our multi-year five-point transformation plan are to improve our financial performance, streamline and strengthen our portfolio and reduce our leverage by: 
  1. Reducing our costs through a simpler business model; 
  2. Optimizing our portfolio to focus on our businesses where we have leading positions; 
  3. Growing our market positions where we have competitive advantages; 
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

4. Refocusing our investments by concentrating our capital expenditures on our core businesses; and 
  5. Enhancing our organization to deliver our values and support our transformation to a higher-value chemistry company. 
  Through cost reduction and growth, Chemours expects the transformation plan to deliver $500 million of incremental Adjusted EBITDA improvement over 2015 through 2017.  Based on our anticipated cost reduction and growth initiatives, we expect that our cost savings of approximately $350 million and approximately $150 million in improvements from growth initiatives will also improve our pre-tax earnings by similar amounts through 2017.  Results of our transformation actions are discussed in the Recent Developments, Results of Operations, Segment Reviews and Outlook sections of this MD A. 
   
  Recent Developments 
  On June 13, 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Veolia North America ( Veolia ), pursuant to which Veolia agreed to acquire Chemours  Sulfur Products business ( Sulfur business ) of its Chemical Solutions segment for a purchase price of $325 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments, of which approximately $10 million was received in May 2016.  The Company completed the sale on July 29, 2016 and received the remaining proceeds of approximately $311 million, net of estimated working capital adjustments.  The sale is still subject to certain customary post-closing conditions. 
  On April 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with LANXESS Corporation ( Lanxess ), pursuant to which Lanxess has agreed to acquire Chemours  Clean   Disinfect product line (the  C D business ) by acquiring certain Chemours' subsidiaries and assets comprising the C D business for a purchase price of $230 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments.  The Company completed the sale on August 31, 2016 and received $223 million of cash, net of working capital adjustments and approximately   $2   of cash transferred.  The sale is still subject to certain customary post-closing conditions. 
  The Company expects to use the proceeds from the above sales to fund our future capital expenditures. 
   
  Our Third Quarter 2016 Results and Business Highlights 
  Net sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $1.4 billion  ,   a decrease   of   6%   from   $1.5 billion   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $4.1 billion  ,   a decrease   of   6%   from   $4.4 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2015  .  These decreases were driven primarily by the portfolio changes from divestitures in the Chemical Solutions segment described below. 
  We recognized net income of   $204 million   and   $237 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with a net loss of   $29 million   and   $4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Our results for the quarter reflect   $172 million   of gain on sale of the C D business, improvements from cost reductions initiatives, improved TiO   2    pricing, and strong Fluoroproducts performance, partially offset by asset impairment charges of   $46 million   and   $104 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, in the Chemical Solutions segment. 
  Our Adjusted EBITDA was   $268 million   and   $169 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $583 million   and   $441 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our results for the 2016 periods reflect improvements in average prices in Titanium Technologies and improved profitability in Fluoroproducts, including growth in Opteon   TM    sales, partially offset by the impact of divestitures within the Chemical Solutions segment.

Results of Operations 

Net Sales 
  Net sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $1.4 billion  ,   a decrease   of approximately   6%   compared to   $1.5 billion   in the same period in   2015  .  Net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $4.1 billion  ,   a decrease   of approximately   6%     compared to   $4.4 billion   in the same period in 2015. 
  The decreases in net sales in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were driven by portfolio changes from divestitures and lower selling prices resulting from the impact of lower raw materials costs on contractual pass-through terms in the Chemical Solutions segment.  In addition, decrease in net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were also impacted by lower selling prices for TiO   2     in the Titanium Technologies segment year over year.  In the Fluoroproducts segment, the growth in Opteon   TM    was offset by weaker demand and unfavorable product mix of fluoropolymer products. 
  The table below shows the impact of price, volume, currency and portfolio changes on net sales for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  : 

For detailed discussion of net sales, see the Segment Reviews section of this MD A. 
  Cost of goods sold  
  Cost of goods sold (COGS)   decreased   by   14%   and   10%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in   2015  .  The decreases were primarily driven by lower operating costs, including lower raw

     Table of Contents  

materials and overhead costs, and improvement in plant utilization, which decreased COGS by approximately 9% and 7% for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Portfolio changes primarily in our Chemical Solutions segment also decreased COGS by approximately 5% and 2% for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  These decreases were partially offset by inventory write-downs in the Chemical Solutions segment of $2 million and $7 million in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as a result of the previously announced reactive metals solution restructuring, $5 million assets write-off related to the cyanides business of our Chemical Solutions segment in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and a $6 million increase in performance related compensation accruals in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Selling, general and administrative expense 
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense   decreased   by   6%   to   $148 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   decreased   by   6%   to   $454 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same periods in   2015  . 
  The decrease in SG A for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was due to our cost reduction initiatives, including a global workforce reduction and other initiatives in connection with the transformation plan, that contributed to an approximate 12% reduction in SG A.  The decrease was partially offset by increase in performance related compensation accruals by approximately $5 million, and legal settlements and related costs of   $2 million  . 
  The decrease in SG A in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by lower pension costs and cost reduction initiatives, including the global workforce reduction and other initiatives in connection with the transformation plan, which contributed to an approximate 17% reduction in SG A.  These decreases were partially offset by increased performance related compensation accruals of approximately $25 million, transaction costs incurred primarily in connection with the sale of the C D and Sulfur businesses of   $18 million   and legal settlements and related costs of   $11 million  . 
  Research and development expense 
  Research and development (R D) expense increased by   $1 million   and decreased by   $8 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2015. 
  R D spend was driven by decisions to refocus on fewer higher return projects.  The global workforce reduction initiative also impacted the R D function, which contributed to the decrease in R D expense in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Restructuring and asset-related charges, net 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded pre-tax charges of approximately   $60 million   and   $145 million  , respectively, compared to   $184 million   and   $245 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, for employee separation, decommissioning and other asset-related charges in connection with several restructuring actions initiated in the second half of 2015.  
  Charges in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consist primarily of   $5 million   and   $24 million  , respectively, of decommissioning and dismantling activities related to the closure of Edge Moor manufacturing plant in Titanium Technology segment,   $1 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, of decommissioning activities related to certain production lines in Fluoroproducts segment, and   $7 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, of contract termination and decommissioning activities related to the reactive metals solution ( RMS ) manufacturing facility in Chemical Solutions segment.  We also recorded in the Chemical Solutions segment   $46 million   of asset impairment charge in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the aniline facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and   $58 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   of asset impairment charges in connection with the sale of the Sulfur business. 
  Charges for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   consist primarily of asset related charges of   $114 million   in the Titanium Technologies segment related to the write-off of substantially all of the Edge Moor plant assets  carrying value,   $8 million   in the Fluoroproducts segment related to property, plant and equipment accelerated depreciation, and   $45 million   in the Chemical Solutions segment related to the RMS manufacturing facility asset impairment.  We also recorded   $17 million   and   $78 million   of employee separation costs in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to the plant and product line closures for the Titanium Technologies and Fluoroproducts segments, and the 2015 restructuring program. 
  For details related to the  Restructuring and asset related charges, net , see Note 5 to the interim consolidated financial statements.

Interest expense, net  
  We incurred interest expense of   $51 million   and   $157 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $51 million   and   $79 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   includes approximately   $4 million   of gain on debt extinguishment during the third quarter of 2016, offset by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of our Altamira plant expansion in April 2016. 
  Interest expense is higher in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   because the related long-term debt was outstanding for the full nine months in 2016 compared to 2015 when the long-term debt was issued in May 2015.  In addition, we recorded approximately   $4 million   of non-cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to the reduction in our revolver commitment during the first quarter of 2016.  These increases were partially offset by approximately   $10 million   of gain on debt extinguishment in 2016 (see Note 15 to the interim consolidated financial statements).  
  Other income, net 
  Other income, net   increased   by   $104 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   increased   by   $179 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015  .   
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , other income primarily includes a   $169 million   gain on sale primarily in connection with the sale of our C D business, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses of   $17 million   driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Mexican peso, compared to a foreign currency exchange gain of   $44 million   in 2015, which was mainly driven by a net gain from foreign currency forward contracts. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , other income primarily includes a   $258 million   gain on sale primarily in connection with the sale of our C D business and the sale of our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses of approximately   $37 million    driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the Mexican peso compared to a foreign currency exchange gain of   $47 million    in 2015, which was mainly driven by the net gain from foreign currency forward contracts. 
  For additional details of other income, net and foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 7 and Note 17 to the interim consolidated financial statements. 
  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Chemours recorded a provision for income tax of   $30 million   and a benefit from income tax of   $78 million  , respectively, or an effective income tax rate of approximately   13%   and   73%  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Chemours recorded a provision for income tax of   $25 million   and a benefit from income tax of   $63 million  , respectively, or an effective income tax rate of   9%   and   94%  , respectively. 
  The   $108 million   and   $88 million     increase   in provision for income tax for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and the corresponding changes in the effective income tax rates were primarily due to the Company s geographical mix of earnings.  The gain on the sale of assets and business (see Note 6) resulted in an increase in tax expense and a corresponding change in the effective income tax rate for the period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the period ended   September 30, 2015  .  These increases in tax provision were partially offset by restructuring charges, asset impairments and foreign currency exchange losses recognized in the period ended   September 30, 2016  .

Segment Reviews 
  The following table represents Chemours  total consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by segment: 

Adjusted EBITDA represents our primary measure of segment performance and is defined as income (loss) before income taxes excluding the following:  
             
    interest expense, depreciation and amortization, 
                
    non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, which represent the components of net periodic pension costs (income) excluding service cost component 
                
    exchange losses (gains),  
                
    employee separation, asset-related charges and other charges, net,  
                
    asset impairments,  
                
    losses (gains) on sale of business or assets, and 
                
    other items not considered indicative of our ongoing operational performance and expected to occur infrequently.  
     A tabular reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is included in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Item 2. 
  Titanium Technologies 

Segment Net Sales:    Net sales   increased   by   1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and decreased by   3%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared with the same periods in   2015  . 
  The increase in sales in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to improvement in global average selling prices during 2016.  Our TiO   2    sales volume also increased in the third quarter by approximately 2% due to the higher demand in all regions except China, offset by lower volumes in non-TiO   2    products. 
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in net sales in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to lower average selling prices year over year, partially offset by an increase in sales volume due to higher demand in Europe and the United States.  Our sales volume in 2016 was in line with seasonal and historical trends while 2015 experienced an unusually low volume particularly in the first quarter. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin:    Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin   increased   during the three and nine months   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of approximately   80%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and the corresponding increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by selling price increases and productivity improvement initiatives, which increased Adjusted EBITDA by approximately 14% and 68%, respectively.  The productivity improvement initiatives resulted in lower raw materials and plant operating costs. 
  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA of approximately   17%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and the corresponding increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by productivity improvement initiatives including the impact of the Edge Moor plant shut-down and global headcount reductions, which increased Adjusted EBITDA by approximately 56%.  The productivity improvement initiatives resulted in lower raw materials and lower plant operating costs.  The increase was partially offset by lower average selling price year-over-year, which decreased adjusted EBITDA by approximately 42%. 
  Fluoroproducts 

Segment Net Sales:    Net sales   increased   by   3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and decreased by   1%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   in comparison with the same period in   2015  .  Stronger demand for Opteon  refrigerant in both Europe and the United States delivered a significant increase in volume over the prior period, partially offset by lower volume over the prior period due to the phase down of HCFCs refrigerants (i.e., Freon )  as stipulated by the Montreal Protocol, and by lower selling prices for fluoropolymer products due to competitive pricing pressure.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily against the Euro and Brazilian real resulted in an overall decrease in net sales. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin:   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin   increased   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively,when compared to the same periods in 2015.   
  Adjusted EBITDA increased by   57%   and   51%   during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due primarily to margin improvements and cost reductions from cost savings initiatives.  Margin improvement from fluorochemicals sales, including growth in Opteon  but excluding currency impact, contributed an increase of approximately 40% and 32% in the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, while cost reduction initiatives contributed an increase of approximately 20% and 29% for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  In addition, we incurred approximately $22 million or approximately 10% of incremental costs in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   due to plant

outages in certain of our manufacturing facilities in the United States that did not recur in 2016.  These improvements were partially offset by lower selling price and unfavorable product mix of fluoropolymers.  Overall unfavorable currency in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   also resulted in a decrease in adjusted EBITDA by approximately 11%. 
  Chemical Solutions 

Segment Net Sales:    Net sales   decreased   by   38%   and   24%   in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   respectively, compared with the same periods in   2015  .  These decreases were primarily due to a portfolio change resulting from the sale of our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas, our C D business and our Sulfur business.  In addition, sales decreased due to lower selling prices resulting from the impact of lower raw materials costs on contractual pass-through terms, and lower sales volume across all business units except Sulfur during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   due to soft demand. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin:    Adjusted EBITDA   increased   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   increased   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in 2015. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million reflecting lower operating costs partially offset by the impacts of the divestitures.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , despite the decreases in net sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased due primarily to the cost reduction efforts, including the global headcount reductions implemented in 2015, and improvement in plant operating costs.  
   
  2016 Outlook 
  With our transformation plan on track, we are achieving our anticipated cost reductions primarily from actions taken during 2015 including facilities closures, headcount reductions, procurement and productivity enhancements, suspension of 2016 annual salary increases globally, subject to contractual and legal limitations, and suspension of discretionary contribution component in our U.S. 401(k) plan; and additional cost reduction initiatives during 2016.  Based on our anticipated cost reduction and growth initiatives, we continue to expect cost savings of approximately $350 million and approximately $150 million in improvements from growth initiatives that together will also improve our pre-tax earnings by similar amounts through 2017.  To date, we have achieved approximately $160 million in cost savings and we continue to implement additional cost reduction initiatives to realize our target of reducing structural costs. 
  For the remainder of 2016, we believe that those cost reductions and our growth initiatives in our transformation plan along with TiO   2    price increases will deliver full year Adjusted EBITDA between $740 million and $775 million based on a net income range of approximately $265 million to $290 million.  We expect our full year capital expenditures in 2016 to approach $350 million primarily due to the shift in the timing of the cyanide expansion and more efficient spending.  We continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full year 2016.  Our outlook reflects our current visibility and expectations on our strategic actions and market factors, such as currency movements, TiO   2    pricing, and end-market demand.

  Liquidity   Capital Resources 
  Chemours  primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and borrowings under the credit facilities as described below.  We believe these sources are sufficient to fund our planned operations and to meet our interest, dividend and contractual obligations. Our financial policy seeks to deleverage by using free cash flow and proceeds from asset sales to repay outstanding borrowings, selectively invest for growth to enhance our portfolio including certain strategic capital investments, and return cash to shareholders through dividend payments.  
  Chemours  operating cash flow generation is driven by, among other things, global economic conditions generally and the resulting impact on demand for our products, raw material and energy prices, and industry-specific issues, such as production capacity and utilization. Chemours has generated strong operating cash flow through various industry and economic cycles evidencing the operating strength of our businesses. Over the industry cycles in recent years, cash flows from operating activities increased in years leading up to the historical peak profitability achieved in 2011, and have decreased annually since that time. Despite the challenging market conditions in the TiO   2    industry since the historical peak profitability in 2011, we anticipate that through our cost reduction efforts and growth initiatives, our operations will provide sufficient liquidity to implement the transformation plan and support cash needs for the business. 
  Over the next 12 months, we expect to make interest payments, capital expenditures, principal repayments, and restructuring payments.  We may also use our available cash to reduce our indebtedness, to the extent permitted, and improve our leverage position.  We expect to fund these payments through cash generated from operations, asset dispositions, available cash and borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  We anticipate that our operations and revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity over the next 12 months.  The availability under our Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the last 12 months of our consolidated EBITDA as defined under the credit agreement. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $577 million   and   $271 million  , respectively, of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet held by our foreign subsidiaries, all of which is readily convertible into currencies used in our operations, including the U.S. dollar.  Cash and earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are generally used to finance their operations and capital expenditures.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States, and it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States.  No deferred tax liabilities have been recognized with regard to the approximately   $577 million   and   $271 million   of cash of our foreign subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and undistributed earnings.  The potential tax implications of the repatriation of unremitted earnings are driven by facts at the time of distribution, therefore, it is not practicable to estimate the income tax liabilities that might be incurred if such cash and earnings were repatriated to the United States. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities. 

Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by operating activities improved by   $444 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015   due primarily to working capital improvements and the advance payment of $190 million that we received from DuPont in February 2016 of which approximately $97 million has been utilized during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Partially offsetting the increase was interest payments in 2016 of approximately $130 million versus approximately $22 million in 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Investing Activities 
  Cash provided by investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes the   $140 million   proceeds from the sale of our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas,   $321 million   net proceeds from the sale of the Sulfur business and   $223 million   net proceeds from the sale of the C D business (see Note 6 to the interim consolidated financial statements for further details), as well as $22 million proceeds from a sale of land in Repauno, New Jersey.  These cash inflows were offset by capital expenditures during the period of   $235 million  .  Our capital expenditures decreased by approximately   $157 million   when compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower spending primarily from the completion of our Altamira plant expansion in April 2016 and no separation-related expenditures incurred during 2016. 
  We expect our full year capital expenditures in 2016 to approach $350 million primarily due to the shift in the timing of the cyanide expansion. 
  Financing Activities 
  Through the third quarter 2016, utilizing our available cash, we repurchased a portion of our senior secured term loans with an aggregate principal amount of   $50 million   for   $49 million   in cash, a portion of our 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $116 million   for   $107 million   in cash, and a portion of our Euro Notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $42 million   for   $39 million   in cash.  These senior loan repurchases were in addition to our quarterly required repayments on the senior secured term loans equivalent to 1% per annum of its original principal.  We also declared and paid approximately   $16 million   of dividends to our shareholders, equivalent to   $0.09   per share.  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased additional 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $76 million   for   $75 million   in cash and additional Euro Notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $31 million   for   $29 million   in cash, completing approximately   $315 million   in total long-term debt repurchases to date. 
  Through June 2015, DuPont managed Chemours  cash and financing arrangements and all excess cash generated through earnings were deemed remitted to DuPont and all sources of cash were deemed funded by DuPont.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, Chemours had a net transfer to DuPont of approximately   $2.9 billion  .  Also, during that period, Chemours remitted approximately $3.4 billion to DuPont in the form of a dividend, using cash received from issuance of debt and paid   $100 million   of dividends to shareholders.  These cash outflows were partially offset by $247 million of cash provided by DuPont at June 30, 2015 pursuant to the separation agreement. 
  Current Assets 

Accounts and notes receivable - trade, net at   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $22 million   compared to   December 31, 2015   primarily due to an increase sales in the third quarter of 2016 over fourth quarter of 2015 and favorable currency translation of approximately $11 million.  These increases were offset by approximately   $22 million   of accounts receivable disposed in connection with the sale of C D and Sulfur businesses. 
  Inventories at   September 30, 2016     decreased     $126 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease was due to the continued effort to reduce inventory on hand as well as due to the lower raw material and production costs.  In addition, we recorded approximately $7 million of inventory write-down in the Chemical Solutions segment in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as a result of the previously announced RMS restructuring, and approximately   $17 million   of inventory disposed in connection with the sale of our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas and sale of C D and Sulfur businesses, partially offset by approximately $6 million favorable currency translation.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets at   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $31 million   compared to   December 31, 2015   due to sale of our aniline facility in Beaumont, Texas in February 2016, which was previously classified as assets held-for-sale for approximately $46 million and included in this account as of December 31, 2015.  This decrease was offset by the prepayment of our annual insurance premium during the third quarter of 2016. 
  Current Liabilities 

As of   September 30, 2016  , accounts payable   decreased   by $138 million compared to   December 31, 2015   due to lower capital expenditures, lower inventories and timing of payments to vendors. 
  Other accrued liabilities   increased   due to the advance payment we received from DuPont in February 2016, which was recorded as a deferred liability and approximately   $93 million   of this prepayment remains outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , and net accrued interest of approximately $38 million.  These increases were partially offset by approximately   $56 million   of severance payments during the year. 
  Credit Facilities and Notes 
  Our credit agreement (as amended) provides a total revolver commitment under the revolving credit facility of $750 million.  The proceeds of loans made under the revolving credit facility can be used to finance capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes.  Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain covenant limitations.  At   September 30, 2016  , the facility had a full borrowing capacity of $750 million, from which we had $141 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under this facility.  
  In September 2015, in connection with the Company's transformation plan announced in August 2015, we undertook a first amendment to the credit agreement to allow pro forma inclusion of future benefits from cost savings initiatives in the calculation of financial covenants that rely on consolidated EBITDA beginning from the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Since the revolver availability in any quarter is determined by the cushion remaining in the financial maintenance covenants at the end of the previous quarter, this amendment increased our access to the revolving credit facility.  
  In February 2016, we proactively pursued a second amendment to the credit agreement in order to ensure that we would retain adequate liquidity and sufficient cushion in the event of an unexpected, further significant decline in TiO   2    pricing. The second amendment also provided further flexibility by allowing us to include, on a pro forma basis, future benefits of cost savings initiatives in the calculation of financial covenants that rely on consolidated EBITDA for an additional year, and increased the amount of the applicable cost savings benefits that could be utilized in the covenant calculation.  In addition, the second amendment replaced the total net leverage ratio with senior secured net leverage ratio and modified the minimum required levels of the interest expense coverage ratio.  These changes were designed to allow us to have full access to the revolving credit facility, provide flexibility to execute our transformation plan through 2017 and provide additional cushion in the event of an unexpected, further significant decline in TiO   2    pricing.  Furthermore, the amendment reduced the size of the revolving credit facility by $250 million to $750 million.   With the on-going efforts to improve working capital usage as a part of our transformation plan, we believe that $750 million of revolver access will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash needs over the next 12 months. 
  The credit agreement, as amended, contains financial covenants which, solely with respect to the revolving credit facility, require us not to exceed a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 each quarter through December 31, 2016, 3.00 to 1.00 through June 30, 2017 and further decreasing by 0.25 to 1.00 every subsequent six months to 2.00 to 1.00 by January 1, 2019 and thereafter. We are also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.75 to 1.00 each quarter through June 30, 2017 and further increasing by 0.25 to 1.00 every subsequent six months to 3.00 to 1.00 by January 1, 2019 and thereafter.  In addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict us  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

and our subsidiaries  ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur liens, merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets, make investments, pay dividends, transact with subsidiaries and incur indebtedness.  The credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default.  The senior secured credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes contain events of default customary for these types of financings, including cross default and cross acceleration provisions to material indebtedness of Chemours.  We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In the event of default under the revolving credit facility, our lenders under the revolving credit facility can terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further revolving loans and accelerate outstanding revolving loans.  This would allow the lenders under the revolving credit facility to declare the outstanding term loans to be immediately due and payable and to institute foreclosure proceedings against the collateral securing the credit facility, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.  Any event of default or declaration of acceleration under the credit agreement also may result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes.  Any such default, event of default or declaration of acceleration could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Please see the section titled  Risks Related to our Indebtedness  of the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional detail. 
  There are no debt maturities prior to the year 2022, except, in accordance with the credit agreement, we are required to make principal payments related to the Term Loans of   $4 million   for the remainder of 2016 and   $15 million   in each year from 2017 to 2021.  Debt maturities related to the Term Loans and the Notes in 2022 and beyond will be   $3,698 million  .  In addition, following the end of each fiscal year commencing on the year ended December 31, 2016, we are also required to make additional principal repayments, depending on our leverage level as defined in the credit agreement, equivalent to up to 50% of excess cash flow based on certain leverage targets with stepdowns to 25% and 0% as actual leverage decreases to below 3.00 to 1.00 leverage target.  See Note 15 to the interim consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to our indebtedness. 
  Supplier Financing 
  In 2015, we entered into a global paying services agreement with a financial institution. Under this agreement, the financial institution acts as the paying agent for Chemours with respect to accounts payable due to our suppliers who elect to participate in the program. The agreement allows our suppliers to sell their receivables to the financial institution at the discretion of both parties on terms that are negotiated between them. Our obligations to our suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by our suppliers  decisions to sell their receivables under this program. At   September 30, 2016  , the payment instructions from Chemours were   $113 million  .  Pursuant to their agreement with the financial institution, certain suppliers may elect to get paid early at their discretion. The available capacity under this program can vary based on the number of investors participating in this program at any point in time. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  Chemours  contractual obligations at   September 30, 2016   did not significantly change from its contractual obligations previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , except that in January 2016, Chemours and DuPont entered into an agreement which set forth an advance payment of approximately   $190 million   for certain specified goods and services to be provided to DuPont over twelve to fifteen months under existing agreements with Chemours.  Approximately   $93 million   of this prepayment remains outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  See Note 4 to the interim consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Information with respect to Chemours  guarantees is included in Note 16 to the interim consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Historically, Chemours has not made significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, Chemours believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees in the event required.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Chemours  significant accounting policies are described in  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  Environmental Matters  
  Environmental Expenses 
  Environmental expenses charged to current operations include environmental operating costs and the increase in the remediation accrual, if any, during the period reported.  As a result of its operations, Chemours incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits.  Chemours also incurs costs for environmental-related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.  Management expects that such expenses in 2016 will be comparable to 2015 and, therefore, does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on Chemours  financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  
  Remediation Accrual 
  Annual expenditures in the near future are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures incurred during the past few years.  Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. There have been no significant changes to the remediation accrual at   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , Chemours, through DuPont, has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as Superfund) or similar state laws at about 174 sites around the United States, including approximately 22 sites for which Chemours does not believe it has liability based on current information.  Active remediation is under way at approximately 53 of these sites.  Approximately 66 sites have been resolved either by completing remedial actions with other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) or participating in  de minimis buyouts  with other PRPs whose waste, like Chemours , represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site.  No new notices of potential liability at any sites were received during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated balance sheet reflects an environmental liability of approximately   $281 million   relating to the above mentioned sites, as well as certain sites owned and/or operated by Chemours which, in management s opinion, is appropriate based on existing facts and circumstances.  The average time-frame over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be paid, based on past history, is estimated to be   15   to   20   years.  Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site.  These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of other PRPs.  In addition, Chemours, through DuPont, has limited available information for certain sites or is in the early stages of discussions with regulators.  For these sites in particular there may be considerable variability between the remediation activities that are currently being undertaken or planned, as reflected in the liability recorded at   September 30, 2016  , and the ultimate actions that could be required. 
  Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to approximately   $600 million   above the amount accrued at   September 30, 2016  .  Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of Chemours.

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide non-GAAP financial measures ( Adjusted EBITDA ,  Adjusted Net Income  and  Free Cash Flow ) to provide investors with a better understanding of the Company s performance when analyzing changes in our underlying business between reporting periods and to allow for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.  We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of segment profitability used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). 
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before taxes excluding the following: 
             
    interest expense, depreciation and amortization, 
                
    non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, which represent the components of net periodic pension costs (income) excluding service cost component 
                
    exchange losses (gains), 
                
    employee separation, asset-related charges and other charges, net, 
                
    asset impairments, 
                
    losses (gains) on sale of business or assets, and 
                
    other items not considered indicative of our ongoing operational performance and expected to occur infrequently. 
     Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Chemours adjusted for items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA except interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and certain provision for (benefit from) income taxes.  Free Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows (a GAAP financial measure). 
  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the Company s operating performance and underlying prospects.  This analysis should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.   In the future, we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation.  Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequently occurring items.  The non-GAAP financial measures we use may be defined differently from measures with the same or similar names used by other companies.  This analysis, as well as the other information provided in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, should be read in conjunction with the Company s interim financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report as well as the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

    The three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes   $46 million   pre-tax asset impairment of our Pascagoula Aniline facility (see Note 12) and other asset write-offs.  The nine months ended   September 30, 2016   also included   $58 million   pre-tax asset impairment in connection with the sale of the Sulfur business (see Note 6) and other asset write-offs, which were recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  The   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   includes $25 million of goodwill impairment (see Note 13) and $45 asset impairment of RMS facility (see Note 12).  All of these charges are recorded in the Chemical Solutions segment. 
      2      Includes accounting, legal and bankers transaction fees incurred related to the Company's strategic initiatives, which includes pre-sale transaction costs incurred in connection with the sales of the C D and Sulfur businesses (see Note 6). 
            3   
    Includes litigation settlements, water treatment accruals related to PFOA, and lease termination charges.

As discussed in the Outlook, we expect to deliver full year Adjusted EBITDA between $740 million and $775 million.  The following table reconciles our Adjusted EBITDA targets to pre-tax income: 

5      The amount represents the year-to-date net exchange losses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Full year actual results could differ from the current estimate,  and therefore could also change our estimated income before income taxes.  Forecasting the remeasurement impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation is not practical without unreasonable effort. 
   6      We do not expect to incur additional impairment, gain on sale of assets, transaction costs and legal and other charges.  Therefore, the amounts included are the same as the actual amounts reported in the nine months period ended September 30, 2016. 
   7      Provision for (benefit from) income taxes were estimated based upon current geographical mix of earnings.  Actual provision for (benefit from) income tax could defer from current estimate. 
   
  Item 3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
  We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because of our global operations. As a result, we have assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. We are also exposed to changes in the prices of certain commodities that we use in production. Changes in these rates and commodity prices may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  
  Chemours enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize volatility in earnings related to the foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that Chemours holds which are denominated in non-functional currencies.  These derivatives are stand-alone and have not been designated as a hedge.  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we entered into various foreign currency forward contracts for currencies such as the Euro, Chinese yuan and Swiss francs among others, and had   61   open contracts with an aggregate notional U.S. dollar equivalent of   $444 million  , the fair value of which amounted to approximately $1 million of net unrealized loss.  
  In a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at   September 30, 2016  , a 10% increase in the U.S. dollar against our outstanding hedged contracts on foreign currencies, such as the Euro and Chinese yuan, at the currency exchange rates as of   September 30, 2016   would decrease our net loss by approximately   $4 million  , while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the same hedged currencies would increase our net loss by approximately   $6 million  .  
  Chemours hedges its net investment in certain European operations. Changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain European operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Chemours did not record any ineffectiveness and recognized a loss of   $6 million   and   $9 million  , respectively, on its net investment hedges within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Chemours  risk management programs and the underlying exposure are closely correlated, such that the potential loss in value for the risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by change in the value of the underlying exposure.  See Note 17 to the interim consolidated financial statements for further information. 
  Additional Information 
  See Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for additional information on the Company s utilization of financial instruments and an analysis of the sensitivity of these instruments.  There have been no material changes in the market risks previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Item 4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures to give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  These controls and procedures also give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), together with management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level described above. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
