Note 1    Business Organization, Nature of Operations  

Energous Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated
in Delaware on October 30, 2012. The Company is developing a technology called WattUp  that consists of proprietary semiconductor
chipsets, software, hardware designs and antennas that can enable RF-based wire-free charging for electronic devices, providing
power at a distance and ultimately enabling charging with mobility under full software control. The Company s anticipated
business model is to supply silicon components with reference designs and license our WattUp technology to device and chip manufacturers,
wireless service providers and other commercial partners to make wire-free charging an affordable, ubiquitous and convenient option
for end users. The Company believes its proprietary technology can potentially be utilized in a variety of devices, including wearables,
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smartphones, tablets, e-book readers, keyboards, mice, remote controls, rechargeable lights,
cylindrical batteries and any other device with similar charging requirements that would otherwise need a battery or a connection
to a power outlet. 

The Company is developing solutions that charge electronic devices
by surrounding them with a contained three dimensional ( 3D ) radio frequency ( RF ) energy pocket ( RF
energy pocket ). The Company is engineering solutions that are expected to enable the wire-free transmission of energy from
multiple WattUp transmitters to multiple WattUp receiving devices within a range of up to fifteen (15) feet in radius or in a circular
charging envelope of up to thirty (30) feet. The Company is also developing a transmitter technology to seamlessly mesh, (much
like a network of WiFi routers) to form a wire-free charging network that will allow users to charge their devices as they walk
from room-to-room or throughout a large space. To date, the Company has developed multiple transmitter prototypes in various form
factors and power capabilities. The Company has also developed multiple receiver prototypes supporting smartphone battery cases,
toys, fitness trackers, Bluetooth headsets, as well as stand-alone receivers. 

Note 2   Liquidity and Management Plans  

During the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company recorded revenue of $1,003,973 and $1,322,155, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recorded revenue of $2,075,000 and $2,500,000, respectively. During the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $10,125,063 and $31,206,160, respectively, and during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net loss of $5,605,661 and $18,677,522, respectively. Net cash used in
operating activities was $24,439,565 and $15,460,067 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company
is currently meeting its liquidity requirements principally through the November 2015 sale of common stock pursuant to a shelf
registration, an August 2016 sale of shares to an investor through a private placement and payments received under product development
projects entered into with a tier one customer. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of $24,956,255.
On April 24, 2015, the Company filed a  shelf  registration statement on Form S-3, under which the Company may from
time to time, sell any combination of debt or equity securities up to an aggregate of $75,000,000. In November 2015, the Company
consummated an offering under the shelf registration of 3,000,005 shares of common stock through which the Company raised net proceeds
of $19,048,456. In addition, on August 9, 2016, the Company sold 1,618,123 shares of its common stock, and issued a warrant to
purchase up to 1,618,123 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $23.00 per share, to Ascend Legend Master Fund, Ltd. in
a private placement, raising net proceeds of $19,890,644. The Company expects that cash on hand as of September 30, 2016, together
with anticipated revenues, will be sufficient to fund the Company s operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Research and development of new technologies is, by its nature,
unpredictable.  Although the Company will undertake development efforts with commercially reasonable diligence, there
can be no assurance that its available resources including the net proceeds from the Company s IPO, secondary offering, shelf
registration, and strategic investor financing will be sufficient to enable it to develop and obtain regulatory approval of its
technology to the extent needed to create future revenues sufficient to sustain its operations.  The Company may choose
to pursue additional financing, depending upon the market conditions, which could include follow-on equity offerings, debt financing,
co-development agreements or other alternatives. Should the Company choose to pursue additional financing, there is no assurance
that the Company would be able to do so on terms that it would find acceptable. 

Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S.
dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US
GAAP ), and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). 

These
unaudited condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes
thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 15, 2016.  The accounting
policies used in preparing these unaudited condensed interim financial statements are consistent with those described in the December
31, 2015 audited financial statements   .   

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. 

The Company s significant estimates and assumptions include
the valuation of stock-based compensation instruments, recognition of revenue, the useful lives of long-lived assets, and income
tax expense. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Although the Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the
time the estimates and assumptions were made. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassification   

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform
to the current period presentation. These reconciliations had no effect on previously reported net loss. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments
with an original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances
that may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company maintains its
cash deposits with major financial institutions. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have
been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, collection of the revenue is reasonably assured,
and the fees are fixed or determinable. 

The Company records revenue associated with product development
projects that it enters into with certain customers.  In general, these projects are associated with complex technology development,
and as such the Company does not have certainty about its ability to achieve the program milestones. Achievement of the milestone
is dependent on our performance and the milestone typically needs to be accepted by the customer. The payment associated with achieving
the milestone is generally commensurate with the Company s effort or the value of the deliverable and is nonrefundable. The
Company records the expenses related to these projects, generally included in research and development expense, in the periods
incurred. 

The Company also receives nonrefundable payments, typically
at the beginning of a customer relationship, for which there are no milestones. The Company recognizes this revenue ratably over
the initial engineering product development period. The Company records the expenses related to these projects, generally included
in research and development expense, in the periods incurred. 

Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
continued  

Research and Development   

Research and development expenses are charged to operations
as incurred. For internally developed patents, all patent application costs are expensed as incurred as research and development
expense. Patent application costs, generally legal costs, are expensed as research and development costs until such time as the
future economic benefits of such patents become more certain. The Company incurred research and development costs of $7,944,465
and $4,758,590 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the Company incurred research and development
costs of $23,080,918 and $13,008,190 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees
in accordance with accounting guidance that requires awards to be recorded at their fair value on the date of grant and are amortized
over the vesting period of the award. The Company recognizes compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service
period of the award, which is typically the vesting term of the equity instrument issued. 

On April 10, 2015, the Company s board of directors approved
the Energous Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ), under which 600,000 shares of common stock were
reserved for purchase by the Company s employees, subject to approval by the stockholders. On May 21, 2015, the Company s
stockholders approved the ESPP. Under the plan, employees may purchase a limited number of shares of the Company s common
stock at a 15% discount from the lower of the closing market prices measured on the first and last days of each half-year period.
The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the purchase options, as measured on the grant date. 

Income Taxes   

Tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are
more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount
of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for  unrecognized tax
benefits  is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the Company s tax returns that do not meet these recognition
and measurement standards. As of September 30, 2016, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The
guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes. The Company s policy is to
record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties were recorded
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share   

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding
during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
and warrants (using the treasury stock method), the vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and performance stock
units ( PSUs ) and the enrollment of employees in the ESPP. The computation of diluted loss per share excludes potentially
dilutive securities of 5,546,269 and 4,807,729 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 5,546,269
and 4,807,729 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because their inclusion would be antidilutive.

Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share, continued   

Potentially dilutive securities outlined in the table below
have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606),
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific
guidance. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to
obtain or fulfill a contract. The amendments in the ASU must be applied using one of two retrospective methods and are effective
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. On July 9, 2015, the FASB modified ASU 2014-09 to be effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. As modified,
the FASB permits the adoption of the new revenue standard early, but not before the annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017. A public organization would apply the new revenue standard to all interim reporting periods within the year of adoption.
The Company will evaluate the effects, if any, that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements. 

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of
Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern. This standard is intended to define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial
doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S.
GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going
concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern
basis of accounting. 

The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial
reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP
lacks guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization s
ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization s
management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that
are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods
ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application
is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The adoption
of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 

Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

Recent Accounting Pronouncements, continued   

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This standard amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance
costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge.
It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material
impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Presentation
and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements    Amendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015, which clarified the SEC staff s position on presenting and measuring
debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 has been adopted concurrently with the
adoption of ASU 2015-03. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position
and results of operations. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ). The standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities
be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively,
for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will
have on its financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial
Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
( ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of
financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December
15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842).  ( ASU 2016-02 ). This standard requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments
(the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases
with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not
to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of this new standard will have on its financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) 
( ASU 2016-08 ). ASU No. 2016-08 maintains the core principles of Topic 606 on revenue recognition, but clarifies whether
an entity is a principal or an agent in a contract and the appropriate revenue recognition principles under each of these circumstances.
The amendments in ASU 2016-08 affect the guidance of ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective. The Company will evaluate the effects,
if any, that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU No. 2016-09
includes provisions to simplify certain aspects related to the accounting for share-based awards and the related financial statement
presentation. This ASU includes a requirement that the tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards be recorded in
income tax benefit or expense in the statements of earnings. This change is required to be adopted prospectively in the period
of adoption. In addition, the ASU modifies the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statements of
cash flows and these changes are required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, or in certain cases prospectively,
beginning in the period of adoption. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of this new standard will have on its financial statements.

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  ASU No. 2016-10 maintains
the core principles of Topic 606 on revenue recognition, but clarifies identification of performance obligations and licensing
implementation guidance. The amendments in ASU 2016-10 affect the guidance of ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective. The Company
will evaluate the effects, if any, that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow- Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  ASU No. 2016-12 maintains
the core principles of Topic 606 on revenue recognition, but addresses collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration,
contract modifications at transition and completed contracts at transition. The amendments in ASU 2016-12 affect the guidance of
ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective. The Company will evaluate the effects, if any, that adoption of this guidance will have
on its financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial
Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326)   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU No. 2016-13
provides financial statement reader more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments
and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The Company will evaluate the effects,

Overview  

We are developing a technology called WattUp  that consists
of proprietary semiconductor chipsets, software, hardware designs and antennas that can enable RF-based wire-free charging for
electronic devices, providing power at a distance and ultimately enabling charging with mobility under full software control. Our
anticipated business model is to supply silicon components with reference designs and license our WattUp technology to device and
chip manufacturers, wireless service providers and other commercial partners to make wire-free charging an affordable, ubiquitous
and convenient option for end users. We believe our proprietary technology can potentially be utilized in a variety of devices,
including wearables, Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices, smartphones, tablets, e-book readers, keyboards, mice, remote
controls, rechargeable lights, cylindrical batteries and any other device with similar charging requirements that would otherwise
need a battery or a connection to a power outlet. 

We believe our technology is novel in its approach, in that
we are developing a solution that charges electronic devices by surrounding them with a contained three dimensional ( 3D )
radio frequency ( RF ) energy pocket ( RF energy pocket ). We are engineering solutions that we expect
to enable the wire-free transmission of energy from multiple WattUp transmitters to multiple WattUp receiving devices within a
range of up to fifteen (15) feet in radius or in a circular charging envelope of up to thirty (30) feet. We are also developing
our transmitter technology to seamlessly mesh, (much like a network of WiFi routers) to form a wire-free charging network that
will allow users to charge their devices as they walk from room-to-room or throughout a large space. To date, we have developed
multiple transmitter prototypes in various form factors and power capabilities. We have also developed multiple receiver prototypes
supporting smartphone battery cases, toys, fitness trackers, Bluetooth headsets, as well as stand-alone receivers. 

From the beginning we recognized the need to build and design
an enterprise-class network management and control system ( NMS ) that was integral to the architecture and development
of our wire-free charging technology. Our NMS system can be scaled up to control an enterprise consisting of thousands of devices
or scaled down to work in a home or IoT environment. 

The power, distance and mobility capabilities of the WattUp
technology were validated independently by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in October 2015 and the results published in November
2015. 

Our technology solution consists principally of transmitter
and receiver application specific standard product integrated circuits ( ASSPs ) and novel antenna designs driven through
innovative algorithms and software applications. We submitted our first ASSP design for wafer fabrication in November 2013 and
have since then been developing multiple generations of transmitter and receiver ASSPs, multiple antenna designs, as well as algorithms
and software designs that we believe, in the aggregate, will optimize our technology by reducing size and cost, while increasing
performance to a level that will enable our technology to be integrated into a broad spectrum of devices. We have developed a  building
block  approach which allows us to scale our product implementations by combining multiple transmitter building blocks and/or
multiple receiver building blocks to provide the power, distance, size and cost performance necessary to meet various application
requirements. While the technology is very scalable, in order to provide the necessary strategic focus to grow the company effectively,
we have defined our market as devices that require 10 watts or less of power to charge. We will continue to invest in ASSP development
as well as in the other components of the WattUp system to improve product performance, efficiency, cost-performance and miniaturization
as required to grow the business and expand the ecosystem while also distancing us from any potential competition. 

We believe that if our development, regulatory and commercialization
efforts are successful, our transmitter and receiver technology will support a broad spectrum of charging solutions ranging from
contact-based charging or charging at distances of no more than a few centimeters ( nearfield ) to charging at distances
of up to 15 feet ( farfield ). 

In February 2015 we signed a Development and License Agreement
with one of the top consumer electronic companies in the world based on total worldwide revenues. The agreement is milestone-based
and, while there are no guarantees that the WattUp  technology will ever be integrated into our strategic partner s consumer
devices, we continue to progress the relationship as evidenced by the achievement of our first revenues in late 2015 from engineering
services resulting from the achievement of certain milestones under the agreement. We anticipate continued progress with the relationship
which we expect will result in additional engineering ervices revenue and ultimately, if fully executed, significant revenues from
royalties based on the WattUp  technology being integrated into products being shipped to the consumer. 

In January 2016 we unveiled a new Miniature WattUp Transmitter
design, as well as a small form factor receiver, both of which were developed as a direct result of our efforts to reduce cost
and size. Due to its low cost and small size, the miniature transmitter is anticipated to be bundled in-box with WattUp-enabled
receivers replacing alternative charging solutions like power adapters and charging cables. The ability to bundle and provide a
low cost, portable charging solution for receivers provides portability to the WattUp solution and is anticipated to accelerate
the ecosystem build out. 

In February 2016 we began delivering Miniature WattUp evaluation
kits to potential licensees to allow their respective engineering and product management departments to test and evaluate our technology.
We expect that the testing and evaluations currently taking place will lead to an expansion of our licensing partners and will
result in products with our nearfield technology embedded beginning to be shipped to the consumer in late 2016 or early 2017. In
May 2016 our Miniature WattUp transmitter reference design received FCC approval. 

In March 2016 we entered into a development agreement with Pegatron,
a worldwide leader in electronic and computing design and manufacturing service (DMS), in April 2016 we entered into a joint development
and licensing agreement with a specialty battery company in the hearing devices and wearables market and in May 2016 we entered
into a joint development and licensing agreement with a leading commercial and industrial supply company for industrial and commercial
applications for the full-size WattUp transmitter. 

We have implemented an aggressive intellectual property strategy
and are continuing to pursue patent protection for new innovations. As of September 30, 2016, we had in excess of 250 pending patent
applications in the US and abroad. Additionally, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) has issued our first
nine patents and notified us of the allowance of seven additional patent applications. In June 2016, Ossia Inc. filed two post
grant review petitions with the PTO challenging the patentability of one of our issued patents.  We intend to defend against
these challenges in the PTO. However, there can be no assurance that this patent will not be invalidated.  In addition to
the inventions covered by these patents and patent applications, we have identified a significant number of additional specific
inventions we believe are novel and patentable. We intend to file for patent protection for the most valuable of these, as well
as for other new inventions that we expect to develop. Our strategy is to continually monitor the costs and benefits of each patent
application and pursue those that will best protect our business and expand the core value of the Company. 

We have recruited and hired a seasoned management team with
both private and public company experience and relevant industry experience to develop and execute our operating plan. In addition,
we have identified and hired key engineering resources in the areas of ASSP development, antenna development, hardware, software
and firmware engineering as well as integration and testing which will allow us to continue to expand our technology and intellectual
property as well as meet the support requirements of our licensees. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Revenue Recognition  

We recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, collection of the revenue is reasonably assured, and
the fees are fixed or determinable. 

We record revenue associated with product development projects
that we enter into with certain customers.  In general, these projects are associated with complex technology development,
and as such we do not have certainty about our ability to achieve the program milestones. Achievement of the milestone is dependent
on our performance and the milestone typically needs to be accepted by the customer. The payment associated with achieving the
milestone is generally commensurate with our effort or the value of the deliverable and is nonrefundable. We record the expenses
related to these projects, generally included in research and development expense, in the periods incurred. 

We also receive nonrefundable payments, typically at the beginning
of a customer relationship, for which there are no milestones. We recognize this revenue ratably over the initial engineering product
development period. We record the expenses related to these projects, generally included in research and development expense, in
the periods incurred. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded revenue of $1,003,973 and $2,075,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded
revenue of $1,322,155 and $2,500,000, respectively. 

Results of Operations   

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues.   During the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded revenue of $1,003,973 and $2,075,000, respectively. 

Operating Expenses and Loss from Operations.   Operating
expenses are made up of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Loss from operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $10,128,021 and $5,608,317, respectively. 

Research and Development Costs.  Research and development
costs, which include costs for developing our technology, were $7,944,465 and $4,758,590, respectively, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in research and development costs of $3,185,875 is primarily due to a $1,137,953 increase
in compensation, including a $378,041 increase in stock-based compensation, an $868,558 increase in chip development costs tied
to our multi-chip development program, a $313,454 increase in engineering consulting costs, a $565,778 increase in patent filing
and legal costs tied to our portfolio of over 250 domestic and international filings and a $190,376 increase in design tools software
spending. 

Sales and Marketing Costs.  Sales and marketing costs
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $736,751 and $767,762, respectively. The decrease in sales and marketing
costs of $31,011 is primarily due to a decrease of $96,436 in stock-based compensation which is primarily due to the resignation
of the Chief Commercial Officer during 2015 and a $35,635 decrease in consulting costs which is a result of employees now performing
certain marketing duties previously performed by consultants, partially offset by minor increases in recruiting, travel and tradeshow
expenses. 

General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative
expenses include costs for general and corporate functions, including facility fees, travel, telecommunications, insurance, professional
fees, consulting fees and other overhead. General and administrative costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $2,450,778 and $2,156,965, respectively. The increase in general administrative costs of $293,813 is primarily due to a $178,570
increase in compensation, including stock-based compensation of $71,421, attributable in part to increased headcount within the
department, a $132,835 increase in legal and accounting expenses and a $127,247 increase in telecommunications costs from servicing
a larger staff and increased video conferencing costs, partially offset by a $109,371 decrease in consulting costs which is a result
of employees now performing duties previously performed by consultants. 

Interest Income, Net.  Interest income for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $2,958 as compared to interest income of $2,656 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Loss.  As a result of the above, net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,125,063 as compared to $5,605,661 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues.   During the nine months ended September,
2016 and 2015, we recorded revenue of $1,322,155 and $2,500,000, respectively. 

Operating Expenses and Loss from Operations.   Operating
expenses are made up of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Loss from operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $31,215,601 and $18,689,887, respectively. 

Research and Development Costs.  Research and development
costs, which include costs for developing our technology, were $23,080,918 and $13,008,190, respectively, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in research and development costs of $10,072,728 is primarily due to a $2,956,158 increase
in compensation from increased engineering headcount within the department, including $511,823 in stock-based compensation, a $3,327,528
increase in chip design costs tied to our multi-chip development effort, a $1,357,833 increase in patent filing and legal costs
tied to our portfolio of over 250 domestic and international filings, a $739,439 increase in software spending, primarily from
our hosted design solution package and a $557,140 increase in consulting fees, primarily from additional assistance in quality
assurance engineering. 

Sales and Marketing Costs.  Sales and marketing costs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,189,995 and $2,518,114, respectively. The decrease in sales and marketing
costs of $328,119 is primarily due to a decrease of $321,140 in compensation, including a decrease in stock-based compensation
of $302,535, primarily due to the resignation of the Chief Commercial Officer in October 2015. 

General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative
expenses include costs for general and corporate functions, including facility fees, travel, telecommunications, insurance, professional
fees, consulting fees and other overhead. General and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $7,266,843 and $5,663,583, respectively. The increase in general administrative costs of $1,603,260 is primarily due to a
$1,190,897 increase in compensation, including an increase in stock-based compensation of $890,185, attributable in part to increased
headcount within the department, including the CFO position now being filled, and recognition of a full nine months of the CEOs
RSU agreement during 2016, a $282,591 increase in telecommunications and supplies expense in order to accommodate a larger corporate
staff and a $158,943 increase in legal and accounting fees. 

Interest Income, Net.  Interest income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $9,441 as compared to interest income of $12,365 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
change in interest income is primarily due to a lower average cash balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net Loss.  As a result of the above, net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $31,206,160 as compared to $18,677,522 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded revenue of $1,003,973 and $2,075,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded
revenue of $1,322,155 and $2,500,000, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $10,125,063 and $5,605,661 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $31,206,160 and $18,677,522 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $24,439,565 and $15,460,067 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company is currently meeting its liquidity requirements principally through proceeds
from the November 2015 sale of common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement, proceeds from an investor through a private
sale of common stock and payments received under product development projects entered into with a customer. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$24,956,255. 

We believe our current cash on hand, together with anticipated
payments received under current and future product development projects entered into with customers, will be sufficient to fund
our operations into the fourth quarter of 2017. However, depending on how soon we are able to achieve meaningful commercial revenues,
we may require additional financing to fully implement our business plan, the ultimate goal of which is to license our technology
to device manufacturers, wireless service providers and other commercial partners to make wire-free charging an affordable, ubiquitous
and convenient option for end users. Potential financing sources could include follow-on equity offerings, debt financing, co-development
agreements or other alternatives. Depending upon market conditions, we may choose to pursue additional financing to, among other
reasons, accelerate our product development efforts, regulatory activities and business development and support functions with
a view to capitalizing on the market opportunity we see for our wire-free charging technology. On April 24, 2015, we filed a  shelf 
registration statement on Form S-3, which became effective on April 30, 2015. The  shelf  registration statement allows
the Company from time to time to sell any combination of debt or equity securities described in the registration statement up to
aggregate proceeds of $75,000,000. In November 2015, the Company consummated an offering under the shelf registration of 3,000,005
shares of common stock through which the Company raised net proceeds of $19,048,456. In August 2016, the Company sold shares in
a private placement in which the Company raised net proceeds of $19,890,644. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows
used in operating activities were $24,439,565, consisting of a net loss of $31,206,160, less non-cash expenses aggregating $6,095,109
(representing principally stock-based compensation of $5,405,908 and depreciation expense of $628,613), a $625,000 increase in
accounts receivable, a $484,284 increase in prepaid and other current assets, partially offset by a $948,700 increase in accounts
payable from the timing of invoice payments, a $717,002 increase in accrued expenses and a $112,245 increase in deferred revenue.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash flows used in operating activities were $15,460,067, consisting of a net
loss of $18,677,522, less non-cash expenses aggregating $4,984,540 (representing principally stock-based compensation of $4,306,435
and depreciation expense of $617,517), a $2,000,000 increase in accounts receivable and a $4,338 increase in prepaid expenses and
other current assets, partially offset by an increase of $58,591 in accounts payable and an increase of $194,945 in accrued expenses. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash
flows used in investing activities were $858,445 and $732,634, respectively. The cash used in investing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of the purchase of laboratory equipment and building fixtures. The increase for the nine

software to support newly hired employees. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows
provided by financing activities were $20,381,701, which consisted of $19,890,660 in net proceeds from the sale of stock in a private
placement with an investor, $533,005 in proceeds from contributions to the employee stock purchase program ( ESPP )
and $270,716 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by $266,217 in shares withheld to cover payroll taxes on vested
RSUs and $46,463 in shares withheld to cover payroll taxes on vested PSUs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash

the exercise of stock options and disgorgement of profit from the sale of stock. 

Research and development of new technologies is, by its nature,
unpredictable. Although we will undertake development efforts with commercially reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance
that our available resources including the net proceeds from our public offerings will be sufficient to enable us to develop our
technology to the extent needed to create future revenues to sustain our operations. 

We cannot assure that our technology will
be adopted, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations, or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore,
since we have no committed source of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital as and when we
need it to continue our operations. 

Off Balance Sheet Transactions   

As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet
transactions. 

Material Changes in Specified Contractual Obligations   

A table of our specified contractual obligations was provided
in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  of our most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in the specified contractual obligations
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure About Market Risk 

There has been no material change in our exposure to market
risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Please refer to  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  contained in Part II, Item 7A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of our exposure
to market risk. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and the board of directors. 

Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016, our principal
executive and principal financial and accounting officers have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported, within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that information required
to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information
set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under  Risk Factors  in our annual report
on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2016. These factors could materially adversely affect
