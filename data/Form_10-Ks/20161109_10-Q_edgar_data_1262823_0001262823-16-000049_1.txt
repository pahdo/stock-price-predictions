NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
  The body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as "U.S. GAAP." For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measures. In this report, we disclose so-called non-GAAP financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this Form 10-Q are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of earnings and cash flow. 
  EBITDA is included in this Form 10-Q because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. In addition, we utilize EBITDA in evaluating acquisition targets. Management also believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and EBITDA is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. EBITDA is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of earnings or of cash flow and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. In addition, it should be noted that companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes.

1. Basis of Financial Statements 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements were prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim periods. Accordingly, certain information and footnotes required for complete financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") have not been included. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the December 31,   2015   financial statements and notes thereto of Westlake Chemical Corporation (the "Company") included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015   (the "  2015   Form 10-K"), filed with the SEC on   February 24, 2016  . These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the accounting principles and practices as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015  . 
  In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , its results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and the changes in its cash position for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Results of operations and changes in cash position for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that will be realized for the fiscal year ending December 31,   2016   or any other interim period. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations to conform to current presentation. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU No. 2014-09) 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update on a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede the existing revenue recognition guidance. The new accounting guidance creates a framework by which an entity will allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. Under the new standard, entities will be required to use judgment and make estimates, including identifying performance obligations in a contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and determining when an entity satisfies its performance obligations. The standard allows for either "full retrospective" adoption, meaning that the standard is applied to all of the periods presented with a cumulative catch-up as of the earliest period presented, or "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative catch-up as of the current period. In 2016, the FASB issued various additional authoritative guidance for the new revenue recognition standard. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU No. 2016-01) 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making certain changes principally to the current guidance for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Among other things, the guidance (1) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) provide entities with a policy election to record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, and subsequent adjustments for observable price changes (changes in the basis of these equity investments to be reported in net income); (3) requires an entity that has elected the fair value option for financial liabilities to recognize changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk separately in other comprehensive income; (4) clarified current guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities; and (5) requires specific disclosure pertaining to financial assets and financial liabilities in the financial statements. The accounting standard will be effective for

  (in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Leases (ASU No. 2016-02) 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on a new lease standard that will supersede the existing lease guidance. The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities related to long-term leases that are classified as operating leases under current guidance on its balance sheet. An asset would be recognized related to the right to use the underlying asset and a liability would be recognized related to the obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. The standard also requires expanded disclosures related to leases. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASU No. 2016-07) 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update providing new guidance for the accounting for equity method investments. The new guidance eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. In addition, the guidance requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Stock Compensation (ASU No. 2016-09) 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classifications of awards as either equity or liabilities and certain related classifications on the statement of cash flows. In addition, the new guidance permits entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Credit Losses (ASU No. 2016-13) 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update providing new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The standard also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Cash Flows (ASU No. 2016-16) 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update providing new guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments including debt extinguishment costs, debt prepayment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees in the statement of cash flows. This update is required to be applied using the retrospective transition method to each period presented unless it is impracticable to be applied retrospectively. In such situation, this guidance is to be applied prospectively. The accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods

beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (ASU No. 2015-02) 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making certain changes to the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new standard changes the consideration of substantive rights, related party interests and fees paid to the decision maker when applying the variable interest entity consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The accounting standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU No. 2015-03) 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires all costs incurred to issue debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The accounting standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2016. As a result, Other assets, net Deferred charges and other assets, net and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 have been adjusted to   $176,625   and   $758,148  , respectively, from the originally reported   $173,384   and   $764,115  , respectively, to reflect the retrospective application of the new accounting guidance. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows. 
  Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal use software (ASU No. 2015-05) 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide clarification on accounting for cloud computing arrangements which include a software license. The accounting standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this accounting standard, to be applied prospectively, effective January 1, 2016. Consistent with the prospective application of this accounting standard, prior period comparative information was not adjusted. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (ASU No. 2015-16) 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The guidance requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The new guidance further requires specific disclosure pertaining to the measurement period adjustments. The accounting standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU No. 2015-17) 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The accounting standard is required to be adopted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this accounting standard, to be applied prospectively, effective January 1, 2016. Consistent with the prospective application of this accounting standard, prior period comparative information was not adjusted. The early adoption of this accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows.

2. Acquisition 
  On August 31, 2016, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of, and acquired all the remaining equity interest in, Axiall Corporation ("Axiall"), a Delaware corporation. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held   3.1 million   shares in Axiall. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 10, 2016, by and among Westlake, Axiall and Lagoon Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westlake ("Merger Sub"), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall for   $33.00   per share in cash. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into Axiall (the "Merger"), and Axiall survived the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The combined company is the third-largest global chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest global polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") producer. The Company's management believes that this strategic acquisition will enhance its strategy of integration and will further strengthen its role in the North American markets. 
  Axiall produces a highly integrated chain of chlor-alkali and derivative products, including chlorine, caustic soda, vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM"), vinyl resins, ethylene dichloride (OR 1, 2 dichloroethane), chlorinated solvents, calcium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid, and compound products. Axiall also manufactures and sells building products, including interior and exterior trim and mouldings products, deck products, siding, pipe and pipe fittings. Substantially all of the vinyl resin used to manufacture Axiall's building products is sourced internally. 
  Total consideration transferred for the Axiall Merger was   $2,526,080  . The Merger is being accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Company's Vinyls segment. 
  The acquired business contributed net sales and net loss of   $257,407   and (  $47,164  ), respectively, to the Company for the period from August 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016. The net loss for the period from August 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016 included integration-related costs and the negative impact of selling higher cost Axiall inventory recorded at fair value. The following unaudited consolidated pro forma information presents consolidated information as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2015: 

_____________ 
           (1) 
    The 2016 pro forma net income amounts include Axiall's historical charges recorded during the eight-month period prior to the closing of the Merger for (1) divestitures; (2) restructuring; and (3) legal and settlement claims, net, of   $26,666  ,   $22,881   and   $23,376  , respectively. These amounts have not been eliminated for pro forma purposes because they do not relate to nonrecurring transaction specific costs related to the Merger.  
     The pro forma amounts above have been calculated after applying the Company's accounting policies and adjusting the Axiall results to reflect (1) the increase to depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2015; (2) the elimination of net sales and cost of sales between the Company and Axiall; (3) additional pension service costs; (4) amortization of debt premium and accretion of asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities as part of the Company's adjustments to fair value; (5) incremental interest expense that would have been incurred assuming the financing arrangements entered by the Company and repayment of a portion of Axiall's outstanding debt had occurred on January 1, 2015; (6) the elimination of transaction-related costs; (7) the elimination of Axiall's goodwill impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and (8) an adjustment to tax-effect the aforementioned pro forma adjustments using an estimated aggregate statutory

  (in thousands of dollars, except share amounts and per share data) 

income tax rate of the jurisdictions to which the above adjustments relate. The pro forma amounts do not include any potential synergies, cost savings or other expected benefits of the Merger, are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of results that would have been achieved if the Merger had occurred as of January 1, 2015 or of future operating performance. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $90,550   of transaction and integration-related costs. This included acquisition-related costs of   $43,895   for advisory, consulting and professional fees and other expenses. Transaction and integration-related costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   also included   $46,655   related to settlement of Axiall share-based awards, retention agreement costs and severance benefits provided to former Axiall executives in connection with the Merger. 
  The following table summarizes the consideration transferred and the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the consideration transferred is based on management's estimates, judgments and assumptions. When determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of the acquiree, management made significant estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are subject to change upon final valuation and should be treated as preliminary values. Management estimated that consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Therefore, goodwill of   $863,144   was recorded. The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to synergies related to the Company's vinyls integration strategy that are expected to arise from the Merger. All of the goodwill is assigned to the Company's Vinyls segment. As a portion of the goodwill arising from the Merger is attributable to foreign operations, there will be a continuing foreign currency impact to goodwill on the financial statements. 

_____________ 
           (1) 
    Transactions costs incurred by the seller include legal and advisory costs incurred for the benefit of Axiall's former shareholders and board of directors to evaluate the Company's initial Merger proposals, explore strategic alternatives and negotiate the purchase price. 
              (2) 
    The fair value of share-based awards attributable to pre-combination service includes the ratio of the pre-combination service performed to the original service period of the Axiall restricted share units and options, including related dividend equivalent rights. 
              (3) 
    Prior to the Merger, the Company owned   3.1 million   shares in Axiall. The investment in Axiall was carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company recognized a   $49,080   gain for the investment in other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations upon gaining control. 
     The final allocation of purchase consideration, based on final valuations, could include changes in the estimated fair value of (1) inventories; (2) property, plant and equipment; (3) equity investments; (4) customer relationships, trade names, developed technologies and other intangibles; (5) deferred income taxes; (6) all contingencies; (7) asset retirement obligations; and (8) noncontrolling interests. The assumed contingencies relate to environmental liabilities, legal liabilities, asset retirement obligations and warranty reserves that are provisionally recorded based on estimated fair value.

6. Property, Plant and Equipment 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had property, plant and equipment, net totaling   $6,450,947  . The Company assesses these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Other factors considered by the Company when determining if an impairment assessment is necessary include, but are not limited to, significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the U.S. and world economies and uncertainties associated with governmental actions. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. 
  Depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment of   $75,143   and   $52,208   is primarily included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.

9. Term Loan 
  On August 10, 2016, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, Westlake International Holdings II C.V., a limited partnership organized under the laws of the Netherlands (the "CV Borrower"), entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent and lender, providing the CV Borrower with a   $150,000   term loan facility. The term loan facility matures on March 31, 2017. The loans thereunder bear interest at a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus   2.0%   per annum, payable in arrears on the last day of each three-month period following the date of funding and at maturity. The CV Borrower may elect to convert the interest rate to a base rate with a   1.0%   spread. The interest rate on the outstanding term loan was   2.82%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The facility contains customary covenants and events of default that impose certain operating and financial restrictions on the CV Borrower and certain of its subsidiaries. These restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens and the ability to engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
  Pursuant to the credit agreement, all of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company are to remain owned, directly or indirectly, by the CV Borrower and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westlake International II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("WII LLC"). The CV Borrower is also required, together with its subsidiaries, to maintain at all times unencumbered cash and cash equivalents in a U.S. dollar equivalent of not less than   $150,000  , which amount shall be increased by   5%   to the extent maintained in non-U.S. currencies. In connection therewith, an amount of cash and cash equivalents for the period (a) from the closing date until the date   30   days thereafter, not less than   $50,000  , and (b) thereafter, not less than   $75,000  , shall be maintained by the CV Borrower and its subsidiaries in accounts at Bank of America, N.A., in accordance with existing cash management agreements. 
  Obligations under the term loan facility are secured by a pledge of   65%   of the membership interests of WII LLC as well as rights under the partnership agreement of Westlake International Holdings C.V., a limited partnership organized under the laws of the Netherlands, held by WII LLC and the CV Borrower. 
   
  10. Long-Term Debt 
  The Company adopted an accounting standards update to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs effective January 1, 2016. The standard requires, on a retrospective basis, all costs incurred to issue debt, excluding line-of-credit arrangements, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. As a result, Other assets, net Deferred charges and other assets, net and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 have been adjusted to   $176,625   and   $758,148  , respectively, from the originally reported   $173,384   and   $764,115  , respectively, to reflect the retrospective application of the new accounting guidance.

Under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have committed to provide an unsecured   five  -year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $1,000,000  . The Credit Agreement replaced the Company's existing   $400,000   senior secured third amended and restated credit facility, dated as of July 17, 2014, by and among the Company, the financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers. The Credit Agreement includes a   $150,000   sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary   $50,000   commitment for swing line loans to be provided on a same-day basis. The Company may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least   $25,000  , up to a maximum of   $500,000  , subject to certain conditions and if certain Lenders agree to commit to such an increase.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $325,000   of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (a) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from   1.0%   to

1.75%   that will vary depending on the credit rating of the Company or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a spread ranging from   0.0%   to   0.75%   that will vary depending on the credit rating of the Company. The Credit Agreement also requires an undrawn commitment fee ranging from   0.10%   to   0.25%   that will vary depending on the credit rating of the Company. The interest rate on the outstanding revolving credit facility was   2.05%   at   September 30, 2016  . The Credit Agreement matures on August 23, 2021. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $76,581   and borrowing availability of   $598,419   under the Credit Agreement. 
  The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by current and future material domestic subsidiaries of the Company, subject to customary exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default and if and for so long as an event of default has occurred and is continuing, any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the Lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the Lenders. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. 
  3.60% Senior Notes due 2026 and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2046 
  On August 10, 2016, the Company completed its private offering of   $750,000   aggregate principal amount of   3.60%   senior notes due 2026 (the "  3.60% 2026 Senior Notes  ") and   $700,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.0%   senior notes due 2046 (the "  5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  "). The   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   are the Company's senior obligations and are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   and guarantees are unsecured and rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior unsecured obligations and each guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured obligations. The Company has entered into a registration rights agreement in which it has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement or, under specified circumstances, a shelf registration statement, with the SEC with respect to the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  . The net proceeds from the offering were used to finance the Merger and to repay amounts under the term loan facility dated February 27, 2015 entered into by Axiall Holdco, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Axiall), as the borrower, with the financial institutions party thereto. The indenture governing the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict the Company's and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company's or their assets. 
  Exchange Offers 
  On September 7, 2016, the Company completed offers to exchange (the "Axiall Exchange Offers") any and all of the   $688,000   aggregate principal amount of the outstanding   4.625%   senior notes due 2021 (the "  4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes  ") issued by Eagle Spinco Inc. ("Eagle Spinco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Axiall, and the   $450,000   aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 4.875% senior notes due 2023 (the "  4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes  " and, together with the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes  , the "Subsidiary Notes") issued by Axiall for new senior notes issued by the Company having the same maturity and interest rates as the Subsidiary Notes. The   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes   were assumed at fair value, which resulted in a premium on the Subsidiary Notes of   $33,540   and   $15,750  , respectively. In the Axiall Exchange Offers,   $624,793   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and   $433,793   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes   were exchanged, respectively, for   $624,793   aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 (the "  4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes  ") and   $433,793   aggregate principal amount of   4.875%   senior notes due 2023 (the "  4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  ") issued by the Company, leaving outstanding   $63,207   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and   $16,207   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes  . The Subsidiary Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of Axiall and Eagle Spinco, respectively. The   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   are the Company's senior obligations and are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   and guarantees are unsecured and rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior unsecured obligations and each guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured obligations. The Company has entered into a registration rights agreement in which it has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement or, under specified circumstances, a shelf registration statement, with the SEC with respect to the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  . The indenture governing the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict the Company's and certain of its subsidiaries' ability

  Bridge Loan Agreement 
  In June 2016, in connection with the Axiall acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter with various lenders pursuant to which such lenders agreed to provide for a senior unsecured bridge loan facility of up to   $1,765,000   in the aggregate. Also in June 2016, the Company paid structuring and other fees of approximately   $9,700   in connection with the senior unsecured bridge loan facility. On August 26, 2016, the Company terminated the senior unsecured bridge loan facility and expensed the remaining   $8,900   of structuring and other fees paid for the senior unsecured bridge loan facility. This amount is included in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  11. Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits  
  In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed certain U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans covering Axiall employees. The Axiall pension plans are closed to new participants and provide benefits to certain employees and retirees. The other post-retirement benefit plans are unfunded and provide medical and life insurance benefits for certain employees and their dependents. See Note 2 for the fair value of pension and other post-retirement obligations assumed in the Merger. 
  Defined Benefit Plans 
  Components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company's pension plans are as follows:

  13. Stock-Based Compensation 
  Under the Westlake Chemical Corporation 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2013 Plan"), all employees and non-employee directors of the Company, as well as certain individuals who have agreed to become the Company's employees, are eligible for awards. Shares of common stock may be issued as authorized in the 2013 Plan. At the discretion of the administrator of the 2013 Plan, employees and non-employee directors may be granted awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock units or cash awards (any of which may be a performance award). Total stock-based compensation expense related to the 2013 Plan was   $1,502   and   $2,639   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,     respectively, and   $6,588   and   $7,544   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,     respectively. 
  Under the Merger Agreement, all outstanding Axiall restricted stock units were assumed by the Company and converted into restricted stock units in respect of the Company's common stock, with the same terms and conditions except that upon

settlement the award holders will receive the greater of (1) the value of   $33.00   per Axiall restricted stock unit that was converted into a restricted stock unit in respect of the Company's common stock and (2) the value of the Company's common stock. The awards are classified as liability awards for financial accounting purposes and are re-measured at each reporting date until they vest. The portion of the replacement award that is attributable to pre-combination service by the employee is included in the measure of consideration transferred to acquire Axiall. The remaining fair value of the replacement awards will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remainder of the vesting period. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized related to the Merger Agreement for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $34,915  , of which   $32,644   is included in transaction and integration-related costs in the consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  14. Derivative Instruments 
  Commodity Risk Management 
  The Company uses derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on raw materials and products as a substantial portion of its raw materials and products are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Business strategies to protect against such instability include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable. The Company does not use derivative instruments to engage in speculative activities. 
  Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments were included in gross profit in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  The exposure on commodity derivatives used for price risk management includes the risk that the counterparty will not pay if the market declines below the established fixed price. In such case, the Company would lose the benefit of the derivative differential on the volume of the commodities covered. In any event, the Company would continue to receive the market price on the actual volume hedged. The Company also bears the risk that it could lose the benefit of market improvements over the fixed derivative price for the term and volume of the derivative instruments (as such improvements would accrue to the benefit of the counterparty). 
  The fair values of derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

See Note 15 for the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments. 
  Disclosure about Offsetting Asset and Liability Derivatives 
  Certain of the Company's derivative instruments are executed under an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Master Agreement, which permits the Company and a counterparty to aggregate the amounts owed by each party under multiple transactions and replace them with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. The following tables present the Company's derivative assets and derivative liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative assets and derivative liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.

15. Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Under the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, inputs used to measure fair value are classified in one of three levels: 
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
  The following tables summarize, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Level 2 measurements for the Company's commodity contracts are derived using forward curves supplied by industry-recognized and unrelated third-party services. The Level 2 measurements for the Company's available-for-sale securities are derived using market-based pricing provided by unrelated third-party services. 
  There were no transfers in or out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

In addition to the financial assets and liabilities above, the Company has other financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts and notes payable and current and long-term debt, all of which are recorded at carrying value. The amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts and notes payable and current term loan approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying and fair values of the Company's long-term debt are summarized in the table below. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt instruments is determined using a market approach, based upon quotes from financial reporting services. Because the Company's long-term debt instruments may not be actively traded, the inputs used to measure the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. 

The carrying values of the Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of the accounting standards update on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs discussed in Note 10. 
   
  16. Income Taxes 
  The Company elected to early adopt an accounting standards update requiring the noncurrent classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, effective January 1, 2016. As a result, the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities have been classified, by jurisdiction, as a net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Consistent with the prospective application of this accounting standard, prior period comparative information was not adjusted. 
  The effective income tax rate was   (10.3)%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The effective tax rate for the   2016   period was   below   the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the Merger. The effective income tax rate was   24.2%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The effective income tax rate for the   2015   period was   below   the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the foreign earnings rate differential, the increased benefit in certain prior years' deductions due to a change in the calculation methodology of the domestic manufacturing deduction and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed, partially offset by state income taxes.

The effective income tax rate was   29.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The effective tax rate for the   2016   period was   below   the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the Merger. The effective income tax rate was   30.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The effective income tax rate for the   2015   period was   below   the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the bargain purchase of a controlling interest in Suzhou Huasu Plastics Co., Ltd., the increased benefit in certain prior years' deductions due to a change in the calculation methodology of the domestic manufacturing deduction and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes. 
  There are total gross unrecognized tax benefits of   $8,818   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company recognizes penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The majority of the total unrecognized tax benefits relate to historical balances reported by Axiall prior to the Merger. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company accrued interest and penalties in the amount of   $206   related to uncertain tax positions. 
  Reconciliations of the unrecognized tax benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are set forth in the table below: 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities before the year 2010. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company is not permanently reinvested with respect to the outside basis difference for all of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company is asserting under ASC 740-30 that the unremitted earnings of some of its foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. For these foreign subsidiaries, the earnings and profits (E P) is estimated to be   $204,154   at December 31, 2016. If no assertion were made to permanently reinvest any of these unremitted foreign earnings, U.S. income tax expense of approximately   $32,272   relating to U.S. tax would be recorded. Such expense takes into account utilization of foreign tax credits. The Company is not asserting under ASC 740-30 for certain other foreign subsidiaries. As such, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability (and related tax expense) of   $1,837  . Of this amount,   $1,169   has been recorded to recognize the foreign taxes that would result if earnings in lower-tier foreign subsidiaries would be distributed up the foreign ownership chain to a subsidiary where an assertion is made. In addition,   $668   has been recorded to recognize the U.S. tax impact of the unremitted foreign earnings of the Company's Taiwanese subsidiary based on four months of activity from acquisition date to the year ended December 31, 2016. The Taiwanese subsidiary is expected to make annual distributions to the Company.

17. Earnings per Share 
  The Company has unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding that are considered participating securities and, therefore, computes basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method. Basic earnings per share for the periods are based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share include the effect of certain stock options. 

The following table reconciles the denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share computations shown in the consolidated statements of operations: 

Excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share are options to purchase   620,010   and   315,285   shares of common stock for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   577,254   and   295,825   shares of common stock for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. These options were outstanding during the periods reported but were excluded because the effect of including them would have been antidilutive. 
   
  18. Supplemental Information 
  Accrued Liabilities 
  Accrued liabilities were   $552,581   and   $287,313   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Accrued rebates, which is a component of accrued liabilities, was   $73,798   and   $46,460   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. No other component of accrued liabilities was more than five percent of total current liabilities.

19. Insurance Recovery 
  During the second and third quarters of 2015, the Company's production rates and operating costs at its Knapsack, Germany and Cologne, Germany facilities were negatively impacted due to an interruption of feedstock supply as a result of a fire at a third-party supplier's ethylene production facility. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company received a final insurance recovery of approximately   $2,670   related to business interruption costs. The insurance recovery is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company had received and recognized approximately   $7,809   as a partial insurance recovery during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  20. Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is involved in a number of legal and regulatory matters, principally environmental in nature, that are incidental to the normal conduct of its business, including lawsuits, investigations and claims. The outcome of these matters are inherently unpredictable. The Company believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all known legal and regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements; however, specific outcomes with respect to such matters may be material to the Company's consolidated statements of operations in any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. The Company's assessment of the potential impact of environmental matters, in particular, is subject to uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation of such environmental matters, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. In addition, the impact of evolving claims and programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site reuse initiatives and state remediation programs creates further uncertainty of the ultimate resolution of these matters. The Company anticipates that the resolution of many legal and regulatory matters, and in particular environmental matters, will occur over an extended period of time. 
  Environmental.   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling approximately   $60,693   (primarily as a result of the Axiall acquisition) and   $1,095  , respectively, most of which was classified as noncurrent liabilities. The Company's assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments. 
  From time to time the Company receives notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. Item 103 of the SEC's Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, unless the Company reasonably believes such sanctions would not exceed $100. 
             
    In May 2013, an amendment to an existing consent order agreed to by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and a predecessor of Axiall required that it, among other things, pay a penalty in the amount of   $449   and continue certain corrective action associated with discharges of hexachlorocyclohexane

(commonly referred to as BHC) from the Natrium, West Virginia facility's effluent discharge outfalls. The penalty was paid and corrective actions required under the amendment to the consent order are on-going. 
             
    In May 2013 and September 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") conducted inspections at the Company's Plaquemine, Louisiana facility pursuant to requirements of the federal Clean Air Act Section 112(r) Risk Management Program and Title V. As a result of the inspections, the EPA identified areas of concern and the Company has subsequently engaged in negotiations, which are anticipated to result in sanctions of   $167  .  
                
    The LDEQ has issued notices of violations ("NOVs") regarding the Company's olefins facilities in Lake Charles, Louisiana for various air and water compliance issues. The Company is working with the LDEQ to settle these claims, and a global settlement of all claims is being discussed. The Company has reached a verbal agreement with the LDEQ to settle certain of the NOVs in   two   separate settlements for a combined   $192   in civil penalties.  
                
    During September 2010, the Company's vinyls facilities in north Lake Charles and Plaquemine each received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty, alleging violations of various requirements of those facilities' air permits, based largely on self-reported permit deviations related to record-keeping violations. The Company has been negotiating a possible global settlement of these and several other matters with the LDEQ. The Company believes the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of   $100  .  
                
    In April 2015, Axiall received a communication from the EPA related to, among other things, the EPA's investigation of the 2012 and 2013 fires that occurred at its VCM plant in Lake Charles. In late 2015, Axiall settled this matter with the EPA, with such settlement including on-going supplemental environmental projects and a payment of   $900  . 
                
    For several years, the EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. On April 21, 2014, the Company received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request from the EPA which sought information regarding flares at the Calvert City, Kentucky and certain Lake Charles facilities. The EPA has informed the Company that the information provided leads the EPA to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. The EPA has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate the Company to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. The Company believes the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of   $100  . 
     The Company does not believe that resolutions of any or all of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  21. Segment Information 
  The Company operates in   two   principal operating segments: Olefins and Vinyls. These segments are strategic business units that offer a variety of different products. The Company manages each segment separately as each business requires different technology and marketing strategies.

  23. Guarantor Disclosures 
  The Company's payment obligations under the   3.60%   senior notes due   2022   are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of its current and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of the Company or of another guarantor of the   3.60%   senior notes due   2022   in excess of   $5,000   (the "Guarantor Subsidiaries"). Each Guarantor Subsidiary is   100%   owned by Westlake Chemical Corporation (the "  100%   Owned Guarantor Subsidiaries"). These guarantees are the joint and several obligations of the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The following unaudited condensed consolidating financial information presents the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Westlake Chemical Corporation, the   100%   owned Guarantor Subsidiaries, and the remaining subsidiaries that do not guarantee the   3.60%   senior notes due   2022   (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"), together with consolidating eliminations necessary to present the Company's results on a consolidated basis. 
  In August 2016, certain of the Company's subsidiary guarantors were released from their guarantees of the Company's   3.60%   senior notes due   2022   in connection with the replacement of the Company's revolving credit facility. Westlake Chemical OpCo LP, which was previously separately presented as a less than 100% owned guarantor, and certain of the Company's other 100% owned subsidiaries that were previously presented as guarantors, are now reflected as Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries in the condensed consolidating guarantor financial information. Prior periods were retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current presentation of Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Item 2. 
    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with information contained in the accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Westlake Chemical Corporation and the notes thereto and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Westlake Chemical Corporation included in Westlake Chemical Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015   (the "  2015   Form 10-K"). The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please read "Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of limitations inherent in such statements. 
  We are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. Our two principal operating segments are Olefins and Vinyls. We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain with significant downstream integration into polyethylene and styrene monomer. We are also an integrated global producer of vinyls with substantial downstream integration into polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") building products. 
  Since 2009 and continuing through the third quarter of 2016, a cost advantage for ethane-based ethylene producers over naphtha-based ethylene producers has allowed a strong export market for polyethylene, ethylene derivatives and higher margins for North American chemical producers, including Westlake. Continued strong global demand for polyethylene has resulted in improved operating margins and cash flow for our Olefins segment in recent years. However, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by North American ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices, beginning in the third quarter of 2014 and continuing through the third quarter of 2016. Falling crude oil prices have resulted in reduced prices and margins and may continue to do so. However, our European operations rely primarily on feedstock derived from naphtha-based ethylene crackers and may benefit from lower crude oil prices. Looking forward, new olefins capacity additions in Asia, the Middle East and North America, a number of which have been announced in recent years, may lead to periods of over-supply and lower profitability. 
  Continued slow recovery in the U.S. construction markets and budgetary constraints in municipal spending have contributed to lower North American demand for our vinyls products, which may continue to negatively impact our Vinyls segment operating rates and margins. Likewise, European industry production capacities currently exceed demand in the region, largely due to the weak economic environment in Europe. However, since late 2010, the PVC industry in North America has experienced an increase in PVC resin export demand, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in North America. As a consequence, North American PVC resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010, largely due to higher PVC resin export shipments. In addition, the completion of our world-scale Geismar, Louisiana chlor-alkali plant and the ethane feedstock conversion and ethylene expansion project at Westlake Chemical OpCo LP's ("OpCo") Calvert City, Kentucky ethylene plant in 2013 and 2014, respectively, as well as the July 2014 acquisition of Vinnolit Holdings GmbH and its subsidiary companies ("Vinnolit"), an integrated global leader in specialty PVC resins, have contributed to improved operating margins and cash flow for our Vinyls segment. 
  The economic environment in the United States and globally appears to be slowly improving. However, depending on the performance of the global economy in the remainder of 2016 and beyond, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the European economy has been slower to recover than the U.S. economy. 
  Recent Developments 
  On August 31, 2016, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Axiall Corporation ("Axiall") for $33.00 per share in an all-cash transaction (the "Merger"), pursuant to the terms of the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 10, 2016, by and among Westlake, Axiall and Lagoon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westlake. The combined company is the third-largest global chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest global PVC producer. During the third quarter of 2016, in order to finance a portion of the consideration and related fees and expenses, and for other general corporate purposes, we issued $1.45 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. In addition, we entered into a   $1.0 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"). 
  In July 2016, OpCo completed planned major maintenance activities, or a turnaround, of its Petro 1 ethylene unit at our Lake Charles, Louisiana site. In conjunction with this turnaround, OpCo also completed an upgrade and capacity expansion of the Petro 1 ethylene unit. The Petro 1 expansion project is expected to increase ethylene capacity by approximately 250 million pounds annually. Income from operations for the third quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted as a result of the lost production, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs related to the planned turnaround and expansion. 
  On July 18, 2016, we announced that our Calvert City facility was in the process of restarting as a result of an unexpected shut down that occurred on June 1, 2016. The unplanned outage was caused by a mechanical failure of OpCo's ethylene unit, which resulted in a complete outage of the facility and halted all production including the production of ethylene dichloride ("EDC"), vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM"), chlor-alkali and PVC resin. Income from operations for the third quarter of 2016

     Table of Contents  

Summary 
  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation was   $65.7 million  , or   $0.51   per diluted share, on net sales of   $1,279.0 million  . This represents a   decrease   in net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of   $117.9 million  , or   $0.88   per diluted share, compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of   $183.6 million  , or   $1.39   per diluted share, on net sales of   $1,188.0 million  . Net income for the   third quarter of 2016   was impacted by (1) pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs of approximately   $82.8 million  , or $0.41 per diluted share, associated with the Merger; (2) pre-tax unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit, an unplanned outage at our Calvert City facility and other planned turnarounds totaling approximately $36.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share; and (3) lost sales associated with such turnarounds and outages, partially offset by (4) realized gain of approximately $49.1 million from the previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall; and (5) a third quarter 2016 effective tax rate of   (10.3)%  . The third quarter 2016 rate resulted from discrete items totaling $28.6 million, which decreased the third quarter 2016 tax provision, and are comprised of $17.2 million related to the non-recognition of tax on the gain recognized attributable to previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall and $15.6 million related to return to provision, amended returns and other adjustments, partially offset by $4.2 million related to non-deductible Axiall acquisition costs. We estimate the 2016 annual tax rate on ordinary income will be approximately 35.6%. Net sales for the   third quarter of 2016     increase  d by   $91.0 million   compared to net sales for the   third quarter of 2015  , mainly due to sales contributed by Axiall, partially offset by lower sales prices and lower sales volumes for most of our major products. Income from operations was   $46.6 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $254.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2015  . The   decrease   in income from operations for the   third quarter of 2016   was mainly a result of lower sales prices for most of our major products, transaction and integration-related costs associated with the Merger and the effect of selling higher cost Axiall inventory recorded at fair value. In addition, income from operations for the   third quarter of 2016   was negatively impacted by the lost sales, lower production rates, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit, the unplanned outage at our Calvert City facility and other planned turnarounds. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation was   $299.9 million  , or   $2.29   per diluted share, on net sales of   $3,340.3 million  . This represents a   decrease   in net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of   $235.1 million  , or   $1.73   per diluted share, from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of   $535.0 million  , or   $4.02   per diluted share, on net sales of   $3,476.6 million  . Net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was impacted by (1) pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs of approximately   $90.6 million  , or $0.45 per diluted share, associated with the Merger; (2) pre-tax unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit, an unplanned outage at our Calvert City facility and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages totaling approximately $116.2 million, or $0.58 per diluted share; and (3) lost sales associated with such turnarounds and outages, partially offset by (4) realized gain of approximately $49.1 million from the previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall; and (5) a lower effective tax rate of   29.1%  . The 2016 period rate resulted from discrete items totaling $29.0 million, which decreased the tax provision for the 2016 period, and are comprised of $17.2 million related to the non-recognition of tax on the gain recognized attributable to the previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall and $16.0 million related to return to provision, amended returns and other adjustments, partially offset by $4.2 million related to non-deductible Axiall acquisition costs. Net sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decrease  d by   $136.3 million   compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to lower sales prices for all our major products and lower sales volumes for ethylene, polyethylene and ethylene co-products, partially offset by higher sales volume for PVC resin and sales contributed by Axiall and Suzhou Huasu Plastics Co., Ltd. ("Huasu"). We acquired a controlling interest in Huasu in June 2015. Income from operations was   $428.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $778.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   mainly attributable to lower sales prices for all our major products, transaction and integration-related costs associated with the Merger and the lost sales, lower production rates, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit, the unplanned outage at our Calvert City facility and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages. The decrease in income from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was partially offset by lower average feedstock and energy costs and higher product margins at our European operations, as compared to the prior-year period.

as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . Overall sales volumes   increase  d by   12.3%   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily attributable to sales contributed by Axiall, as compared to the prior-year period. 
  Gross Profit  . Gross profit margin percentage   decrease  d to   15.8%   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   26.2%   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The third quarter 2016 gross profit was negatively impacted by lower sales prices for most of our major products. Sales prices   decrease  d an average of   4.6%   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . In addition, the lost sales, lower production rates, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit, the unplanned outage at our Calvert City facility and other planned turnarounds further contributed to the decrease in third quarter 2016 gross profit margin. The decrease in third quarter 2016 gross profit margin was compounded by the negative impact of selling higher cost Axiall inventory recorded at fair value. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  . Selling, general and administrative expenses   increase  d by   $15.5 million   to   $72.7 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $57.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . This   increase   was mainly due to general and administrative costs incurred by Axiall for the period from August 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016, partially offset by lower consulting and professional fees and lower payroll and related labor costs, including incentive compensation, as compared to the prior-year period. 
  Transaction and Integration-related Costs  . Transaction and integration-related costs were   $82.8 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   and primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall executives in conjunction with the Merger, including the conversion of Axiall restricted stock units into our restricted stock units, transitional service expenses for certain former Axiall employees, retention agreement costs and consulting and professional fees related to the Merger. 
  Interest Expense  . Interest expense   increase  d by   $16.2 million   to   $24.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $8.2 million   in the   third quarter of 2015   largely as a result of higher average debt outstanding for the period. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt" below for further discussion on our indebtedness. 
  Other Income, Net  . Other income, net   increase  d by   $38.7 million   to   $41.3 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $2.6 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  . The   increase   was primarily attributable to the realized gain of approximately $49.1 million from the previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, partially offset by the bridge loan facility fees written off during the   third quarter of 2016   and other financing costs in connection with the Merger. 
  Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rate was   (10.3)%   for the   third quarter of 2016  . The effective income tax rate for the   third quarter of 2016   was   below   the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the Merger. The effective income tax rate was   24.2%   for the   third quarter of 2015  . The effective income tax rate for the   third quarter of 2015   was   below   the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35.0%   primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the foreign earnings rate differential, the increased benefit in certain prior years' deductions due to a change in the calculation methodology of the domestic manufacturing deduction and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed, partially offset by state income taxes. 
  Olefins Segment  
  Net Sales  . Net sales for the Olefins segment   decrease  d by   $90.7 million  , or   15.4%  , to   $497.4 million   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $588.1 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  , primarily due to lower sales prices and lower sales volumes for our major products, as compared to the prior-year period.

This   decrease   was mainly attributable to lower olefins integrated product margins, primarily due to lower sales prices as compared to the prior-year period, and the lost sales, lower production rates, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs related to the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit and other planned turnarounds during the third quarter of 2016. Trading activity in the   third quarter of 2016   resulted in a   loss   of   $7.8 million   as compared to a   loss   of   $9.3 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  .

operating activities was mainly due to a   decrease   in income from operations, an   increase   in working capital requirements and an increase in deferred turnaround costs associated with OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 turnaround, partially offset by lower income taxes paid, as compared to the prior-year period. Income from operations   decrease  d by   $349.9 million   in the   first nine months of 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period, mostly attributable to (1) lower sales prices for all our major products; (2) transaction and integration-related costs associated with the Merger; and (3) the lost sales, lower production rates, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of OpCo's Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit, the unplanned outage at our Calvert City facility and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages.

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
  Liquidity and Financing Arrangements  
  Our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our long-term financing. 
  In January 2016, OpCo announced an expansion project to increase the ethylene capacity of its ethylene plant at our Calvert City facility. The expansion is expected to increase ethylene capacity by approximately 70 million pounds annually and is targeted for completion during the first half of 2017. Combined with other incremental capacity increases, the total ethylene capacity of OpCo's ethylene plant at our Calvert City facility is expected to increase to 730 million pounds annually at the completion of this project. This capital project is currently estimated to cost in the range of $70.0 million to $80.0 million and is expected to be funded with cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and, if necessary, borrowings under each of the Credit Agreement and OpCo's revolving credit facility with another subsidiary of ours and other external financing. As of

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016  , OpCo had incurred a total cost of approximately $30.5 million on the Calvert City ethylene expansion capital project. 
  In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million share repurchase program (the "2014 Program"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150.0 million. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   no   shares of our common stock were repurchased under the 2014 Program. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had repurchased   4,193,598   shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $228.7 million   under the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time. 
  We believe that our sources of liquidity as described above will be adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. Funding of any potential large expansions or any potential acquisitions would likely necessitate and therefore depend on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. We may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents totaled   $380.5 million  . In addition, we have the Credit Agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under "Debt" below. 
  Debt 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our indebtedness, including current maturities, totaled   $3.8 billion  , consisting of   $100.0 million   of 6  % senior notes due 2029,   $250.0 million   of 6  % senior notes due 2032,   $89.0 million   of 6  % senior notes due 2035 (the "6  % 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes"),   $65.0 million   of 6  % senior notes due 2035 (the "6  % 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes") (collectively, the "Senior Notes"),   $624.8 million   aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2021 (the "  4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes  "),   $63.2 million   aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% senior notes due 2021 (the "  4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes  "),   $250.0 million   principal amount of 3.60% senior notes due 2022,   $433.8 million   aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023 (the "  4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  "),   $16.2 million   aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes due 2023 (the "  4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes  "),   $750.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 3.60% senior notes due 2026 (the "  3.60% 2026 Senior Notes  "),   $700.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due 2046 (the "  5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  "),   $325.0 million   borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, a   $10.9 million   loan from the proceeds of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds (supported by an $11.3 million letter of credit) and a   $150.0 million   current term loan facility, plus unamortized premium net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of   $1.4 million  . The 6  % senior notes due 2029, the 6  % senior notes due 2032, the 6  % 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and the 6  % 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes evidence and secure our obligations to the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facility and Development Authority (the "Authority"), a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, under four loan agreements relating to the issuance of $100.0 million, $250.0 million, $89.0 million and $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Authority's tax-exempt revenue bonds, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement, tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and the term loan facility bore interest at a variable rate. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the covenants with respect to the Senior Notes, the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes  , the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes  , the 3.60% senior notes due 2022, the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  , the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes  , the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes  , the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  , the Credit Agreement, our waste disposal revenue bonds and our term loan facility.  
  Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future. 
  Term Loan 
  On August 10, 2016, our indirect subsidiary, Westlake International Holdings II C.V., a limited partnership organized under the laws of the Netherlands (the "CV Borrower"), entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent and lender, providing the CV Borrower with a   $150.0 million   term loan facility. The term loan facility matures on March 31, 2017. The loans thereunder bear interest at a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus   2.0%   per annum, payable in arrears on the last day of each three-month period following the date of funding and at maturity. The CV Borrower may elect to convert the interest rate to a base rate with a   1.0%   spread.

     Table of Contents  

The facility contains customary covenants and events of default that impose certain operating and financial restrictions on the CV Borrower and certain of its subsidiaries. These restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens and the ability to engage in certain transactions with affiliates. 
  Pursuant to the credit agreement, all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are to remain owned, directly or indirectly, by the CV Borrower and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westlake International II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("WII LLC"). The CV Borrower is also required, together with its subsidiaries, to maintain at all times unencumbered cash and cash equivalents in a U.S. dollar equivalent of not less than   $150.0 million  , which amount shall be increased by   5%   to the extent maintained in non-U.S. currencies. In connection therewith, an amount of cash and cash equivalents for the period (a) from the closing date until the date   30   days thereafter, not less than   $50.0 million  , and (b) thereafter, not less than   $75.0 million  , shall be maintained by the CV Borrower and its subsidiaries in accounts at Bank of America, N.A., in accordance with existing cash management agreements. 
  Obligations under the term loan facility are secured by a pledge of   65%   of the membership interests of WII LLC as well as rights under the partnership agreement of Westlake International Holdings C.V., a limited partnership organized under the laws of The Netherlands, held by WII LLC and the CV Borrower. 
  Credit Agreement 
  On August 23, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), by and among us, the other borrowers and guarantors referred to therein, the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"), the issuing banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. Under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have committed to provide an unsecured   five  -year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $1.0 billion  . The Credit Agreement replaced our existing $400.0 million senior secured third amended and restated credit facility, dated as of July 17, 2014 (the "Prior ABL Credit Agreement"), by and among us, the financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and us and certain of our subsidiaries, as borrowers. The Credit Agreement includes a   $150.0 million   sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary   $50.0 million   commitment for swing-line loans to be provided on a same-day basis. We may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least   $25.0 million  , up to a maximum of   $500.0 million  , subject to certain conditions and if certain Lenders agree to commit to such an increase. On October 14, 2016, certain domestic subsidiaries of Axiall and Lagoon LLC were added as subsidiary guarantors to the Credit Agreement. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $325.0 million   borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at our option, at either (a) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from   1.0%   to   1.75%   that will vary depending on our credit rating or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a spread ranging from   0.0%   to   0.75%   that will vary depending on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement also requires an undrawn commitment fee ranging from   0.10%   to   0.25%   that will vary depending on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement matures on August 23, 2021. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding letters of credit totaling   $76.6 million   and borrowing availability of   $598.4 million   under the Credit Agreement. 
  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our current and future material domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default and if and for so long as an event of default has occurred and is continuing, any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the Lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the Lenders. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. 
  GO Zone and IKE Zone Bonds 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had drawn all the proceeds from the issuance of the 6  % senior notes due 2029, 6  % senior notes due 2032, 6  % 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and 6  % 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt" in the   2015   Form 10-K for more information on the 6  % senior notes due 2029, the 6  % senior notes due 2032, the 6  % 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes and the 6  % 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes. All domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the Senior Notes in excess of $5.0 million are guarantors of these notes. 
  The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants and events of default. Accordingly, these agreements generally impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, among other things, provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends, certain investments and acquisitions  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

and sales of assets. However, the effectiveness of certain of these restrictions is currently suspended because the Senior Notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The most significant of these provisions, if it were currently effective, would restrict us from incurring additional debt, except specified permitted debt (including borrowings under our credit facility), when our fixed charge coverage ratio is below 2.0:1. These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, including, without limitation, an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.10 per share. If the restrictions were currently effective, distributions in excess of $100.0 million would not be allowed unless, after giving pro forma effect to the distribution, our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least 2.0:1 and such payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after January 13, 2006, is less than the sum of 50% of our consolidated net income for the period from October 1, 2003 to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed, plus 100% of net cash proceeds received after October 1, 2003 as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities, plus several other adjustments. 
  3.60% Senior Notes due 2022 
  The 3.60% senior notes due 2022 are unsecured and were issued with an original issue discount of $1.2 million. There is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the 3.60% senior notes due 2022 prior to maturity. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt" in the   2015   Form 10-K for more information on the 3.60% senior notes due 2022. All of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee other indebtedness of ours or of another guarantor of the 3.60% senior notes due 2022 in excess of $5.0 million are guarantors of the 3.60% senior notes due 2022. 
  The indenture governing the 3.60% senior notes due 2022 contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our or their assets. 
  3.60% Senior Notes due 2026 and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2046 
  On August 10, 2016, we completed our private offering of our   $750.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and   $700.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  . The   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   are our senior obligations and are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   and guarantees are unsecured and rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured obligations and each guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured obligations. We have entered into a registration rights agreement in which we have agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement or, under specified circumstances, a shelf registration statement, with the SEC with respect to the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  . The net proceeds from the offering were used to finance the Merger and to repay amounts under the term loan facility dated February 27, 2015 entered into by Axiall Holdco, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Axiall), as the borrower, with the financial institutions party thereto. All of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee other indebtedness of ours or of another guarantor of the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   or   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   in excess of $40.0 million are guarantors of the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  . 
  The indenture governing the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes   and the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes   contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our or their assets. 
  Exchange Offers 
  On September 7, 2016, we completed offers to exchange (the "Axiall Exchange Offers") any and all of the   $688.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and the   $450.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes   (together with the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes  , the "Subsidiary Notes") issued by Axiall for new senior notes issued by us having the same maturity and interest rates as the Subsidiary Notes. The   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes   were assumed at fair value, which resulted in a premium on the Subsidiary Notes of   $33.5 million   and   $15.8 million  , respectively. The Axiall Exchange Offers, pursuant to which   $624.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and   $433.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes   were exchanged, respectively, for   $624.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and   $433.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  , leaving outstanding   $63.2 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and   $16.2 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes  . The Subsidiary Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of Axiall and Eagle Spinco, respectively. The   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   are our senior obligations and are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our

existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   and guarantees are unsecured and rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured obligations and each guarantor's existing and future senior unsecured obligations. We have entered into a registration rights agreement in which we have agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement or, under specified circumstances, a shelf registration statement, with the SEC with respect to the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  . All of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee other indebtedness of ours or of another guarantor of the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   or the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   in excess of $40.0 million are guarantors of the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  . 
  The indenture governing the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes   contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our or their assets. 
  Revenue Bonds 
  In December 1997, we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana. The public trust issued $10.9 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. The waste disposal revenue bonds expire in December 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. Interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. 
  Westlake Chemical Partners LP Credit Arrangements 
  Our subsidiary, Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation, is the lender party to a $300.0 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners"). The revolving credit facility matures in 2018. Borrowings under the revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on Westlake Partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. Westlake Partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled   $135.3 million   and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus   2.0%  . 
  Our subsidiary, Westlake Development Corporation, is the lender party to a $600.0 million revolving credit facility with OpCo. The revolving credit facility matures in 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled   $428.0 million   and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 3.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly. 
  We consolidate Westlake Partners and OpCo for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. As such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and Westlake Partners and OpCo are eliminated upon consolidation. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  None.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
     Commodity Price Risk  
  A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle. We try to protect against such instability through various business strategies. Our strategies include ethylene feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable. We use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products. Based on our open derivative positions at   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical $0.10 increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before taxes by $19.4 million and a hypothetical $0.10 increase in the price of a gallon of propane would have increased our income before taxes by $6.3 million. Additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $485.9 million   principal amount of variable rate debt outstanding. All of the debt outstanding under our current term loan facility, the Credit Agreement and our loan relating to the tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds are at variable rates. We do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt, but we may do so in the future. The average variable interest rate for our variable rate debt of   $485.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   was 2.26%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $4.9 million. Also, at   September 30, 2016  , we had   $3.3 billion   aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt. We are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced. If interest rates were 1% higher at the time of refinancing, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $33.4 million. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our international operations. However, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates caused by our international operations has not had a material impact on our overall operating results. We may engage in activities to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in certain instances through the use of currency exchange derivative instruments, including forward exchange contracts, or spot purchases. A forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified currencies at a stated exchange rate on a stated date.

     We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective with respect to (i) the accumulation and communication to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we submit under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of such information within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

                 Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

The   2015   Form 10-K, filed on   February 24, 2016  , contained a description of various legal proceedings in which we are involved, including environmental proceedings at our facilities in Calvert City. See Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of certain of those proceedings, which information is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 

For a discussion of risk factors, please read Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in the   2015   Form 10-K. The information below includes additional risks relating to our acquisition of Axiall. The risks described below and in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. 
  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses. 
  Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Westlake and Axiall businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Axiall's business practices and operations with our existing business practices and operations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the Merger. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management's attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: 
             
    the diversion of management's attention to integration matters; 
                
    difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining Axiall's business with our business; 
                
    difficulties entering new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where we have no or limited direct prior experience; 
                
    difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; 
                
    difficulties in the assimilation of employees; 
                
    difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; 
                
    successfully managing relationships with our strategic partners and our supplier and customer base; 
                
    challenges in maintaining existing, and establishing new, business relationships; and 
                
    challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel. 
     Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and our results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of our business and Axiall's business are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the Merger, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Furthermore, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and negatively impact us. As a result, we cannot be certain that the combination of the Westlake and Axiall businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the Merger.

The Merger may result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company. 
  The financial results of the combined company may be adversely affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with our integration of the business and operations of Axiall with our existing business and operations. The amount and timing of these possible charges are not yet known. Further, our failure to identify or accurately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities that we are assuming in the Merger could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. The price of our common stock following the Merger could decline to the extent the combined company's financial results are materially affected by any of these events. 
  Our level of debt, including that incurred in connection with the Merger, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
  In connection with the Merger, we substantially increased our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position. As of   September 30, 2016  , our total indebtedness was   $3.8 billion  , and our debt represented approximately   50%   of our total capitalization. Our annual interest expense for 2015 was $34.7 million, net of interest capitalized of $10.4 million. On August 10, 2016, we issued $1.45 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in order to finance part of the Merger consideration. On August 23, 2016, we entered into the Credit Agreement (replacing the Prior ABL Credit Agreement). On September 7, 2016, we completed the Axiall Exchange Offers, pursuant to which   $624.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and   $433.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes   were exchanged for   $624.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and   $433.8 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  , respectively, leaving outstanding   $63.2 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes   and   $16.2 million   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes  . 
  Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our existing or future debt agreements could have significant consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following: 
             
    a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt and will not be available for other purposes, including the payment of dividends; 
                
    we may not be able to obtain necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes; 
                
    our less leveraged competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have greater flexibility to utilize their cash flow to improve their operations; 
                
    we may be exposed to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which would result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates; 
                
    we could be vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business that would leave us less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions; and 
                
    should we pursue additional expansions of existing assets or acquisition of third party assets, we may not be able to obtain additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates. 
     These factors could be magnified or accelerated to the extent we were to finance future acquisitions with significant amounts of debt. 
  The Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions. 
  The Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to: 
             
    pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock; 
                
    make investments and other restricted payments; 
                
    incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; 
                
    create liens; 
                
    permit dividend or other payment restrictions on our restricted subsidiaries; 
     
   56 

     Table of Contents  

sell all or substantially all of our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies; 
                
    engage in transactions with affiliates; and 
                
    engage in sale-leaseback transactions. 
     These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. However, the effectiveness of many of these restrictions in the indenture governing the Senior Notes is currently suspended under the indenture because the Senior Notes are currently rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. 
  The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a quarterly total leverage ratio. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance future business opportunities or acquisitions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related debt. If a default occurred, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, any acceleration of debt under the Credit Agreement will constitute a default under some of our other debt, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the   3.60% 2026 Senior Notes  , the   5.0% 2046 Senior Notes  , the   4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes   and the   4.875% Westlake 2023 Senior Notes  . 

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

The following table provides information on our purchase of equity securities during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

_____________ 
           (1) 
    Represents shares withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to our employees under the 2013 Plan. 
              (2) 
    In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $250.0 million share repurchase program (the "2014 Program"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150.0 million. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   4,193,598   shares of common stock had been acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $228.7 million   under the 2014 Program. Transaction fees and commissions are not reported in the average price paid per share in the table above. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time.

  This Credit Agreement, dated as of August 10, 2016 (this    Agreement   ) among the financial institutions from time to time parties hereto (such financial institutions, together with their respective successors and assigns, are referred to hereinafter each individually as a    Lender        and collectively as the    Lenders   ), Bank of America, N.A. with an office at 901 Main Street, Dallas, Texas, 75202, as agent for the Lenders (in its capacity as agent, the    Agent   ), and WESTLAKE INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS II C.V., a limited  partnership organized under the laws of The Netherlands, having its registered office at The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801, United States of America and its principal place of business at 2801 Post Oak Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America (the    Borrower   ), acting through WESTLAKE OLEFINS CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, United States of America, having its registered office at The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801, United States of America and its principal place of business at 2801 Post Oak Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America, its general partner. 
  ARTICLE I       LOANS  
  SECTION 1.1        Facility  .  Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders agree to make available a total credit facility of up to $150,000,000 (the    Facility   ) to the Borrower from time to time during the term of this Agreement.   
  SECTION 1.2        Loans  . 
  (a)        Loans and Notes  . 
  (i)        Amounts  .  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in   Article 8  , each Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees to make a term loan (the    Loans   ) to the Borrower on the Closing Date in the amount of such Lender s Commitment.   
  (ii)      The Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender so requesting a note to evidence the Loan of that Lender.  Each note shall be in the principal amount of the requesting Lender s Loans, dated the date hereof and substantially in the form of   Exhibit A   (each a    Note        and, collectively, the    Notes   ).  Each Note shall represent the obligation of the Borrower to pay the amount of the requesting Lender s Loans, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Lender s Loans together with interest thereon as prescribed in   Section 2.1  .  The entire unpaid balance of the Loans and all other Obligations (other than contingent obligations and indemnity obligations that survive the termination of this Agreement and are not due and payable at such termination) shall be immediately due and payable in full in immediately available funds on the Maturity Date. 
  (b)        Procedure for Borrowing  . 
  (i)      Each Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable written notice delivered to the Agent in the form of a notice of borrowing in substantially the form of   Exhibit D   (   Notice of Borrowing   ) and signed by the Borrower, which Notice of Borrowing shall be received by the Agent prior to (i) 12:00 noon (Houston, Texas time) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date, in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans and (ii) 12:30 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the requested Funding Date, in the case of Base Rate Loans, specifying: 
  (A)      the amount of the Borrowing, which in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan must equal or exceed $5,000,000 (and integral increments of $1,000,000 in excess of such amount or the entire amount of the Facility); 
  (B)      the requested Funding Date, which must be a Business Day; and 
  (C)      whether the Loans requested are to be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans (and if not specified, it shall be deemed a request for a Base Rate Loan). 
  
   1 

(ii)      In lieu of delivering a Notice of Borrowing, the Borrower may give the Agent telephonic notice of such request for advances to the Designated Account on or before the deadline set forth above.  The Agent at all times shall be entitled to rely on such telephonic notice in making such Loans, regardless of whether any written confirmation is received. 
  (c)        Reliance upon Authority  .  Prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, a notice setting forth the account of the Borrower (   Designated Account   ) to which the Agent is authorized to transfer the proceeds of the Loans requested hereunder.  The Agent is entitled to rely conclusively on any person s request for Loans on behalf of the Borrower, so long as the proceeds thereof are to be transferred to the Designated Account.  The Agent has no duty to verify the identity of any individual representing himself or herself as a person authorized by the Borrower to make such requests on its behalf. 
  (d)        No Liability  .  The Agent shall not incur any liability to the Borrower as a result of acting upon any notice referred to in   Sections 1.2(b)   and   (c)  , which the Agent believes in good faith to have been given by an officer or other person duly authorized by the Borrower to request Loans on its behalf.  The crediting of Loans to the Designated Account conclusively establishes the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loans as provided herein. 
  (e)        Notice Irrevocable  .  Any Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) made pursuant to   Section 1.2(b)   shall be irrevocable.  The Borrower shall be bound to borrow the funds requested therein in accordance therewith. 
  (f)        Making of Loans  .  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing or telephonic notice in lieu thereof, the Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone or e-mail of the requested Borrowing.  Each Lender shall transfer its Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to the Agent in immediately available funds, to the account from time to time designated by the Agent, not later than 2:30 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the applicable Funding Date.  After the Agent s receipt of all proceeds of such Loans, the Agent shall make the proceeds of such Loans available to the Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring same day funds to the Designated Account. 
  ARTICLE II        INTEREST AND FEES 
  SECTION 2.1        Interest  . 
  (a)        Interest Rates  .  All outstanding Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof (including, to the extent permitted by law, on interest thereon not paid when due) from the date made until paid in full in cash at a rate determined by reference to (x) the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate plus (y) the Applicable Margin, but not to exceed the Maximum Rate.  If at any time Loans are outstanding with respect to which the Borrower has not delivered to the Agent a notice specifying the basis for determining the interest rate applicable thereto in accordance herewith, those Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin (unless the Default Rate has been effected by the Agent and the Required Lenders pursuant to   Section 2.1(b)  ) until notice to the contrary has been given to the Agent in accordance with this Agreement and such notice has become effective.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the outstanding Loans shall bear interest as follows: 
  (i)      For all Base Rate Loans at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and 
  (ii)      For all LIBOR Rate Loans at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin. 
  Each change in the Base Rate shall be reflected in the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans as of the effective date of such change.  All interest charges for LIBOR Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  All interest charges for Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and for actual days elapsed.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, interest accrued on all Base Rate Loans in arrears on the first day of each month hereafter and on the Maturity Date.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, interest on all LIBOR Rate Loans in arrears on each LIBOR Interest Payment Date.  The Agent does not warrant or accept responsibility for, nor shall it have any liability with respect to, administration, submission or any other matter related to any rate described in the definition of LIBOR Rate. 
  
   2 

(b)        Default Rate  .  If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Agent or the Required Lenders in their discretion so elect, then, while any such Event of Default is continuing, (i) the principal amount of all Loans shall bear interest at the Default Rate applicable thereto; and (ii) any other amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall bear interest at the Default Rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. 
  SECTION 2.2        Continuation and Conversion Elections  . 
  (a)      The Borrower may: 
  (i)      elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Loans, to convert any Base Rate Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) into LIBOR Rate Loans; or 
  (ii)      elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to continue any LIBOR Rate Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $1,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); 
  provided  , that if at any time the aggregate amount of LIBOR Rate Loans in respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to be less than $1,000,000, such LIBOR Rate Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans. 
  (b)      The Borrower shall deliver a notice of continuation/conversion (   Notice of Continuation/Conversion   ) to the Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Houston, Texas time) at least three (3) Business Days in advance of the Continuation/Conversion Date, if the Loans are to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans and specifying: 
  (i)      the proposed Continuation/Conversion Date; 
  (ii)      the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or continued; and 
  (iii)      the type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion or continuation. 
  (c)      If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to LIBOR Rate Loans, the Borrower has failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to LIBOR Rate Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period. 
  (d)      The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Continuation/Conversion.  All conversions and continuations shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the notice was given held by each Lender. 
  (e)      There may not be more than twelve (12) different LIBOR Rate Loans in effect hereunder at any time. 
  SECTION 2.3        Maximum Interest Rate  .  In no event shall any interest rate provided for hereunder (including any fees or other fees or other compensation which are deemed or determined to be interest) exceed the maximum rate legally chargeable by any Lender under applicable law for such Lender with respect to loans of the type provided for hereunder (the    Maximum Rate   ).  If, for any period, any interest, absent such limitation, would have exceeded the Maximum Rate, then the interest rate for that period shall be the Maximum Rate, and, if in future periods, that interest rate would otherwise be less than the Maximum Rate, then that interest rate shall remain at the Maximum Rate until such time as the amount of interest paid hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been paid if the same had not been limited by the Maximum Rate.  In the event that, upon payment in full of the Obligations, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement is less than the total amount of interest which would, but for this   Section 2.3  , have been paid or accrued if the interest rate otherwise set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have been charged if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest which would have accrued had the interest rate otherwise set forth in this Agreement, at all times, been in effect over (b) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued under this Agreement.  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Agent and/or any Lender has received interest and other charges hereunder in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess shall be deemed received on account of, and shall automatically be applied to reduce, the Obligations  
  
   3 

other than interest, in the inverse order of maturity, and if there are no Obligations outstanding, the Agent and/or such Lender shall refund to the Borrower such excess. 
  SECTION 2.4        Closing Fee  .  The Borrower shall pay the Agent for its account the fees described in the Engagement Letter (the    Closing Fee   ). 
  ARTICLE III        PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS 
  SECTION 3.1        Loans  .  The Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal balance of the Loans, plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, on the Maturity Date.  The Borrower may prepay Loans at any time, and any amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed.   
  SECTION 3.2        Prepayments of the Loans  . 
  (a)        Optional  .  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;   provided   that (A) such notice must be received by the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (1) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender s Applicable Percentage in respect of the Facility).  If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.   
  (b)        Mandatory  .  In the event that the Agent receives written advice from a nationally recognized tax counsel that there is a more likely than not probability that the Facility will be recast as equity under final or temporary U.S. Treasury regulations under Internal Revenue Code section 385, the Borrower shall repay the Facility promptly (and no later than 10 days) upon receiving written notice to the foregoing effect. 
  SECTION 3.3        LIBOR Rate Loan Prepayments  .  In connection with any prepayment, if any LIBOR Rate Loans are prepaid prior to the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall pay to the Lenders the amounts described in   Section 4.5  . 
  SECTION 3.4        Payments by the Borrower  . 
  (a)      All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without set off, recoupment or counterclaim.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, at the account designated by the Agent and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 12:00 noon (Houston, Texas time) on the date specified herein.  Any payment received by the Agent after such time shall be deemed (for purposes of calculating interest only) to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest shall continue to accrue. 
  (b)      Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of    Interest Period  ,      whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be due on the following Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be. 
  SECTION 3.5        Apportionment, Application and Reversal of Payments  .  Principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and payments of the fees shall, as applicable, be apportioned ratably among the Lenders, except for fees payable solely to the Agent and except as provided in   Section 11.1(b)   or   12.14(e)  .  All payments shall be remitted to the Agent and all such payments not relating to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Agent following the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default shall be applied, ratably, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, first, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements then due to the Agent from the Borrower; second, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower; third, to pay interest due in respect of  
  
   4 

all Loans; and fourth, to pay or prepay principal of the Loans.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall apply any payments which it receives to any LIBOR Rate Loan, except (a) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such LIBOR Rate Loan, or (b) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding Base Rate Loans and, in any event, the Borrower shall pay LIBOR breakage losses in accordance with   Section 4.5  . 
  SECTION 3.6        Indemnity for Returned Payments  .  If after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, the Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Agent or such Lender and the Borrower shall be liable to pay to the Agent and the Lenders, and hereby do indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless for the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered.  The provisions of this   Section 3.6   shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Agent s and the Lenders  rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and irrevocable.  The provisions of this   Section 3.6   shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
  SECTION 3.7        Agent s and Lenders  Books and Records; Monthly Statements  .  The Agent shall record the principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender from time to time on its books.  In addition, each Lender may note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Lender s Loans in its books and records.  Failure by the Agent or any Lender to make such notation shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower with respect to the Loans.  The Borrower agrees that the Agent s and each Lender s books and records showing the Obligations and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be admissible in any action or proceeding arising therefrom, and shall constitute rebuttably presumptive proof thereof, absent manifest error, irrespective of whether any Obligation is also evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument.   
  ARTICLE IV        TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
  SECTION 4.1        Taxes  . 
  (a)        Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Tax Payment  . 
  (i)      All payments of the Obligations by the Loan Parties shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Requirement of Law.  If Requirement of Law (as determined by an applicable Withholding Agent in its discretion) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Agent or a Loan Party, then the Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding based on information and documentation provided pursuant to   Section 4.2  . 
  (ii)      If the Agent or any Loan Party is required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (i) the Agent or applicable Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount to be withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority, and (ii) to the extent the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that the Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
  (iii)      If the Agent or any Loan Party is required by any Requirement of Law other than the Code to withhold or deduct Taxes from any payment, then (i) the Agent or such Loan Party, to the extent required by Requirement of Law, shall timely pay the full amount to be withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority, and (ii) to the extent the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that the Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
  
   5 

(b)        Payment of Other Taxes  .  Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Requirement of Law, or at the Agent s option, timely reimburse the Agent for payment of, any Other Taxes. 
  (c)        Tax Indemnification  . 
  (i)      The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless each Recipient against any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this   Section  ) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The Borrower shall make payment within 10 days after demand for any amount or liability payable under this Section.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of any Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (ii)      Each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless, on a several basis, the Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent the Borrower have not already paid or reimbursed the Agent therefor and without limiting the Borrower  obligation to do so), that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Obligations, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  Each Lender shall make payment within 10 days after demand for any amount or liability payable under this   Section  .  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (d)        Evidence of Payments  .  If the Agent or a Loan Party pays any Taxes pursuant to this   Section  , then upon request, the Agent shall deliver to the Borrower or the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, respectively, a copy of a receipt issued by the appropriate Governmental Authority evidencing the payment, a copy of any return required by Requirement of Law to report the payment, or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent or the Borrower, as applicable. 
  (e)        Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  Unless required by Requirement of Law, at no time shall the Agent or the Borrower have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, nor have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of a Lender.  If a Recipient determines in its reasonable discretion that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),   provided   that the Borrower agrees, upon request by the Recipient, to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient if the Recipient is required to repay such refund to the Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Recipient shall be required to pay any amount to the Borrower if such payment would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  In no event shall the Agent or any Recipient be required to make its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) available to any Loan Party or other Person. 
  (f)        Survival  .  Each party s obligations under   Sections 4.1   and   4.2   shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by or replacement of a Lender, the termination of the Commitments, and the repayment, satisfaction, discharge or Full Payment of any Obligations. 
  SECTION 4.2        Lender Tax Information  . 
  (a)        Status of Lenders  .  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments of Obligations shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or  
  
   6 

the Agent, shall promptly deliver such other documentation prescribed by Requirement of Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent to enable them to determine whether such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, such documentation (other than documentation described in   Sections 4.2(b)(i)  ,   (ii)   and   (iv)  ) shall not be required if a Lender reasonably believes delivery of the documentation would subject it to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice its legal or commercial position. 
  (b)        Documentation  .  Without limiting the foregoing, if any Loan Party is a U.S. Person, 
  (i)      Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender hereunder (and from time to time thereafter upon reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9, certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax; 
  (ii)      Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender hereunder (and from time to time thereafter upon reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
  (A)      in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or IRS Form W-8BENE, as applicable) establishing an exemption from or reduction of U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty, and (y) with respect to other payments under the Loan Documents, IRS Form W-8BEN (or IRS Form W-8BENE, as applicable) establishing an exemption from or reduction of U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty; 
  (B)      executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
  (C)      in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate in form satisfactory to the Agent and the Borrower to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (   U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate   ), and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN (or IRS Form W-8BENE, as applicable); or

  (c)        Redelivery of Documentation  .

  (a)      If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make LIBOR Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by that Lender to the Borrower through the Agent together with an explanation of the circumstances, any obligation of that Lender to make LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until that Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. 
  (b)      If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan, the Borrower shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such LIBOR Rate Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under   Section 4.5  , either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if that Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if that Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and if applicable convert to Base Rate Loans.

  SECTION 4.4        Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy  . 
  (a)        Change in Law  .  If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, liquidity, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in calculating LIBOR Rate);

  (iii)      impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost, or expense affecting any Loan, Loan Document or Commitment; 
  and the result thereof shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loan or Commitment, or converting to or continuing any interest option for a Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will, within ten (10) days of receipt of the certificate delivered by the Agent under   Section 4.7  , pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)        Capital Adequacy  .  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or holding company s capital as a consequence of this Agreement, or such Lender s Commitments, Loans to a level below that which such Lender or holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s and holding company s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate it or its holding company for any such reduction suffered, in each case, within ten (10) days of receipt of the certificate delivered under   Section 4.7  .

SECTION 4.5        Funding Losses  .

Lenders shall not be required to purchase Dollar deposits in the London interbank market or any other offshore Dollar market to fund any LIBOR Rate Loan, but the provisions hereof shall be deemed to apply as if each Lender had purchased such deposits to fund its LIBOR Rate Loans. 
  SECTION 4.6        Inability to Determine Rates  .  The Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and Lenders if, in connection with any Loan or request for a Loan, (a) the Agent determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable Loan amount or Interest Period, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period; or (b) the Agent or Required Lenders determine for any reason that LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lenders of funding the Loan.  Thereafter, Lenders  obligations to make or maintain affected LIBOR Rate Loans and utilization of the LIBOR component (if affected) in determining Base Rate shall be suspended until the Agent (upon instruction by Required Lenders) withdraws the notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or, failing that, will be deemed to have requested a Base Rate Loan. 
  SECTION 4.7        Certificates of the Agent  .  If any Lender claims reimbursement or compensation under this   Article 4  , the Agent shall determine the amount thereof and shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the affected Lender) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to the affected Lender, and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. 
  SECTION 4.8        Delay in Requests  .  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this   Section   shall not constitute a waiver of its right to demand such compensation, but the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that a Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
  SECTION 4.9        Mitigation  .  If any Lender gives a notice under   Section 4.3   or requests compensation under   Section 4.4  , or if the Loan Parties are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts with respect to a Lender under   Section 4.1  , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate the need for such notice or reduce amounts payable in the future, as applicable; and (b) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
  SECTION 4.10        Replacement of Lenders  .  If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 4.4  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 4.1  , or if any Lender gives notice under   Section 4.3  , at the Borrower s request, the Agent or an Eligible Assignee shall have the right (but not the obligation) with the Agent s approval, to purchase from such Lender, and such Lender agrees that it shall sell, all its Commitments for an amount equal to the principal balances thereof and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale pursuant to Assignment and Acceptance, without premium or discount.  The Agent is irrevocably appointed as attorney-in-fact to execute any such Assignment and Acceptance if such Lender fails to execute same within twenty (20) days of such request of assignment.  Such Lender shall be entitled to receive, in cash, concurrently with such assignment, all amounts owed to it under the Loan Documents, including all principal, interest and fees through the date of assignment (but excluding any prepayment charge). 
  SECTION 4.11        Survival  .  The agreements and obligations of the Borrower in this   Article 4   shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

  (b)      From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Lender that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance (and consent of the Agent thereto, if required) and payment of the above-referenced processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents (except for such rights and obligations not available to such assignee by express terms of this Agreement), and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). 
  (c)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties, or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto or the attachment, perfection, or priority of any Lien granted by any Loan Party to the Agent or any Lender in the Collateral; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will, independently (without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time), continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers, including the discretionary rights and incidental power, as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such Assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. 
  (d)      Immediately upon satisfaction of the requirements of   Section 11.2(a)  , this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom.  The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto. 
  (e)      Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other Persons not Affiliates of the Borrower (a    Participant   ) participating interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Lender and the other interests of that Lender (the    Originating Lender   ) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;   provided  ,   however  , that (i) the Originating Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (ii) the Originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations; (iii) the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Originating Lender in connection with the Originating Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except the matters set forth in   Section 11.1(a)(i)  ,   (ii)  , and   (iii)  , and all amounts payable by the Loan Parties hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same  
  
   21 

extent and subject to the same limitation as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement. 
  (f)      Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR  203.14, or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and such Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law. 
  (g)      No assignment or participation may be made to the Borrower, Affiliate of the Borrower, Defaulting Lender or natural person.  In connection with any assignment by a Defaulting Lender, such assignment shall be effective only upon payment by the Eligible Assignee or Defaulting Lender to the Agent of an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution (through direct payment, purchases of participations or other compensating actions as the Agent deems appropriate), (a) to satisfy all funding and payment liabilities then owing by the Defaulting Lender hereunder, and (b) to acquire its Pro Rata Share of all Loans.  If an assignment by a Defaulting Lender shall become effective under applicable Requirement of Law for any reason without compliance with the foregoing sentence, then the assignee shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender for all purposes until such compliance occurs. 
  (h)      Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower (solely for tax purposes), maintain a register in which it enters the Participant s name, address and interest in Commitments, Loans (and stated interest).  Entries in the register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person recorded in the register as the owner of the participation for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  No Lender shall have an obligation to disclose any information in such register except to the extent necessary to establish that a Participant s interest is in registered form under the Code. 
  ARTICLE XII    THE AGENT 
  SECTION 12.1        Appointment and Authorization  .  Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Bank of America as its Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this   Article 12  .  The provisions of this   Article 12   are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and the Borrower shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions contained herein.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term    agent        in this Agreement with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions which the Agent is expressly entitled to take or assert under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the exercise of remedies pursuant to   Section 9.2  , and any action so taken or not taken shall be deemed consented to by the Lenders. 
  SECTION 12.2        Delegation of Duties  .  The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees, or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney in fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
  SECTION 12.3        Liability of Agent  .  None of the Agent Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b)  
  
   22 

be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation, or warranty made by the Borrower, any Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books, or records of the Borrower or any Affiliates of the Borrower. 
  SECTION 12.4        Reliance by Agent  .  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document, or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or all Lenders if so required by   Section 11.1  ) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders. 
  SECTION 12.5        Notice of Default  .  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a    notice of default.         The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.  The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with   Section 9  ;   provided  ,   however  , that unless and until the Agent has received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable. 
  SECTION 12.6        Credit Decision  .  Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower and its Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender.  Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently (without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate), made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently (without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time), continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals, and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession of any of the Agent Related Persons. 
  SECTION 12.7        Indemnification  .  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Agent Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities as such term is defined in   Section 13.11  ;   provided  ,   however  , that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Agent Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or out of pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or  
  
   23 

otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.  The undertaking in this   Section 12.7   shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Agent. 
  SECTION 12.8        Agent in Individual Capacity  .  The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire Capital Stock in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with the Borrower and its Affiliates as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders.  The Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower and its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or its Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.  With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms    Lender        and    Lenders        include Bank of America in its individual capacity. 
  SECTION 12.9        Successor Agent  .  The Agent may resign as Agent upon at least thirty (30) days prior notice to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Agent.  In the event Bank of America sells all of its Commitment and Loans as part of a sale, transfer or other disposition by Bank of America of substantially all of its loan portfolio, Bank of America shall resign as Agent and such purchaser or transferee shall become the successor Agent hereunder.  Subject to the foregoing, if the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders.  If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders or, if no Lender accepts such role, the Agent may appoint Required Lenders as successor Agent.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, or upon appointment of Required Lenders as successor Agent, (a) such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent, (b) the term    Agent        shall mean such successor agent, (c) the retiring Agent s appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated.  After any retiring Agent s resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this   Article 12   shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.  The Agent and successor agent shall execute all documents necessary to transfer any Agent s Liens on any Collateral to the successor Agent. 
  SECTION 12.10        Collateral Matters  . 
  (a)      The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release any Agent s Liens upon any Collateral upon the termination of the Commitments and Full Payment of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnity and expense reimbursement claims not then due).  Except as provided above, the Agent will not release any of the Agent s Liens without the prior written authorization of the Lenders.  Upon request by the Agent or the Borrower at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent s authority to release any Agent s Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this   Section 12.10  . 
  (b)      Upon receipt by the Agent of any authorization required pursuant to   Section 12.10(a)   from the Lenders of the Agent s authority to release the Agent s Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral, and upon at least five (5) Business Days  prior written request by the Borrower, the Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Agent s Liens upon such Collateral;   provided  ,   however  , that (i) the Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent s opinion, would expose the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of any Loan Party in respect of) all interests retained by any Loan Party, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. 
  (c)      The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Loan Party or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, the Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given the Agent s own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that the Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing. 
  
   24 

SECTION 12.11        Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments  . 
  (a)      Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by the Agent, take or cause to be taken any action to enforce its rights under this Agreement or against any Loan Party, including the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral. 
  (b)      If at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations of any Loan Party to such Lender arising under, or relating to, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender from the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from the Agent in excess of such Lender s ratable portion of all such distributions by the Agent, such Lender shall promptly (1) turn the same over to the Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Agent, or in same day funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (2) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares;   provided  ,   however  , that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery of the excess payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Defaulting Lender obtains a payment or reduction of any Obligation, it shall immediately turn over the amount thereof to the Agent for application under   Section 12.14(e)   and it shall provide a written statement to the Agent describing the Obligation affected by such payment or reduction. 
  SECTION 12.12        Agency for Perfection  .  Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting the Lenders  security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC can be perfected only by possession or control.  Should any Lender (other than the Agent) obtain possession or control of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Agent s request therefor shall deliver such Collateral or control thereof to the Agent or in accordance with the Agent s instructions. 
  SECTION 12.13        Payments by Agent to Lenders  .  All payments to be made by the Agent to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire transfer or internal transfer of immediately available funds to each Lender pursuant to wire transfer instructions delivered in writing to the Agent on or prior to the Closing Date (or if such Lender is an Assignee, on the applicable Assignment and Acceptance), or pursuant to such other wire transfer instructions as each party may designate for itself by written notice to the Agent.  Concurrently with each such payment, the Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium, or interest on the Loans or otherwise.  Unless the Agent receives notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent the Borrower has not made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid. 
  SECTION 12.14        Settlement 
  (a)      Lenders' Failure to Perform  .  All Loans shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.  It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Loans hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Loans hereunder, (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligation to make any Loans hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligation to make any Loans hereunder, and (iii) the obligations of each Lender hereunder shall be several, not joint and several. 
  (b)        Defaulting Lenders  .  Unless the Agent receives notice from a Lender at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of a Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Agent that Lender s Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date.  Furthermore, the Agent may, in reliance  
  
   25 

upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If any Lender has not transferred its full Pro Rata Share to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent has transferred corresponding amount to the Borrower on the Business Day following such Funding Date, that Lender shall make such amount available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for that day.  A notice by the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If each Lender s full Pro Rata Share is transferred to the Agent as required, the amount transferred to the Agent shall constitute that Lender s Loan for all purposes of this Agreement.  If that amount is not transferred to the Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, the Agent will notify the Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Agent, the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent for the Agent s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising that particular Borrowing.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any Funding Date shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Loan on that Funding Date.  No Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender s failure to advance such other Lenders  Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing. 
  (c)        Reallocation of Pro Rata Share; Amendments  .  For purposes of determining Lenders  obligations to fund or participate in the Loans, the Agent may exclude the Commitments and Loans of any Defaulting Lender(s) from the calculation of Pro Rata Shares.  A Defaulting Lender shall have no right to vote on any amendment, waiver or other modification of a Loan Document, except as provided in   Section 11.1  . 
  (d)        Payments  .  The Agent may, in its discretion, receive and retain any amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender under the Loan Documents, and a Defaulting Lender     shall be deemed to have assigned to the Agent such amounts until all Obligations owing to the Agent and non-Defaulting Lenders have been paid in full.  The Agent may apply such amounts to the Defaulting Lender s defaulted obligations or readvance the amounts to the Borrower hereunder.   
  (e)        Cure  .  The Borrower and the Agent may agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender.  At such time, Pro Rata Shares shall be reallocated without exclusion of such Lender s Commitments and Loans, and all outstanding Loans and other exposures hereunder shall be reallocated among the Lenders and settled by the Agent (with appropriate payments by the reinstated Lender) in accordance with the readjusted Pro Rata Shares.  Unless expressly agreed by the Borrower and the Agent, no reinstatement of a Defaulting Lender shall constitute a waiver or release of claims against such Lender.  The failure of any Lender to fund a Loan or otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations, and no Lender shall be responsible for default by another Lender. 
  SECTION 12.15        Concerning the Collateral and the Related Loan Documents  .  Each Lender authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the other Loan Documents, for the ratable benefit and obligation of the Agent and the Lenders, and to amend the Schedules to the Loan Documents without a separate amendment to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents signed by the requisite Lenders if the underlying transactions necessitating such amendments of the Schedules are permitted under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Agent or Required Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Agent or the Required Lenders, as applicable, of their respective powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.  The Lenders acknowledge that the Loans and all interest, fees and expenses hereunder constitute one Debt, secured pari passu by all of the Collateral. 
  SECTION 12.16        Relation Among Lenders  .  The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender.   
  ARTICLE XIII    MISCELLANEOUS 
  SECTION 13.1        No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies  .  No failure by the Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement or any present or future supplement thereto, or in any other agreement between or among the Borrower and the Agent and/or any Lender, or delay by the Agent or any Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver by the Agent or any Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically stated.  No waiver by the Agent or the Lenders on any occasion shall affect or diminish the Agent s and each Lender s rights thereafter to require strict performance by the Borrower of any provision of this Agreement.  The Agent and the Lenders may proceed directly to collect the Obligations without  
  
   26 

any prior recourse to the Collateral.  The Agent s and each Lender s rights under this Agreement will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the Agent or any Lender may have. 
  SECTION 13.2        Severability  .  The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

  SECTION 13.15        Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by the Agent, each Lender and the Borrower in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same agreement; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document.

  SECTION 13.17        Right of Setoff  .  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or the Loans have been accelerated, the Agent, each Lender and any of their respective Affiliates are authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Loan Party, any such notice being waived by each Loan Party to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, the Agent, such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all Obligations (for the benefit of all Lenders as provided herein), now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Lender agrees to promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender;   provided  ,   however  , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off and application.  If any Lender shall obtain any payment or prepayment with respect to the Obligation as a result of exercising its right under this   Section 13.16   which is in excess of its share of any such payment in accordance with the relevant rights of the Lenders under the Loan Documents, then such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment with each other Lender in accordance with the relevant rights under the Loan Documents.  If all or any portion of such excess payment is subsequently recovered from such purchasing Lender, then the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery.  Each Loan Party agrees that any Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this   Section   may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all of its rights of payment (including the right of offset) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

  SECTION 13.22        Judgment Currency  .  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the

  (a)      the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an EEA Financial Institution; and

  (i)      a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
  (ii)      a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
  (iii)      the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
