        ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

   Basis of Presentation    
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and in accordance with
instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
contained in this report reflect all adjustments that are normal and recurring
in nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The
year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial
statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results
of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the
results expected for the full year. These unaudited, condensed consolidated
financial statements, footnote disclosures and other information should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
   Organization     Omphalos
Corp. was incorporated as Soyodo Group Holdings, Inc. (the  Soyodo ) under the
laws of Delaware in March 2003. On February 5, 2008, Soyodo acquired the
outstanding shares of Omphalos Corp. Omphalos Corp. (the  Omphalos BVI) was
incorporated on October 30, 2001 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.
For accounting purposes, the acquisition was treated as a recapitalization of
Omphalos BVI. Omphalos BVI owns 100% of Omphalos Corp. (Taiwan), All Fine
Technology Co., Ltd. (Taiwan), and All Fine Technology Co., Ltd. (B.V.I.).
Omphalos Corp. (Taiwan) and was incorporated on February 13, 1991 under the laws
of Republic of China. All Fine Technology Co., Ltd. (Taiwan) was incorporated on
March 23, 2004 under the laws of Republic of China. All Fine Technology Co.,
Ltd. (B.V.I.) was incorporated on February 2, 2005 under the laws of the British
Virgin Islands. Omphalos Corp. (B.V.I.) and its subsidiaries supplies a wide
range of equipment and parts including reflow soldering ovens and automated
optical inspection machines for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers in
Taiwan and China.  
 Effective April 18, 2008 Soyodo entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Omphalos,
Corp., a Nevada corporation. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Soyodo was merged
with and into the surviving corporation, Omphalos Corp. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation became the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company, and the directors and officers of
Soyodo became the members of the board of directors and officers of the Company.
Following the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware and Nevada, a Certificate of Merger. Omphalos,
Corp is incorporated on April 15, 2008 under the laws of the state of Nevada.
The main purpose of the merger is to change the company s name to Omphalos,
Corp. 
   Basis of Consolidation    
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Omphalos
Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated. 
   Going Concern      
  The Company has incurred a significant net loss during the past two
years and had an accumulated deficit of $1,646,972 and $1,482,612 as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the
recovery of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. This presentation presumes funds will be available to
finance ongoing research and development, operations and capital expenditures
and permit the realization of assets and the payment of liabilities in the
normal course of operations for the foreseeable future.  
 4 

There can be no assurances that there
will be adequate financing available to the Company and the consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.  
 The Company has taken certain
restructuring steps to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations.
These steps included: (1) Tightly budgeting and controlling all expenses; (2)
Expanding product lines and recruiting a strong sales team to significantly
increase sales revenue and profit in 2016; (3) The Company plans to continue
actively seeing additional funding opportunities to improve and expand upon its
product lines.  
   Use of Estimates     The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
   Cash and Cash Equivalents
    Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash in time
deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less. 
   Accounts Receivable    
Accounts receivables are carried at original invoice amount less estimates made
for doubtful receivables. Management determines the allowance for doubtful
accounts on a quarterly basis based on a review of the current status of
existing receivables, account aging, historical collection experience,
subsequent collections, management's evaluation of the effect of existing
economic conditions, and other known factors. The provision is provided for the
above estimates made for all doubtful receivables. Account balances are charged
off against the allowance only when the Company considers it is probable that a
receivable will not be recovered. Recoveries of trade receivables previously
written off are recorded when received.  
   Inventory     Inventory is
carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by using the specific
identification method. The Company periodically reviews the age and turnover of
its inventory to determine whether any inventory has become obsolete or has
declined in value, and charges to operations for known and anticipated inventory
obsolescence. Inventory consists substantially of finished goods and is net of
an allowance for slow-moving inventory of $439,299 and $485,767 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   Property and Equipment    
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets as follows:  

Automobile  
     5 years   
   
     Furniture and fixtures  
     3 years   
   
     Machinery and equipment  
     3 to 5 years   
   
     Leasehold improvements  
     55 years    

 Expenditures for major renewals and
betterment that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are
capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as
incurred. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the
resulting profit or loss is reflected in the statement of income for the
period.   The accumulated depreciation was $111,096 and $102,516 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Depreciation expense was
$3,475 and $3,531 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Depreciation expense was $1,213 and $1,156 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 5 

Intangible Assets    
Include cost of patent applications that are deferred and charged to operations
over their useful lives. The accumulated amortization is $33,706 and $29,858 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Amortization of
intangible assets was $2,315 and $2,382 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets was $788 and $780
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
   Revenue Recognition     The
Company derives revenues from the sale of equipment and parts to customers. The
Company s standard shipping term is Free on Board (FOB) shipping point. The
Company recognizes revenue upon shipment for the sales under the term FOB
shipping point. For the sales under other shipping term arrangements, such as
FOB destination, the Company recognizes revenue when title passes to and the
risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer based on the
terms of the sales. Usually no returns, discounts or other allowances are
provided to customers. Shipping and handling charges to   customers are
included in net sales. Shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company are
included in cost of goods sold.  
   Leases       Lease
agreements are evaluated to determine if they are capital leases meeting any of
the following criteria at inception: (a) Transfer of ownership; (b) Bargain
purchase option; (c) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the
estimated economic life of the leased property; (d) The present value at the
beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that
portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance,
maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon,
equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased
property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit
retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor.  
 If at its inception a lease meets any
of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the lessee as a
capital lease; and if none of the four criteria are met, the lease is classified
by the lessee as an operating lease.  
   Research and Development Expenses
    Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred.
 
   Statement of cash
flows       In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230,  Statement of Cash
Flows,  cash flows from the Company s operations are calculated based upon the
local currencies, and translated to the reporting currency using an average
foreign exchange rate for the reporting period. As a result, amounts related to
changes in assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will
not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance
sheets.  
   Income Taxes     The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes,
which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets
based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in
the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit
(expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax
liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax
assets will not be realized.  
   Stock Based Compensation
    The Company applies the fair value provisions of ASC 718,
 Compensation-Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ). ASC 718 requires the
recognition of compensation expense, using a fair-value based method, for costs
related to all share-based payments including stock options. ASC 718 requires
companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant
date using an option pricing model. The Company does not have any awards of
stock-based compensation issued and outstanding at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.  
   Loss Per Share     The
Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings
Per Share ( ASC 260-10 ) which specifies the computation, presentation and
disclosure requirements of earnings per share information. Basic earnings per
share have been calculated based upon the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of the diluted loss per share if their effect would
be anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any
common equivalent shares.  
 6 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
    The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic
360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360-10 ). ASC 360-10 requires that
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the
Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The
Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment annually or more often if
events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include
significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a
forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended
period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon
forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the
carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of
future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of
the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. Management
has determined that no impairments of long-lived assets currently exist.  
   Foreign-currency Transactions
    Foreign-currency transactions are recorded in New Taiwan dollar
( NTD ) at the rates of exchange in effect when the transactions occur. Gains or
losses resulting from the application of different foreign exchange rates when
cash in foreign currency is converted into New Taiwan dollar, or when
foreign-currency receivables or payables are settled, are credited or charged to
income in the year of conversion or settlement. On the balance sheet dates, the
balances of foreign-currency assets and liabilities are restated at the
prevailing exchange rates and the resulting differences are charged to current
income except for those foreign currencies denominated investments in shares of
stock where such differences are accounted for as translation adjustments under
stockholders  deficit. 
   Translation Adjustment    
The Company financial statements are presented in the U.S. dollar ($), which is
the Company s reporting currency, while its functional currency is New Taiwan
dollar ( NTD ). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
functional currency rate ruling at the date of transaction. Any differences
between the initially recorded amount and the settlement amount are recorded as
a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated statements of
income. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are
translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. Any differences are taken to profit or loss as a gain or loss on
foreign currency translation in the statements of income. 
 In accordance with ASC 830, Foreign
Currency Matters, the Company translates the assets and liabilities into U.S.
dollar ($) using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and
the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at an average rate
during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation from NTD
into U.S. dollar are recorded in stockholders  deficit as part of accumulated
other comprehensive income. 
   Reclassifications   
   Certain classifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had
no impact on previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.  
   Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
"Leases," which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on
the balance sheet of lessees. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and
interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018,
or in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified
retrospective transition approach and provides certain optional transition
relief. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of this guidance
will have on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash
flows.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ),
which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU
2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at
an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to
customers. The original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the
Company to adopt beginning in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  
Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09
for one year and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date
of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its
first quarter of 2018 or 2019.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent
Considerations ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance for
principal versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10 ), which amends
the guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and
accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Company must adopt ASU
2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 with ASU 2014-09.The new revenue standard may be applied
retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the
cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is
currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the
new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements.

        RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS     
   Operating Leases    
 The Company leases its facility from a
shareholder under an operating lease agreement which expires on January 31,
2019. The monthly base rent is approximately $1,800. Rent expense under this
lease agreement amounted to approximately $15,570 and $16,021 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $5,300
and $5,241 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were
$107,486, as compared to $4,548 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This represents an increase of $102,938 or approximately 2263% compared to the
prior year period. The increase in net sales is primarily the result of an
increase in demand for the new models of laser marking machines.  
 Cost of sales increased by $60,608 or approximately 4076% to
$62,095 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,487 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, was $45,391, compared to $3,061 for the same period in
2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was approximately 42% in the
third quarter of 2016, compared to approximately 67% in the same period in 2015. The
change in gross profit percentage is due to that the sales in the third quarter
of 2015 consisted mostly parts sales which has higher margin.  
 10 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general
and administrative expenses totaled $138,140. This was a decrease of $5,998 or
approximately 4% as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease of
selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, is primarily the result of the decrease in insurance
expenses and travel expenses, partially offset by the increase in salary.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, loss from
operations was $(92,749) as compared to $(141,077) for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. This represents a decreased loss of $48,328 or approximately
34% comparing the two periods. The decrease of loss from operations for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily the result of an increase in
gross profit.  
 Other income (expenses) was $(7,612) and $(4,833) for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. This represents
decreased income of $2,779 or approximately 57.5% . The main reason for this
decreased other income was an increase in interest expense and a loss on foreign
currency exchange, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  
 Our net loss was $(90,432) for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $(145,910) for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decreased loss for the three months ended September 30,
2016, was due to the reasons described above. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were
$719,763, as compared to $10,334 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This represents an increase of $709,429 or approximately 6865% compared to the
prior year period. The increase in net sales is primarily the result of an
increase in demand for the new models of laser marking machines.  
 Cost of sales increased by $371,887 or approximately 9917% to
$375,637 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $3,750 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, was $344,126, compared to $6,584 for the same period in
2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was approximately 47.81% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 63.71 % in the
same period in 2015. The higher gross profit rate for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, was primarily due to the sales consisting of parts only,
compared to the sales of new models and parts in the same period in 2016.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general
and administrative expenses totaled $483,318. This was an increase of $20,462 or
approximately 4.4% as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the
increase in freight expenses and salary. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, loss from
operations decreased to $139,192 as compared to $456,272 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This represents a decreased loss of $317,080 or
approximately 69.5% comparing the two periods. The decrease of loss from
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily the result
of an increase in gross profit which is partially offset by an increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses.  
 Other income (expenses) was $(14,042) and $(7,334) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. This represents
decreased income of $6,708 or approximately 91.5% . The main reason for this increased other expenses was an increase in
interest expense, and the decrease in gain on foreign currency exchange and
interest income, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 11 

Our net loss was $(164,360) for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $(463,606) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The decreased loss for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, was due to the reasons described above. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Cash and cash equivalents were $28,447 at September 30, 2016,
and $74,982 at December 31, 2015. Our total current assets were $209,609 at
September 30, 2016, as compared to $225,730 at December 31, 2015. Our total
current liabilities were $335,692 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $492,708
at December 31, 2015. 
 We had a negative working capital at September 30, 2016, of
$(126,083) compared with a negative working capital of $(266,978) at December
31, 2015. This increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in
accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable, advance from customers,
and due to related parties, which is partial offset by decreases in cash and
cash equivalents, inventory, prepaid and other current assets and increases in
accrued expenses, and income tax payable.  
 Net cash flow used in operating activities during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, was $358,195, an increase of $95,398 compared
to $262,797 net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in the cash used in operating activities was
primarily due to decreased net loss, decreases in amortization and depreciation,
foreign currency exchange gain, inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts payable,
advance from customers, and due to related parties, and increases in accounts
receivable, accrued expenses, and allowance for inventory value decline.  
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, was $1,324, which was due to purchase of fixed assets.  
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, was $308,938, which was due to proceeds from advances
from related parties.  
 Net change in cash and cash equivalents was a decrease of
$46,535during the nine months ended September 31, 2016, and a decrease of 71,103
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

our operations and is not expected to have any material effect on our
operations.  
  Climate Change   
 Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental
regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any
material effect on our operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we
conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange

in the Commission's rules and forms.

factors that could affect these controls during our last fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  
  PART II   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  
 None.  
  Item 1A. Risk Factors.  
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide
this information; provided, however:  
   The market price of our common stock may limit its
eligibility for clearing house deposit.    
 We have been advised that if the market price for shares of our
common stock is less than $0.10 per share, The Depository Trust Company and
other securities clearing firms may decline to accept shares of our common stock
for deposit and refuse to clear trades. This would materially and adversely
affect the marketability and liquidity of our common stock, and, accordingly,
may materially and adversely affect the value of an investment in our common
stock.

and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
 a) designed such disclosure
controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be
designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this
report is being prepared;  
 b) designed such internal control
over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial

accounting principles;

change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's
fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting; and  
 5. The registrant's other
certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the
audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
equivalent functions):  
 a) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting, which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and  
 b) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
