SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ).  

The
Company has adopted its fiscal year-end to be December 31.  

Basis
of consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries and its VIEs in which the Company
is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

Use
of estimates   

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets,
and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Revenue
recognition   

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , the Company recognizes revenue from sales of goods when the following four
revenue criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) selling price is fixed
or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Revenue
from supplies of beauty products is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred and there are no continuing obligations
to the customer. Title and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to and accepted by the customer when the products are collected
by the customer at the Company s office. Revenue is recorded net of sales discounts, returns, allowances, and other adjustments
that are based upon management s best estimates and historical experience and are provided for in the same period as the
related revenues are recorded. Based on limited operating history, management estimates that there were no sales return for the
period reported.  

Cost
of revenue   

Cost
of revenue includes the purchase cost of retail goods for re-sale to customers and packing materials (such as boxes). It excludes
purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other costs of distribution network
in cost of revenues.  

Shipping
and handling fees   

Shipping
and handling fees, if billed to customers, are included in revenue. Shipping and handling fees associated with inbound and outbound
freight are expensed as incurred and included in selling and distribution expenses.  

Shipping
and handling fees are expensed as incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $732 and $2,736 respectively,
while for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $490 and $1,590 respectively.  

Selling
and distribution expenses   

Selling
and distribution expenses are primarily comprised of travelling and accommodation, transportation fees such as petrol, toll and
parking and shipping and handling fees.

   FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2016   

   (Currency
expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ), except for number of shares)   

   (UNAUDITED)   

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.  

Inventories   

Inventories
consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market
value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer
demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are
recorded in cost of revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

Property
and equipment    

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation of property, equipment and software
are calculated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or lease terms generally as follows:  

Classification   
           
       Estimated
    useful lives    
 
      Computer and software  
         
      5 years   
 
      Furniture and Fittings  
         
      5 years   
 
      Office equipment  
         
      10 years   
 
      Renovation  
         
      5 years   

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  

Intangible
assets   

Intangible
assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets represented the registration costs of trademarks in
Hong Kong, China, and Malaysia, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of five years.  

The
Company follows ASC Topic 350 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators
of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets 
carrying amounts. There were no impairment losses recorded on intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

Income
taxes   

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes   ( ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.  

DSWISS,
INC.   

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2016   

   (Currency
expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ), except for number of shares)   

   (UNAUDITED)   

The
Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and is expanding to China and Thailand. The Company is subject to
tax in these jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file tax returns that are subject
to examination by the foreign tax authority.  

Net
income/(loss) per share   

The
Company calculates net income/(loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share.   Basic
income/(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income/(loss) per share except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents
had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  

Foreign
currencies translation   

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars ( US$ ) and the accompanying financial statements have
been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company s subsidiaries and VIEs in Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and Thailand maintains
their books and record in their local currency, Ringgits Malaysia ( RM ), Hong Kong Dollars ( HK$ ), Chinese
Renminbi ( RMB ) and Thai Baht ( THB ) respectively, which is functional currency as being the primary
currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.  

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated
into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,   Translation of Financial Statement  , using the exchange rate
on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses
resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within the statements of stockholders  equity.  

Translation
of amounts from RM into US$1, HK$ into US$1, RMB into US$1 and THB into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for
the respective periods:  

Fair
value of financial instruments:   

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable and approximate at
their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2016   

   (Currency
expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ), except for number of shares)   

   (UNAUDITED)   

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC
820-10 ), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

Level
2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  

Level
3:  Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.  

Segment
reporting   

ASC
Topic 280,   Segment Reporting   establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on
a basis consistent with the Company s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business
segments and major customers in financial statements. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company operates in two
reportable operating segment in Malaysia and Hong Kong.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

FASB
issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June
10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10,  Development Stage
Entities  (Topic 915) - Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest
Entities Guidance in Topic 810,  Consolidation , which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely
from current accounting guidance. The Company has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs
and the requirement to disclose results of operations and cash flows since inception.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU
2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) ,
and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early
adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates
of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after January December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year
public entities) and interim periods therein. Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has
not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. We do not expect the adoption of this new standard
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which establishes management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and,
if so, to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term  substantial doubt 
and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be
issued. Management will also be required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The guidance is effective
for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. The Company

Company
Overview   

DSwiss,
Inc., a Nevada corporation ( the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 28, 2015.
DSwiss Holding Limited owns 100% of DSwiss (HK) Limited, a Hong Kong Company, which owns 100% of DSwiss Sdn Bhd, the operating
Malaysia Company of which is described below. In 2016, DSwiss (HK) Limited invested in DSwiss Biotech Sdn Bhd, incorporated in
Malaysia, and owned 40% equity interest. DSwiss (HK) Limited also invested in DS Asia Co., Ltd, incorporated in Thailand, and
owned 49% equity interest. We have incorporated a new company namely DSwiss International Trading (Shenzhen) Limited in China,
with 100% equity interest owned by DSwiss (HK) Limited.  

Our
Company is a beauty supply company formed with the goal of supplying high quality beauty products directly to our clients. Our
beauty supplies include, but are not limited to, beverages to assist in burning and reducing fat, anti-aging creams, and products
designed to improve the overall health and physical appearance of our clients. Currently we supply our products solely in Malaysia
and Hong Kong, however we have intentions to expand to Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Macau and China in the next year, and subsequent
to that we will make efforts to expand throughout the world.  

At
this time, we operate exclusively online through our website: http://www.dswissbeauty.com/.  

Our
company continuously strives to improve the already high standard of our goods and services through ongoing research and market
development. We are going to penetrate into South East Asia markets through the recruitment of distributors and via the social
media like Facebook and Instagram. We foresee to spend a substantial amount in marketing and advertising in the coming year. At
DSwiss we are determined to bring new products to markets that we have not yet explored.  

Products
which meet the definition of a medicinal scope need to be registered with the Drug Control Authority (DCA), Ministry of Health
Malaysia. Manufacturing, marketing, importation and the sale of unregistered products is a violation of the Drug Control Regulations
and Cosmetics Act 1984 of Malaysia and enforcement action can be taken.  

Among
the products offered by DSwiss,  Coffee Plus ,  Kiwi Cell Detox  and  Triple Stem Cell  are
not controlled by the DCA since the medicinal component of the products is no more than 20%.  

For
the remaining products offered by DSwiss,  Coffee Slimming Scrub ,  DSwiss EE Cream  and  DSwiss
New Age Essence  are classified as drug and cosmetic items and need to be registered with the DCA. These products have been
approved by DCA with a validity period for 2 years starting from end of December.  

We
always strive to offer products as high quality as possible, and hope that this assurance from an esteemed regulatory body will
also serve to prove our continuing commitment to providing quality goods.  

Our
expected growth is planned to occur primarily through the implementation of our social media marketing strategy. DSwiss already
has a strong relationship with social media (e.g. Facebook, Instagram and Wechat). The global presence social media has helped
provide to us has been an invaluable resource, and as we continue to expand our business operations and spread our brand awareness
we intend to primarily utilize social media to reach our customers. The benefits of social media are countless, but perhaps the
most imperative to our future success is our ability to connect with customers directly, to receive their feedback almost instantaneously.
On that note, the feedback we have received from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, which has helped us to create a
robust brand image.  

While
DSwiss has been focused almost exclusively upon pursuing operations within Asia, we do have plans to expand outward and become
a household name across the world. Our strategy to do so going forward is by forming partnerships with local companies in various
countries that may be willing to stock our products or promote them to their own customers. We believe that by forging strategic
relationships and partnerships we can expand our operations across the globe at a greater pace and with greater certainty than
we would if we tried to expand on our own.  

Results
of Operation    

For
the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we realized revenue in the amount of $20,978 and $116,847 respectively, while
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 we realized revenues in the amount of $16,748 and $92,093 respectively.
Our gross profits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $10,091 and $42,553 respectively, which is higher
than $(1,222) and $30,822 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. We attribute the increase in revenue
due to increase new customers and decrease of gross profit due to increase in purchase cost in 2016. We believe that in order
to retain and maintain more customers in the future we must increase our marketing efforts and or develop new products.  

*Our
gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some entities include all the costs related to their distribution
network in cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue includes only the purchase cost of products and packing materials, and does not
include any allocation of inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal
transfer costs, and the other costs associated with the distribution network.  

Our
net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $147,835 and $344,918 respectively, while for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $49,630 and $95,467 respectively. We attribute this decrease due to additional cost
incurred to increase product sales and develop new market share.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 our assets total $610,279 due to increases in cash and cash equivalents. Besides the
increase in sales over the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the sale of convertible notes to accredited investors attributed
to this cash increase via cash infusions. The accredited investors who provided these cash infusions are not our officers or directors,
nor are they affiliates of the Company.  

The
introduction of Malaysia Goods   Services Tax (GST) is still has effect on the selling price and hence the revenue. Malaysia
Goods   Services Tax of 6% was implemented on April 1, 2015. It causes the imposed GST tax on the selling price of products
offered by the Company.  

The cost of sales also increased because of the increase in revenue.   

The
increases in general and administrative expenses are results of advertising   promotion, cost on new company formation, listing
cost on the OTC market and compliance costs as a public company.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $500,597. We have negative operating cash flows
and our working capital has been and will continue to be significant. As a result, we depend substantially on financing activities
to provide us with the liquidity and capital resources we need to meet our working capital requirements and to make capital investments
in connection with ongoing operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we have meet these requirements primarily
by issuance of our convertible promissory notes. The Company expects its current capital resources to meet our basic operating
requirements for approximately twelve months.  

Operating
Activities    

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $371,940, compared to net cash used
of $64,901 in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects the increase in net loss due to increase
in general and administrative expenses for new company formation and preparation costs for listing on the OTC, the increase in
inventories and the decrease in other payables and accrued liabilities.  

Investing
Activities    

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $25,600, reflecting the purchase of
property and equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $2,527, reflecting
the purchase of trademark.  

Financing
Activities    

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $473,359 sourced from proceeds of convertible
notes payable and advances from directors.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued several convertible promissory notes (collectively the  Convertible
Notes ) to 60 accredited investors in an aggregated principal amount of $396,900. The Convertible Notes bear no interest
with a maturity of two years, due in 2017   2018. The principal is payable in a lump sum at maturity. The conversion price
of thirty-two notes is $0.2 per share, while the conversion price of remaining notes is $0.4 per share. The notes are convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock either 1) at the option of the holders, or 2) upon a Qualified Financing of the
Company. The details are summarized as follows:  

In
the event that the Company issues and sells shares of its Equity Securities to investors (the  Investors ) on or before
the date of the prepayment in full of this Note via equity financing resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $800,000
(including the conversion of the Notes and other debt) (a  Qualified Financing ), then the unpaid principal balance
of this Note shall automatically convert in whole without any further action by the Holder into such Equity Securities. The IPO
offering will trigger automatic conversion of the Convertible Notes if the Company sells more than $800,000 of equity.  

In
regards to all of the above transactions we claim an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation
S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Regulation S ) for the above sales of the Convertible Notes since the
sales of the Convertible Notes were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant
to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of
their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.  

Capital
Expenditures    

Our
capital expenditures primarily relate to the acquisition of property and equipment. Our capital expenditures for the nine months
periods ended September 30, 2016 was $25,600.  

Credit
Facilities    

We
do not have any credit facilities or other access to bank credit.  

Contractual
Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies   

We
currently have a lease agreement in place with respect to office premises in Malaysia to commence our business operations.  

For
the period from November 2015 to September 30, 2016, the Company issued several convertible promissory notes (collectively the
 Convertible Notes ) to 85 accredited investors in an aggregated principal amount of $638,400. The Convertible Notes
bear no interest with a maturity of two years, due in 2017   2018. The principal is payable in a lump sum at maturity. The
conversion price of two notes is $0.1 per share, the conversion price of fifty five notes is $0.2 per share, and the conversion
price of twenty eight notes is $0.4. The notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock either 1) at the
option of the holders, or 2) upon a Qualified Financing of the Company. The details are summarized as follows:  

In
the event that the Company issues and sells shares of its Equity Securities to investors (the  Investors ) on or before
the date of the prepayment in full of this Note in an equity financing resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least
$800,000 (including the conversion of the Notes and other debt) (a  Qualified Financing ), then the unpaid principal
balance of this Note shall automatically convert in whole without any further action by the Holder into such Equity Securities.
This offering will trigger automatic conversion of the Convertible Notes if the Company sells more than $800,000 of equity.  

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to our stockholders as of September 30, 2016.

On
June 27, 2016, DSwiss (HK) Limited ( DSHK ) entered into a Management Services Agreement (the  Management Services
Agreement I ) which entitles DSHK to substantially entitled to all of the economic benefits of DSwiss Biotech Sdn Bhd ( DSBT )
in consideration of services provided by DSHK to DSBT. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement I, DSHK has the exclusive
right to provide to DSBT management, financial and other services related to the operation of DSBT s business, and DSBT
is required to take all commercially reasonable efforts to permit and facilitate the provision of the services provided by DSHK.
As compensation for providing the services, DSHK is entitled to receive a fee from DSBT, upon demand, equal to 100% of the annual
net profits of DSBT during the term of the Management Services Agreement I. DSHK may also request ad hoc quarterly payments of
the aggregate fee, which payments will be credited against DSBT s future payment obligations.  

The
Management Services Agreement I also provides DSHK, or its designee, with a right of first refusal to acquire all or any portion
of the equity of DSBT upon any proposal by the sole shareholder of DSBT to transfer such equity. In addition, at the sole discretion
of DSHK, DSBT is obligated to transfer to DSHK, or its designee, any part or all of the business, personnel, assets and operations
of DSBT which may be lawfully conducted, employed, owned or operated by DSHK, including:  

(a)
business opportunities presented to, or available to DSBT may be pursued and contracted for in the name of DSHK rather than DSBT,
and at its discretion, DSHK may employ the resources of DSBT to secure such opportunities;  

(b)
any tangible or intangible property of DSBT, any contractual rights, any personnel, and any other items or things of value held
by DSBT may be transferred to DSHK at book value;

of the business may be obtained by DSHK by acquisition, lease, license or otherwise, and made available to DSBT on terms to be
determined by agreement between DSHK and DSBT;  

(d)
contracts entered into in the name of DSBT may be transferred to DSHK, or the work under such contracts may be subcontracted,
in whole or in part, to DSHK, on terms to be determined by agreement between DSHK and DSBT; and  

(e)
any changes to, or any expansion or contraction of, the business may be carried out in the exercise of the sole discretion of
DSHK, and in the name of and at the expense of, DSHK; provided, however, that none of the foregoing may cause or have the effect
of terminating (without being substantially replaced under the name of DSHK) or adversely affecting any license, permit or regulatory
status of DSBT.  

In
addition, DSHK entered into certain agreements with Jervey Choon, (the  DSBT shareholder ), including  

(i)  
      a
    Call Option Agreement allowing DSHK to acquire the shares of DSBT as permitted by Malaysia laws;   

(ii)  
      a
    Shareholders  Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides DSHK with the voting rights of the DSBT; and    

(iii)  
      an
    Equity Pledge Agreement that pledges the shares in DSBT.    

This

Inc, with control over the operations and benefits of DSBT without having a direct equity ownership in DSBT.  

On
June 27, 2016, DSHK also entered into a Management Services Agreement (the  Management Services Agreement II ) which
entitles DSHK to substantially entitled to all of the economic benefits of DS Asia Co., Ltd ( DSAC ) in consideration
of services provided by DSHK to DSAC. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement II, DSHK has the exclusive right to provide
to DSAC management, financial and other services related to the operation of DSAC s business, and DSAC is required to take
all commercially reasonable efforts to permit and facilitate the provision of the services provided by DSHK. As compensation for
providing the services, DSHK is entitled to receive a fee from DSAC, upon demand, equal to 100% of the annual net profits of DSAC
during the term of the Management Services Agreement II. DSHK may also request ad hoc quarterly payments of the aggregate fee,
which payments will be credited against DSAC s future payment obligations.  

The
Management Services Agreement II also provides DSHK, or its designee, with a right of first refusal to acquire all or any portion
of the equity of DSAC upon any proposal by the sole shareholder of DSAC to transfer such equity. In addition, at the sole discretion
of DSHK, DSAC is obligated to transfer to DSHK, or its designee, any part or all of the business, personnel, assets and operations
of DSAC which may be lawfully conducted, employed, owned or operated by DSHK, including:

and at its discretion, DSHK may employ the resources of DSAC to secure such opportunities;  

(b)
any tangible or intangible property of DSAC, any contractual rights, any personnel, and any other items or things of value held
by DSAC may be transferred to DSHK at book value;

in whole or in part, to DSHK, on terms to be determined by agreement between DSHK and DSAC; and  

(e)
any changes to, or any expansion or contraction of, the business may be carried out in the exercise of the sole discretion of
DSHK, and in the name of and at the expense of, DSHK; provided, however, that none of the foregoing may cause or have the effect
of terminating (without being substantially replaced under the name of DSHK) or adversely affecting any license, permit or regulatory
status of DSAC.  

In
addition, DSHK entered into certain agreements with each of Ms. Wereya Limpasuthum, Ms. Kanittha Tharanut, (collectively, the
 DSAC shareholders ), including

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4 Controls and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:     

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management
to conclude that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation
of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:     

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending September 30, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings    

We
know of no materials, active or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceedings
or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any beneficial shareholder
are an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to us.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide
the information under this item.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    

For
the period from November 2015 to September 30, 2016, the Company issued several convertible promissory notes (collectively the
 Convertible Notes ) to 79 accredited investors in an aggregated principal amount of $638,400. The Convertible Notes
bear no interest with a maturity of two years, due in 2017   2018. The principal is payable in a lump sum at maturity. The
conversion price of two notes is $0.1 per share, the conversion price of fifty five notes is $0.2 per share, and the conversion
price of twenty eight notes is $0.4. The notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock either 1) at the
option of the holders, or 2) upon a Qualified Financing of the Company. The details are summarized as follows:  

In
regards to all of the above transactions we claim an exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation
S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ( Regulation S ) for the above sales of the Convertible Notes since the
sales of the Convertible Notes were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant
to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of
their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.
