NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(unaudited)

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

BioSig Technologies Inc. (the  Company ) was initially incorporated on February 24, 2009 under the laws of the State of Nevada and subsequently re-incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2011. The Company is principally devoted to improving the quality of cardiac recordings obtained during EP studies and catheter ablation procedures. The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.

The unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

The condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements.

Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Company s Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2016.

NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S LIQUIDITY PLANS

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $150,454 and working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $3,098,462 principally due to the inclusion of non-cash derivative and warrant liabilities recorded in current liabilities. In addition, the Company raised approximately $450,000 in October 2016 through the sale of common stock and warrants (See Note 11). As of September 30, 2016, excluding the derivative and warrant liabilities, the Company's working capital deficit would have been $482,916. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used net cash in operating activities of $3,844,553.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company has sufficient funds to meet its research and development and other funding requirements for at least the next 2 months.

The Company's primary source of operating funds since inception has been cash proceeds from private placements of common and preferred stock. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company has stockholders' deficiencies at September 30, 2016 and requires additional financing to fund future operations. Further, the Company does not have any commercial products available for sale and there is no assurance that if approval of their products is received that the Company will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable.

Accordingly, the accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the Company s stock, stock-based compensation, fair values relating to warrant and other derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ) requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820-10 ) and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.

Derivative Instrument Liability

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding preferred stock and warrants that contained embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives include certain conversion features and reset provisions. (See Note 6 and Note 7).

Research and development costs

The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ( ASC 730-10 ). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $560,514 and $2,139,671 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016; and $354,471 and $1,146,113 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

The Company computes earnings (loss) per share under Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260-10 ). Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the  treasury stock  and/or  if converted  methods as applicable.

The computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period. The Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss.

Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:

Stock Based Compensation

The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 8,090,190 options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock, of which 6,745,099 were vested.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 7,780,190 options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock, of which 5,613,501 were vested.

Income Taxes

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes ( ASC 740-10 ) for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.

(unaudited)

Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate.  Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and are considered immaterial.

Registration Rights

The Company accounts for registration rights agreements in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-20, Registration Payment Arraignments ( ASC 825-20 ). Under ASC 825-20, the Company is required to disclose the nature and terms of the arraignment, the maximum potential amount and to assess each reporting period the probable liability under these arraignments and, if exists, to record or adjust the liability to current period operations.  On June 23, 2014, the Company filed Form S-1/A became effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  As such, the Company determined that payments were due under its registration rights agreement and therefore accrued $55,620 as interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 for the liability under the registration rights agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the liability at $-0- and therefore recorded the change to current period operations.

Beginning on October 23, 2015, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain accredited investors pursuant to which the Company sold to the investors units, which each unit consisting of one share of the Company s common stock and a warrant to purchase one half of one share of common stock (the   Private Placement  ).  In connection with the Private Placement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreements with the investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide certain registration rights with respect to the common stock and warrants issued under the Private Placement.  The registration rights agreements require the Company to file a registration statement within 45 calendar days upon the final closing under the Private Placement and to be effective 120 calendar days thereafter. The final closing under the Private Placement occurred on April 29, 2016. On August 2, 2016, the Company filed Form S-1 registration statement which became effective August 9, 2016. The Company has estimated the liability under the registration rights agreement at $-0- as of September 30, 2016.

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods  data to conform with the current year s presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income or losses.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Subsequent Events

The Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued.  Based upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed.

NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows:

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 5 years. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings.

Depreciation expense was $2,570 and $7,811 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; and $2,607 and $7,948 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

NOTE 5   ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accounts payable and accrued expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:

NOTE 6   SERIES C 9% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

On January 9, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to 4,200 shares of 9% Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series C Preferred Stock ).

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)

The Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to preference over holders of junior stock upon liquidation in the amount of $1,000 plus any accrued and unpaid dividends; entitled to dividends as a preference to holders of junior stock at a rate of 9% per annum of the stated value of $1,000 per share, payable quarterly beginning on September 30, 2013 and are cumulative.  The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock vote together with the holders of our common stock on an as-converted basis, but may not vote the Series C Preferred Stock in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation of the Series C Preferred Stock.  The beneficial ownership limitation is 4.99% of our then outstanding shares of common stock following such conversion or exercise, which may be increased to up to 9.99% of our then outstanding shares of common stock following such conversion or exercise upon the request of an individual holder.  The beneficial ownership limitation is determined on an individual holder basis, such that the as-converted number of shares of one holder is not included in the shares outstanding when calculating the limitation for a different holder.

In addition, absent the approval of holders representing at least 67% of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, we may not (i) increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock, (ii) amend our charter documents, including the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, in any manner adverse to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, including authorizing or creating any class of stock ranking senior to, or otherwise pari passu with, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption or distribution of assets upon a liquidation, or (iii) perform certain covenants, including:

incur additional indebtedness;

permit liens on assets;

repay, repurchase or otherwise acquire more than a de minimis number of shares of capital stock;

pay cash dividends to our stockholders; and

engage in transactions with affiliates.

Any holder of Series C Preferred Stock is entitled at any time to convert any whole or partial number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at a price of $1.50 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock is subject to full ratchet anti-dilution price protection upon the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities at an effective common stock purchase price of less than $1.50 per share as well as other customary anti-dilution protection.

In the event that:

(i)  

we fail to, or announce our intention not to, deliver common stock share certificates upon conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock prior to the seventh trading day after such shares are required to be delivered,

(ii)  

we fail for any reason to pay in full the amount of cash due pursuant to our failure to deliver common stock share certificates upon conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock within five calendar days after notice therefor is delivered,

(iii)  

we fail to have available a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stock to issue upon a conversion of our Series C Preferred Stock,

(iv)  

we fail to observe or perform any other covenant, agreement or warranty contained in, or otherwise commit any breach of our obligations under, the securities purchase agreement, the registration rights agreement, the certificate of designation or the warrants entered into pursuant to the private placement transaction for our Series C Preferred Stock, which failure or breach could have a material adverse effect, and such failure or breach is not cured within 30 calendar days after written notice was delivered,

(v)  

we are party to a change of control transaction,

(vi)  

we file for bankruptcy or a similar arrangement or are adjudicated insolvent,

(vii)  

we are subject to a judgment, including an arbitration award against us, of greater than $100,000, and such judgment remains unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of 45 calendar days,

The holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled, among other rights, to redeem their shares of Series C Preferred Stock at any time for greater than their stated value or increase the dividend rate on their shares of Series C Preferred Stock to 18%.   The Company determined that certain of the defined triggering events were outside the Company s control and therefore classified the Series C Preferred Stock outside of equity.

In connection with the sale of the Series C preferred stock, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,330,627 warrants to purchase the Company s common stock at $2.61 per share expiring five years from the initial exercise date.  The warrants contain full ratchet anti-dilution price protection upon the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities at an effective common stock purchase price of less than $2.61 per share as well as other customary anti-dilution protection. The warrants are exercisable for cash; or if at any time after six months from the issuance date, there is no effective registration statement registering the resale, or no current prospectus available for the resale, of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, the warrants may be exercised by means of a  cashless exercise . 

As a result of an amendment to the conversion price of our Series C Preferred Stock, the full-ratchet anti-dilution protection provision of the warrants decreased the exercise price of the warrants from $2.61 per share to $1.50 per share and increased the aggregate number of shares issuable under the warrants to 2,315,301.

In accordance with ASC 470-20, at issuance, the Company recognized an embedded beneficial conversion feature present in the Series C Preferred Stock when it was issued. The Company allocated the net proceeds between the intrinsic value of the conversion option ($1,303,671) and the warrants ($1,064,739) to additional paid-in capital.  The aggregate debt discount, comprised of the relative intrinsic value of the conversion option ($1,303,671), the relative fair value of the warrants ($1,064,739), and the issuance costs ($412,590), for a total of $2,781,000, is amortized over an estimated one year as interest expense.

During the month of February 2013, the holders of previously issued convertible bridge notes converted into 600 shares of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock.

During the months of February, March, May, and July 2013, the Company sold an aggregate of 2,181 shares of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $1,814,910.

At the time of issuance and until March 31, 2015, the Company determined that the anti-dilutive provisions embedded in the Series C Preferred Stock and related issued warrants did not meet the defined criteria of a derivative in such that the net settlement requirement of delivery of common shares does not meet the  readily convertible to cash  as described in Accounting Standards Codification 815 and therefore bifurcation is not required.  There was no established market for the Company s common stock.  As described in Note 7, as of March 31, 2015, the Company determined a market had been established for the Company s common stock and accordingly, reclassified the fair value of the embedded reset provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock and warrants of $1,242,590 and $4,097,444, respectively, from equity to liabilities.

At March 31, 2015, the Company valued the reset provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock and warrants in accordance with ASC 470-20 using the Multinomial Lattice pricing model and the following assumptions: contractual terms of 2.78 to 3.50 years, a risk free interest rate of 0.56% to 0.89%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility of 141.00%.

In February 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 54,859 shares of its common stock in exchange for 75 shares of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock and accrued dividends.

NOTE 9   OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND WARRANTS

Options

On October 19, 2012, the Company s Board of Directors approved the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan ( the  Plan) and terminated the Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ). The Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 11,686,123 (as amended) shares of the Company s common stock to officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company (as amended). Under the terms of the Plan the Company may issue Incentive Stock Options as defined by the Internal Revenue Code to employees of the Company only and nonstatutory options. The Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof administers the Plan and determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the grants under the Plan.

However, the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option should not be less than 110% of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10% or more stockholder and 100% of fair value for a grantee who is not 10% stockholder. The fair value of the common stock is determined based on the quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the administrator in good faith.

Additionally, the vesting period of the grants under the Plan will be determined by the administrator, in its sole discretion, with an expiration period of not more than ten years. The Company reserved 227,388 shares of its common stock for future issuance under the terms of the Plan.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of 750,000, net of 100,000 canceled, options to officers, directors and key consultants.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of 873,545 stock grants to officers, employees and key consultants under the plan. See Note 8.

The following table presents information related to stock options at September 30, 2016:

A summary of the stock option activity and related information for the Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding tables represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on options with an exercise price less than the Company s stock price of $1.52 as of September 30, 2016, which would have been received by the option holders had those option holders exercised their options as of that date.

Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. The fair value of stock-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option model with a volatility figure derived from using the Company s historical stock prices for 2016. Prior to 2016, the Company derived the volatility figure from an index of historical stock prices for comparable entities. Management determined this assumption to be a more accurate indicator of value. The Company accounts for the expected life of options based on the contractual life of options for non-employees. For employees, the Company accounts for the expected life of options in accordance with the  simplified  method, which is used for  plain-vanilla  options, as defined in the accounting standards codification.

The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining life consistent with the expected term of the options. 

In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. In estimating the Company s forfeiture rate, the Company analyzed its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options, and the number of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the Company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.

The Company estimated forfeitures related to option grants at a weighted average annual rate of  0% per year, as the Company does not yet have adequate historical data, for options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

The following assumptions were used in determining the fair value of employee and vesting non-employee options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

NOTE 10   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825-10 ). ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

21 

Table of Contents 

BIOSIG TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(unaudited)

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3   Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.

All items required to be recorded or measured on a recurring basis are based upon level 3 inputs.

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Upon adoption of ASC 825-10, there was no cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings and no impact on the financial statements.

The carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any items that would be classified as level 1 or 2 disclosures.

The Company recognizes its derivative and warrant liabilities as level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed in Note 7. While the Company believes that its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed in Note 5 are that of volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.

The derivative and warrant liability as of September 30, 2016, in the amount of $291,086 and $2,324,460, respectively, has a level 3 classification.

The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s level 3 financial liabilities as of September 30, 2016:

Fluctuations in the Company s stock price are a primary driver for the changes in the derivative valuations during each reporting period. As the stock price increases for each of the related derivative instruments, the value to the holder of the instrument generally increases, therefore increasing the liability on the Company s balance sheet. Additionally, stock price volatility is one of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of each of the Company s derivative instruments.

Business Overview

We are a development stage medical device company that is developing a proprietary technology platform to minimize noise and artifacts from cardiac recordings during electrophysiology studies and ablation.  We are developing the PURE (Precise Uninterrupted Real-time evaluation of Electrograms) EP System, a surface electrocardiogram and intracardiac multichannel recording and analysis system that acquires, processes and displays electrocardiogram and electrograms required during electrophysiology studies and ablation procedures.

The PURE EP System is designed to assist electrophysiologists in making clinical decisions in real-time by providing information that, we believe, is not always easily obtained, if at all, from any other equipment presently used in electrophysiology labs.  The PURE EP System s ability to acquire high fidelity cardiac signals will potentially increase these signals  diagnostic value, and therefore offer improved accuracy and efficiency of the EP studies and related procedures.  We are developing signal processing tools within the PURE EP System. We believe that these will assist electrophysiologists in further differentiating true signals from noise, and will provide guidance in identifying ablation targets.

Since June 2011, we have collaborated with physicians affiliated with the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David s Medical Center in Austin, Texas for initial technology validation.  The physicians affiliated with the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute have provided us with digital recordings obtained with conventional electrophysiology recording systems during different stages of electrophysiology studies.  Using our proprietary signal processing tools that are part of the PURE EP System, we analyzed these recordings and successfully removed baseline wander, noise and artifacts from the data thereby providing better diagnostic quality signals.

We are focused on improving the quality of cardiac recordings obtained during ablation of atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and ventricular tachycardia, an arrhythmia evidenced by a fast heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers of the heart, which can be life-threatening. Cardiac ablation is a procedure that corrects conduction of electrical impulses in the heart that cause arrhythmias.  During this invasive procedure, a catheter is usually inserted using a venous access into a specific area of the heart. A special radiofrequency generator delivers energy through the catheter to small areas of the heart muscle that cause the abnormal heart rhythm.

According to a 2009 article in  Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology , ablation is superior to pharmacological treatments and is becoming a first line of therapy for certain patients with arrhythmias ( Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation With Antiarrhythmic Drugs or Radiofrequency Ablation,   Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology  (2009) 2: 349-361).

Our overall goal is to establish our proprietary technology as a new platform that will have the following advantages over the electrophysiology recording systems currently available on the market:

Higher quality cardiac signal acquisition for accurate and more efficient electrophysiology studies;

Precise, uninterrupted, real time evaluations of electrograms;

Reliable cardiac recordings to better determine precise ablation targets, strategy and end point of procedures; and

A portable device that can be fully integrated into existing electrophysiology lab environments.

If we are able to develop our product as designed, we believe that the PURE EP System and its signal processing tools will contribute to an increase in the number of procedures performed in each electrophysiology lab and possibly improved patient outcomes.

Our significant scientific achievements to date include:

Initial system concept validation has been performed in collaboration with physicians at the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David s Medical Center in Austin, Texas in June 2011.  The Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute provided challenging recordings obtained with electrophysiology recording systems presently in use at the institute during various electrophysiology studies. Our technology team successfully imported the data into the PURE EP System software and using proprietary signal processing, the PURE EP System software was able to reduce baseline wander, noise, and artifacts from the data and therefore provide better diagnostic quality signals.

We have established clinical and/or advisory relationships for both technology development and validation studies with physicians and researchers affiliated with the following medical centers: Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, Austin, TX; Cardiac Arrhythmia Center at the University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY; Beaumont Medical Center, Detroit, MI; University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; The Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK; and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

The Cardiac Arrhythmia Center at the University of California at Los Angeles and Dr. Kalyanam Shivkumar, a former member of our board of directors, have played a significant role in the initial functional testing of our hardware.  Dr. Shivkumar and his team have enabled us to learn the connectivity of the lab and its devices that pertain to where our PURE EP System will fit in. In June 2013, we commenced our first proof of concept pre-clinical study with the assistance of Dr. Shivkumar in order to further test the components of the PURE EP System hardware, as further explained below.

We are developing signal processing tools within the PURE EP System that will assist electrophysiologists in further differentiating true signals from noise, which may potentially provide guidance in identifying ablation targets.  The signal processing tools are expected to be an integral part of the software of the PURE EP System, which we believe will significantly facilitate the locating of ablation targets.

In the second and third quarters of 2013, we performed and finalized testing of our proof of concept unit by initially using an electrocardiogram/intracardiac simulator at our lab, and subsequently by obtaining pre-clinical recordings from the lab at the University of California at Los Angeles.  As part of the testing, we simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals on our proof of concept unit and GE s CardioLab recording system. An identical signal was applied to the input of both systems and the monitor of our proof of concept unit was positioned next to the monitor of GE s CardioLab recording system to allow for visual comparison. We believe that our proof of concept unit performed well as compared to GE s CardioLab recording system, in that the electrocardiogram and intracardiac signals displayed on our proof of concept unit showed less baseline wander, noise and artifacts compared to signals displayed on GE s CardioLab recording system.  However, because this was a proof of concept test, without any clearly established protocols, we cannot present this data for publication and we do not have any independent verification or peer review of these findings.

In the third quarter of 2013, we analyzed the results of our proof of concept unit to determine the final design of the PURE EP System prototype, which has since been completed.  

In September 2014, we performed additional tests on the PURE EP System prototype at the University of California at Los Angeles.  

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we appointed Dr. Samuel J. Asirvatham from the Mayo Clinic as a member of our Scientific Advisory Board and initiated plans for pre-clinical studies at the Mayo Clinic.

In the first quarter of 2015, we appointed Dr. K. L. Venkatachalam from the Mayo Clinic as a member of our Scientific Advisory Board.  On March 31, 2015 Drs. Asirvatham and Venkatachalam performed our first pre-clinical study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

On June 10, 2015, Dr. Asirvatham performed our second pre-clinical study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

On November 17, 2015, Dr. Asirvatham performed our third pre-clinical study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

On February 22, 2016, we signed an agreement to initiate development of its PURE EP System with Minnetronix and are taking steps toward its 510(k) submission.

On June 2, 2016, Dr. Asirvatham performed our fourth pre-clinical study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota which launched the Advanced Research Program.

On June 23, 2016, Dr. Vivek Reddy performed an initial pre-clinical study at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, New York.

We conducted our first, second, and third pre-clinical studies on March 31, 2015, June 10, 2015 and November 17, 2015 respectively, and conducted our fourth pre-clinical study on June 2, 2016, which began an advanced research program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota with the PURE EP System prototype. Additionally, we conducted an initial pre-clinical study at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, New York on June 23, 2016. We also intend to conduct a pre-clinical study at the Cardiac Arrhythmia Center at the University of California at Los Angeles with emphasis on the ventricular tachycardia (VT) model. We intend to conduct further pre-clinical studies, end-user preference studies, and research studies. The main objective of these studies is to demonstrate the clinical potential of the PURE EP System. We have initiated technology development with Minnetronix, a medical technology and innovation company, and are implementing steps for obtaining 510(k) approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the PURE EP System.

We believe that by the first half of 2017, we will have obtained 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA and will be able to commence marketing and commercialization of the PURE EP System.  Our ability to achieve the aforementioned milestones will be principally determined by our ability to obtain necessary financing and regulatory approvals, among other factors.

Because we are a development stage company, with our initial product under development, we currently do not have any customers.  We anticipate that our initial customers will be hospitals and other health care facilities that operate electrophysiology labs.

Results of Operations

We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions. Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $3,098,462, comprised of cash of $150,454 and prepaid expenses of $134,530, which was offset by $426,497 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued dividends on preferred stock issuances of $341,403 and an aggregate of $2,615,546 of warrant and derivative liabilities. Excluding the warrant and derivative liabilities, the Company s working capital deficit would have been $482,916.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $3,844,553 of cash in operating activities and $12,095 of cash in investing activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $3,053,868, comprised of proceeds from the sale of our common stock. In the comparable period in 2015, our aggregate cash provided by financing activities totaled $3,538,094 comprised of $3,042,213 raised through the sale of our common stock, $450,000 from the sale of our Series C Preferred stock and $45,881 received from the exercise of common stock options and warrants. At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $150,454 compared to $953,234 at December 31, 2015. Our cash is held in bank deposit accounts. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no convertible debentures outstanding.

Cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,844,553 and $3,431,733, respectively, which represent cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods. The increase in cash outlays principally resulted from additional in operating costs and general and administrative expenses net with an increase of our outstanding accounts payable by $202,534.

We used $12,095 cash for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11,583 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we purchased office furniture and computer equipment of $12,095 and $8,971, respectively.  Additionally, in 2015, we paid a long term deposit of $2,612 for our corporate facility in Minneapolis.

In their report dated March 14, 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm stated at December 31, 2015, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised due to our net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and our expectation that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we will require additional financing to fund future operations.

Further, we do not have any commercial products available for sale and have not generated revenues to date, and there is no assurance that, if approval of our products is received, we will be able to generate cash flow to fund operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, obtaining loans from various financial institutions or being awarded grants from government agencies, where possible. Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.

We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to clinical trials. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.

Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. We believe our existing cash will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements. We anticipate we will need approximately $2 million in addition to our current cash on hand to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for the next 12 months.

We will have to raise additional funds to continue our operations and, while we have been successful in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary additional funds to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations.

Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, existing holders of our securities may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our securities.

If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Transactions with Related Parties

The Company s President and shareholders have advanced funds to the Company for working capital purposes since the Company s inception in February 2009.  No formal repayment terms or arrangements exist and the Company is not accruing interest on these advances. The net amount of outstanding advances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $-0-.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had reimbursable travel and other related expenses due related parties of $8,703 and $12,716, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Research and Development .

We account for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ( ASC 730-10 ). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred.

Stock Based Compensation .

All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period. Restricted stock payments and stock-based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance.

Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.

On October 29, 2014, our common stock commenced trading on OTCQB under the symbol  BSGM.   Fair value is typically determined by the closing price of our common stock on the date of the award.

Income Taxes .

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. We record an estimated valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

Derivative and Warrant Liabilities.

We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Not required under Regulation S-K for  smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
