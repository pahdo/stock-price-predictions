  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Note 1.     
       Business Organization and Pur   pose   

SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. ( SCI ,
or the  Company ), formerly Superconductive Components, Inc., an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1987. 
The Company operates in one segment as a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for Physical Vapor Deposition ( PVD )
Thin Film Applications.  The Company is focused on specific markets within the PVD industry (Photonics, Thin Film Solar, Glass,
Thin Film Battery and Transparent Electronics).  Substantially all of the Company s revenues were generated from customers
with multi-national operations.  Through collaboration with end users and Original Equipment Manufacturers the Company develops
innovative customized solutions enabling commercial success. 

Note 2.    
      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

The accompanying unaudited financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented have been included.
The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year
ended December 31, 2015. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Note 3.    
      Common Stock and Stock Options   

Stock Based
Compensation - Compensation cost for all stock awards is based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the required service
(vesting) period. Non cash stock based compensation expense was $52,972 and $56,332 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Non cash stock based compensation expense was $158,075 and $161,456 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense was $229,287 as of September 30, 2016 and will be recognized
through 2019. There was no tax benefit recorded for this compensation cost as the expense primarily relates to incentive stock
options that do not qualify for a tax deduction until, and only if, a qualifying disposition occurs. 

The non-employee board members received
compensation of 47,536 and 35,920 aggregate shares of common stock of the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The stock had an aggregate value of $36,957 and $40,338 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and was recorded as non-cash stock compensation expense in the financial statements. 

During 2016, proceeds of $4,200 were
received from the exercise of 5,000 stock options.

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Note 5.    
      Inventories   

The increase in
finished goods was due to a customer s request to delay shipment of an order that was scheduled to ship during September
2016. 

Note 6.    
      Earnings Per Share   

Basic income per share is calculated
as income applicable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated as diluted income applicable to common shareholders divided by the diluted weighted average number of common
shares. Diluted weighted average number of common shares gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. Diluted earnings per
share exclude all diluted potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, all convertible preferred stock and common stock options listed in Note 3 that were out-of-the-money or anti-dilutive
were excluded from diluted earnings per share. The following is provided to reconcile the earnings per share calculations:

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Note 7.   
     Notes Payable  

On August 8, 2013, the Company issued
a Promissory Note (the  Note ) in the amount of $128,257 to The Huntington National Bank, as Lender, with a maturity
date of August 5, 2016. This Note replaced an existing promissory note to The Huntington National Bank. 

The Note was collateralized by a
blanket lien on all of the Company s assets including, without limitation, inventory, equipment and accounts receivable.
Among other items, the Note provided for the following: 

-  Interest subject to change from time to time based on changes
in LIBOR. The interest rate applied to the unpaid principal balance was at a rate of 4 percentage points over LIBOR. Under no
circumstance was the interest rate to be less than 5% per annum or more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. 

The interest rate on the Note was
5% at December 31, 2015. The remaining outstanding balance of $19,047 was paid during April 2016. 

During 2010, the Company applied
and was approved for a 166 Direct Loan to borrow up to $744,250 with the Ohio Department of Development (ODOD), now known as the
Ohio Development Services Agency (ODSA). This loan was finalized in February 2011. The term of the loan is 84 months at a fixed
interest rate of 3%. There is also a 0.25% annual servicing fee charged monthly on the outstanding principal balance. On August
13, 2013, ODSA and the Company agreed to a modification to the payment schedule. Interest and servicing payments of $1,656 were
paid monthly from August 2013 through January 2014. Currently, monthly payments of approximately $10,400, including principal,
interest and servicing fee are due through October 2018. A final payment of approximately $71,900 is due November 2018. The loan
is collateralized by the related project equipment. As of September 30, 2016 there was an outstanding balance of $317,969 on this
loan. Debt issuance costs of $5,110 are netted against this amount for presentation in the financial statements. This loan is also
subject to certain covenants, including job creation and retention. On July 21, 2014, the Company and ODSA signed a second amendment
relating to the job creation and retention. The Company expects to maintain compliance with all covenants of this loan through
at least September 30, 2017. 

During 2010, the Company also applied
and was approved for a 166 Direct Loan through the Advanced Energy Program with the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority (OAQDA)
to borrow up to approximately $1.4 million (this maximum commitment by the OAQDA was subsequently reduced to $368,906 on March
20, 2012). On December 20, 2013, OAQDA and the Company signed a Fourth Amendment to the Loan Documents and agreed to a modification
to the payment schedule. Interest and servicing payments of $2,121 were payable quarterly from October 2013 through March 2014.
Beginning in June 2014, quarterly payments of approximately $17,300, including principal, interest at 3% and servicing fees are
due through December 2017. A final payment of approximately $50,400 is due February 2018. This loan is also subject to certain
covenants, including job creation. Included in the above amendment is a waiver for the job creation commitment, due to market conditions,
for the duration of the term of the Loan Agreement. On July 21, 2016, OAQDA and the Company signed a Fifth Amendment to the Loan
Documents and agreed to the elimination of a financial covenant. The loan is collateralized by the related project equipment. As
of September 30, 2016 there was an outstanding balance of $130,388 on this loan.

Note 7.     
       Notes Payable (continued)    

Debt issuance
costs of $7,476 are netted against this amount for presentation in the financial statements. The Company expects to maintain
compliance with all covenants of this loan through at least September 30, 2017. 

An Intercreditor Agreement exists
as part of the above mentioned loans with agencies of the State of Ohio. The OAQDA and ODSA agree to shared lien and security interest
through mutual covenants. These covenants include, but are not limited to, the creation of an agreed upon number of jobs, filing
of quarterly and annual reports and various financial covenants. 

During 2015, the Company made a final
payment and paid a 166 Direct Loan in full. During 2006, the Company was approved for this 166 Direct Loan from the Ohio Department
of Development, now known as the ODSA, in the amount of $400,000. These funds were received in July of 2008 and were used for the
purchase of production equipment and to reduce the Company s capital lease obligations on certain equipment. The term of
the loan was 84 months at a fixed interest rate of 3%. There was also a 0.25% annual servicing fee charged monthly on the outstanding
principal balance. The loan was collateralized by the related project equipment. On August 8, 2013, ODSA and the Company agreed
to a modification to the payment schedule. Interest and servicing payments of approximately $400 were paid monthly from August
2013 through January 2014. Beginning in February 2014, monthly payments of approximately $6,100, including principal, interest
and servicing fee were paid through July 2015. A final payment of approximately $42,200 was paid in August 2015. 

The Company was in compliance with
all covenants of these loans at September 30, 2016. It is possible that the Company may not be in compliance with all covenants
in future periods. If non-compliance is possible the Company will seek a waiver or amendment. In the past the lenders have granted
the Company a waiver or amendment when relief was sought. 

Note 8.     
       Income Taxes    

Following is the income tax (benefit) expense for the
three and nine months ended September 30: 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities
result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. A full valuation
allowance has been recorded against the realizability of the net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The
Company has net operating loss carryforwards available for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $4,700,000 which expire
in varying amounts through 2035.

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Note 9.    
      Liquidity   

Management has forecasted revenues
and related costs as well as investing plans and financing needs to determine liquidity to meet cash flow requirements and
believes the Company will have sufficient liquidity at least through September 30, 2017.  This forecast was based on current
cash levels and debt obligations, and the best estimates of revenues primarily from existing customers and gave consideration to
the continued and possible increased levels of uncertainty in demand in the markets in which the Company operates.  The
Company s ability to maintain current operations is dependent upon its ability to achieve these forecasted results, which
the Company believes will occur.  

Item 2.    
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion should be
read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes contained herein and with those in our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. 

Except for the historical information
contained herein, the matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include certain forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Those statements include, but may not be limited
to, all statements regarding our intent, belief, and expectations, such as statements concerning our future profitability and operating
and growth strategy. Words such as  believe,   anticipate,   expect,   will,   may, 
 should,   intend,   plan,   estimate,   predict,   potential, 
 continue,   likely  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Investors
are cautioned that all forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other statements we make
involve risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, the factors set forth under the caption  Risk Factors 
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and other factors detailed from time to time in
our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One or more of these factors have affected, and in the future could
affect our business and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from plans and projections. Although
we believe the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance
that any of the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. In light of
the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should
not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. 

Any forward-looking statement speaks
only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statements are made or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events, unless necessary to prevent such statements from becoming misleading. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for us to predict all factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. 

Overview 

SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. ( SCI ,
 we  or the  Company ), formerly Superconductive Components, Inc., an Ohio corporation, was incorporated
in 1987.  We operate in one segment as a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for Physical Vapor Deposition
( PVD ) Thin Film Applications.  We are focused on specific markets within the PVD industry (Photonics, Thin Film
Solar, Glass, Thin Film Battery and Transparent Electronics).  Substantially all of our revenues are generated from customers
with multi-national operations.  We have made considerable resource investment in the Thin Film Solar industry and a few customers
have adopted our products.  Thin Film Battery is a developing market where manufacturers of batteries use our products to
produce very small power supplies with small quantities of stored energy. Through collaboration with end users and Original Equipment
Manufacturers we develop innovative customized solutions enabling commercial success. 

Item 2.    
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)    

Executive Summary   

For the three months ended September
30, 2016, we had total revenue of $1,664,979 compared to $1,464,734 for the same time period in 2015, an increase of 13.7%. Quarterly
revenue increased primarily due to higher price and volume of a low margin commodity. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we had total revenue of $4,246,275. This was a decrease of $2,174,952, or 33.9%, compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Year-to-date revenue decreased primarily due to reductions on price and volume of the same low margin commodity compared
to last year. Also, volume was lower in our thin film solar market as orders continue to be cyclical. A customer in China requested
we delay shipment of nearly $200,000 of thin film solar product which was expected to ship in September. We anticipate total revenue
to be lower during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to previous quarters as volume is expected to be lower due to a major customer s
inventory adjustment.  During
September 2016 we terminated an order of more than $450,000 of thin film solar products. The order was received in January 2016;
however, we have been unable to establish communication with the customer in recent months. This had no immediate financial impact
as we had not purchased inventory and therefore had not started production on the order. 

We are encouraged by the resumption
of global growth in the thin film solar market, especially increased production of copper indium gallium selenide-based products.
These represent substantial growth opportunities for us as we continue to implement our thin film solar strategy. In addition,
we are pursuing several opportunities in our traditional business, including new applications which we anticipate customer orders. 

Gross profit was $370,463 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $357,325 for the same period in 2016. Gross profit was $916,932 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,601,217 for the same nine months in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 22.3%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 24.4% for the same period in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue
was 21.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 24.9% for the same period in 2015. 

Operating expenses were $1,368,139
and $1,550,913 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was a decrease of $182,774 or 11.8%. We
reclassified a portion of rent expense from operating expenses (general and administrative) to cost of goods sold to accurately
reflect an amount assigned to the manufacturing area of our facility. This was retroactively reclassified beginning January 1,
2015. 

We continue to invest in developing
new products for all of our markets including transparent conductive oxide systems for the thin film solar and transparent electronics
markets. We also have ongoing development efforts with our thin film battery materials and transparent electronic products. These
efforts include accelerating time to market for those products and involve research and development expense.

30, 2016, we had total revenue of $1,664,979 compared to $1,464,734 for the same time period in 2015, an increase of 13.7%. Quarterly
revenue increased primarily due to higher price and volume of a low margin commodity. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had total revenue of $4,264,275. This was a decrease of $2,174,952, or 33.9%,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue decreased primarily due to reductions on price and volume of
the same low margin commodity. The average cost of this raw material was lower by approximately 26% during the first nine
months of 2016 compared to the same time period in 2015. Pricing of this material has fluctuated widely during the past
several years. Also, volume was lower in our thin film solar market during the first nine months of 2016 versus the first
nine months of 2015. We expect total revenue to be lower during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to previous quarters as
volume is expected to be lower due to a major customer s inventory adjustment. 

Revenue from product sales is recognized
based on shipping terms or upon shipment to customers. Provisions for discounts and rework costs for returns are established when
products are shipped based on historical experience. Customer deposits represent cash received in advance of revenue earned. 

Gross Profit  

Gross profit
was $370,463 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $357,325 for the same three months in 2015. This was
an increase of $13,138, or 3.7%. Gross profit was $916,932 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$1,601,217 for the same nine months in 2015. This was a decrease of $684,285, or 42.7%. The decrease in gross profit was
attributed to lower revenue which, as discussed above, was primarily due to reductions on price and volume of a low margin
commodity. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin) was 22.3% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to
24.4% for the third quarter of 2015. Gross margin was 21.6% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 24.9% for the same
period in 2015. As previously mentioned, we reclassified a portion of rent expense from operating expenses (general
and administrative) to cost of goods sold to accurately reflect an amount assigned to the manufacturing area of our
facility. This was retroactively reclassified beginning January 1, 2015. 

General and Administrative Expense  

General and administrative expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $254,108 from $286,978 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
or 11.5%. The decrease is primarily related to lower travel expense of approximately $21,000. 

General and administrative expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $817,548 from $884,510 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
or 7.6%. The first nine months of 2016 included lower travel expense of approximately $40,000, bad debt expense of approximately
$11,000 and professional fees of approximately $13,000 while compensation increased approximately $20,000 compared to the first
nine months of 2015. 

Item 2.    
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)    

Professional Fees  

Included in general and administrative
expense was $37,393 and $38,914 for professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and
$141,921 and $155,291  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These continued
expenses are primarily related to SEC compliance costs for legal, accounting and stockholder relations fees. 

Research and Development Expense  

Research and development expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $87,246 compared to $136,900 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of 36.3%.
Research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $241,739 compared to $325,764 for the same period
in 2015, a decrease of 25.8%. The decrease was primarily due to sponsored research which began in 2014 and concluded early in the
first quarter of 2016. We had a collaborative program with a university to evaluate our TCO materials in liquid crystal display
applications. We continue to invest in developing new products for all of our markets including transparent conductive oxide systems
for applications in display and thin film solar markets. We also have ongoing development efforts with our thin film battery materials
and transparent electronic products. These efforts include accelerating time to market for those products and involve ongoing research
and development expense. 

Marketing and Sales Expense   

Marketing and sales expense was $95,010
and $104,363 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was approximately 9.0% and primarily
related to lower compensation, consulting and travel expenses. 

Marketing and sales expense was $308,852
and $340,639 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was approximately 9.3% and primarily
related to lower compensation, consulting, commission and travel expenses. 

Stock Compensation Expense  

Included in operating expenses were
non-cash stock based compensation costs of $52,489 and $55,849 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively
and $156,627 and $160,007 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation cost for all stock-based
awards is based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the required service (vesting) period. Unrecognized non-cash stock
based compensation expense related to operating expense was $223,233 as of September 30, 2016 and will be recognized through 2019. 

Interest  

Interest was $11,511 and $13,561
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest was $34,352 and $44,140 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was due to lower principal balances. 

Loss Applicable to Common Stock  

Loss applicable to common stock for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $83,450 compared to $189,478 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Loss
applicable to common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $503,716 compared to $11,950 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The changes were due to the variation of revenue and gross profit. 

Item 2.    
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)    

Common Stock   

The following schedule represents
our outstanding common stock during the period of 2016 through 2024 assuming all outstanding stock options are exercised during
the year of expiration. Based on outstanding shares at September 30, 2016, if each shareholder exercises his or her options, it
would increase our common shares by 536,857 to 4,605,901 by December 31, 2024. Assuming all such options are exercised in the year
of expiration, the effect on shares outstanding is illustrated as follows:  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash  

As of September 30, 2016 cash on
hand was $780,838. Cash on-hand was $997,170 at December 31, 2015. We believe, based on forecasted sales and expenses that cash
flow from operations will be adequate to sustain operations at least through September 30, 2017. 

Working Capital  

At September 30, 2016 working capital
was $706,011 compared to $1,010,517 at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $304,506 or 30.1%. As discussed below, cash decreased approximately
$216,000. Accounts receivable increased approximately $117,000 due to shipments late in the third quarter of 2016. Inventories
increased approximately $95,000, accounts payable increased approximately $81,000 and customer deposits increased approximately
$327,000 due to orders received during the first nine months of 2016 and expected to ship during the fourth quarter of 2016. Current
debt obligations decreased approximately $27,000. 

Cash from Operations  

Net cash provided by operating activities
was approximately $129,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and approximately $508,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Included in expenses were non cash stock based compensation costs of approximately $158,000 and $161,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Cash from Investing
Activities  

Cash of approximately $80,000 was
used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately $35,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Item 2.    
      Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)    

Cash from Financing
Activities  

Cash of approximately $269,000 and
$355,000 was used in financing activities for principal payments to third parties for capital lease obligations and notes payable
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016, proceeds of $4,200 were received from the
exercise of stock options. We paid $24,152 for cumulative dividends on preferred stock during the first nine months of 2015. 

Debt Outstanding  

Total debt outstanding decreased
from approximately $930,000 at December 31, 2015, to approximately $813,000 at September 30, 2016, or 12.6%. Debt issuance costs
of $19,665 at December 31, 2015, and $12,586 at September 30, 2016 are netted for financial statement presentation. During the
second quarter of 2016 we closed on a new capital lease obligation of approximately $145,000. During the fourth quarter of 2016
we expect to close on a new capital lease obligation of approximately $104,000 upon receipt and installation of equipment. 

Liquidity  

We have forecasted revenues and related
costs as well as investing plans and financing needs to determine liquidity to meet cash flow requirements and believe we
will have sufficient liquidity at least through September 30, 2017.  This forecast was based on current cash levels and debt
obligations, and the best estimates of revenues primarily from existing customers and gave consideration to the continued and possible
increased levels of uncertainty in demand in the markets in which we operate.  Our ability to maintain current operations
is dependent upon our ability to achieve these forecasted results, which we believe will occur.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off
balance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements
and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes  .
  Note 2 to the Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, describes
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but
not limited to, accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory allowances, property and equipment depreciable lives,
patents and licenses useful lives, revenue recognition, tax valuation allowance, stock based compensation and assessing changes
in which impairment of certain long-lived assets may occur. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical
accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts
and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults
are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected. Inventory
purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our
products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements,
we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected. Depreciable and useful
lives estimated for property and equipment, licenses and patents are based on initial expectations of the period of time these
assets and intangibles will benefit us. Changes in circumstances related to a change in our business, change in technology or other
factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets. 

Item 4.       
       Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation
of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Due to a segregation of duties material
weakness described below, and based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the
reasonable assurance level, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and in ensuring that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
discussions regarding required disclosure. Until we are able to hire additional employees, we will continue to report to the Audit
Committee and the Board of Directors at least monthly (and more often as necessary). We believe this will continue to mitigate
this weakness. This reporting includes balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of cash flows, and other detail supporting
these statements. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material
respects, our financial condition, results of operation, changes in shareholder s equity and cash flows for all periods presented. 

Inherent Limitations over Internal
Controls  

Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject to the risk that those internal
controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

Item 4.    
      Controls and procedures (continued)    

Management previously disclosed a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in its annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 19, 2016, for
the year ended December 31, 2015, relating to insufficient segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Management
is aware of the risks associated with the lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees currently working
with general administrative and financial matters. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always
be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody
of assets and the recording of transactions shall be performed by separate individuals. In order to remediate this weakness, we
will need to hire additional employees. Although we will periodically reevaluate this situation, at this point we consider that
the risks associated with such lack of segregation of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties
are not cost justified. Until we are able to hire additional employees, we will continue to report to the Audit Committee and the
Board of Directors at least monthly (and more often as necessary). We believe this will continue to mitigate this weakness. This
reporting includes balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of cash flows, and other detail supporting these statements. 

Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting for the three months ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected or were reasonably likely
to materially affect our disclosure controls and procedures. Additionally, there were no changes in our internal controls that
could materially affect our disclosure controls and procedures subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

4.  The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining

a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures

subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared;   

b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial

control over financial reporting; and   

5.  The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s
board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information; and   

b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
