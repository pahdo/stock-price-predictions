Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.   

Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. All statements
other than statements of historical fact are statements that could
be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited to,
statements regarding estimation of uranium production and pricing,
which are based on information from the uranium producers who are
planning to produce uranium from lands in which the Company holds a
royalty interest.  Actual results and future developments
could differ materially from the results or developments expressed
in or implied by these forward-looking statements.  These
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, volatility
of uranium prices, market supply and demand, competition,
environmental hazards, health and safety conditions, regulation or
government action, litigation and uncertainties about estimates of
reserves.  For a discussion of the factors, including without
limitation, those that could materially and adversely affect
Excalibur s actual results and performance, see  Risk
Factors  set forth on page 3 of Excalibur s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31,
2016.  Excalibur undertakes no obligation, other than that
imposed by law, to make any revisions to the forward-looking
statements contained in this filing or to update them to reflect
circumstances occurring after the date of this filing. 

This
discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed
financial statements and notes presented in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q and the financial statements and notes in the
last filed Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the period
ended May 31, 2016 for a full understanding of the
Company s financial position. 

Background 

Excalibur
Industries ( Excalibur ) is a Utah corporation formed
by the consolidation of Tower Enterprises (formerly Moab Uranium
Company) and The Thrifty Helper on June 1, 1971. In January 1972,
Excalibur purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of Mountain West Mines, Inc. ( Mountain
West ), a Nevada corporation, which is now a wholly owned
subsidiary of Excalibur. Excalibur and Mountain West are
hereinafter collectively referred to as Excalibur or
Company. 

Excalibur
is a natural resource business enterprise focused on uranium, an
industry that has languished for decades following the 1979 Three
Mile Island power station incident, and, more recently, the 2011
earthquake and tsunami that severely damaged Japan s
Fukushima Daiichi power station. However, most industry pundits are
cautiously forecasting a positive future for the industry,
including an increase in pricing of yellowcake, in the long
term. 

Current Activity 

Excalibur s
uranium position in the Powder River Basin is maintained by royalty
agreements held by Excalibur with two uranium producers, Energy
Fuels, Inc., which acquired Uranerz Energy Corporation in June 2015
( Energy Fuels ) and Cameco Corporation
( Cameco ). 

With
the acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation, Energy Fuels now
operates the uranium processing facility at the Nichols Ranch
property, in which Excalibur holds a royalty interest (6% or 8%
depending on the spot price of uranium). The Nichols Ranch facility
was commissioned in April 2014, and uranium production began in
June 2014. Energy Fuels/Uranerz produced a total of 103,164.0
pounds of uranium concentrate ( yellowcake ) from the
Nichols Ranch in the second calendar quarter of 2016, resulting in
a royalty payment of $172,572.74. Production from the Nichols Ranch
is difficult to estimate for the remainder of 2016 due to poor
market conditions. The timing and amount of production by Uranez
are subject to change and beyond the control of
Excalibur. 

Cameco
continues uranium production from its facility at the North Butte
property, in which Excalibur holds a 4% royalty interest. The
royalty to be paid to Excalibur is based on Cameco s
quarterly average realized uranium price as reported in
Cameco s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Cameco produced 71,288.8 pounds of uranium concentrate from the
North Butte in the second calendar quarter of 2016, resulting in a
royalty payment of $122,322.34. In April 2016, Cameco announced
that it would be curtailing production at its U.S. uranium
operations in response to market conditions. Future production is
difficult to estimate. Again, the timing and amount of production
reported by Cameco are subject to change and are beyond the control
of Excalibur. 

5 

The
final installment of $50,000 owed to Cliffs Natural Resources from
production royalty on North Butte and Ruby Ranch properties under
the 2009 Settlement Agreement is scheduled to be paid in December
2016. 

Executive Compensation.  For calendar
year 2016, Jay R. Mackie, Excalibur s President and CEO, is
compensated at the rate of $8,000 per month plus restrictive stock
with a total aggregate market value of approximately $40,000
annually, paid quarterly, and Michael P. Johnson, Excalibur s
Secretary and Treasurer, is compensated at the rate of $1,250 per
month. For calendar year 2016, all Board members will be
compensated $3,625 annually, paid quarterly, plus restrictive stock
with a total aggregate fair market value of approximately $375,
which was issued June 30, 2016. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk. 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2016,

financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.
