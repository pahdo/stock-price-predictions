   NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS     
     
   Organization   
     
  Marathon is an IP licensing and commercialization company. The Company acquires and manages IP rights from a variety of sources, including large and small corporations, universities and other IP owners. Marathon has a global focus on IP acquisition and management. The Company s commercialization division is focused on the full commercialization lifecycle which includes discovering opportunities, performing due diligence, providing capital, managing development, protecting and developing IP, assisting in execution of the business plan, and realizing shareholder value.  
     
  Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name Verve Ventures, Inc. On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to American Strategic Minerals Corporation and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. In June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In October 2012, we discontinued our real estate business when our CEO joined the firm and we commenced our current business, at which time the Company s name was changed to Marathon Patent Group, Inc.  
     
  On December 7, 2011, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to  American Strategic Minerals Corporation  from  Verve Ventures, Inc. , and increase the Company s authorized capital to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. During June 2012, the Company decided to discontinue its exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business.  
     
  On August 1, 2012, the shareholders holding a majority of the Company s voting capital voted in favor of (i) changing the name of the Company to  Fidelity Property Group, Inc.  and (ii) the adoption the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and reserving 10,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder (the  2012 Plan ).  The board of directors of the Company (the  Board of Directors ) approved the name change and the adoption of the 2012 Plan on August 1, 2012. The Company did not file an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada and subsequently abandoned the decision to adopt the  Fidelity Property Group, Inc.  name and discontinued its real estate business.  
     
  On October 1, 2012, the shareholders holding a majority of the Company s voting capital had voted and authorized the Company to (i) change the name of the Company to Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (the  Name Change ) and (ii) effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock by a ratio of 3-for-2 (the  Reverse Split ) within one year from the date of approval of the stockholders of the Company.  The Board of Directors approved the Name Change and the Reverse Split on October 1, 2012. The Board of Directors determined the name  Marathon Patent Group, Inc.  better reflected the long-term strategy in exploring other opportunities and the identity of the Company going forward. On February 15, 2013, the Company filed the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate the Name Change. On May 31, 2013, shareholders of record holding a majority of the outstanding voting capital of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-five and not more than one-for-fifteen at any time prior to April 30, 2014, with such ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion. On June 24, 2013, the reverse stock split ratio of one (1) for thirteen (13) basis was approved by the Board of Directors. On July 18, 2013, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.0001 per share on a one (1) for thirteen (13) basis. All share and per share values for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the reverse stock split.  
     
  On September 16, 2014, the Board of Directors approved and adopted, subject to shareholder approval on or prior to September 16, 2015, the Company s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company at the annual meeting held on July 31, 2015.  
     
  On November 19, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a stock dividend pursuant to which holders of the Company s Common Stock as of the close of business of the record date of December 15, 2014 received one additional share of Common Stock at the close of business on December 22, 2014 for each share of Common Stock held by such holders. Throughout this report, all share and per share values for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the stock dividend.

   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
   Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   
     
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and present the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company, all intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated. All adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been included. The results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Other than where noted, the accounting policies and procedures employed in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained in Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 30, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from those financial statements.  
     
   Cash   
     
  The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances at one financial institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company s accounts held at this institution, up to a limit of $250,000, are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). As of September 30, 2016, the Company had bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institution, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which it holds deposits.  
     
   Variable Interest Entities   
     
  Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, accounting guidance concerning variable interest entities, or VIE, addresses the consolidation of a business enterprise to which the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. This guidance focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. The guidance requires an assessment of who the primary beneficiary is and whether the primary beneficiary should consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary is identified as the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. Application of the VIE consolidation requirements may require the exercise of significant judgment by management.  
     
  On August 11, 2016, PG Technologies S.a.r.l. ( PG Tech ), a Luxembourg limited liability company jointly owned with a large litgation financing fund, entered into a Patent Funding and Exclusive License Agreement (the  ELA ) to manage the monetization of greater than 10,000 patents in a single industry vertical with a Fortune 50 company. The patents cover all the major global economies including China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.  The Company determined that the the Company s ownership interest constitutes a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary because the Company satisfies both the power and benefits criterion pursuant to ASC 810. As a result, the Company will consolidate the VIE within its financial statements.   
     
   Use of Estimates and Assumptions   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, estimating the useful lives of patent assets, the assumptions used to calculate fair value of warrants and options granted, goodwill impairment, intangible asset impairment, realization of long-lived assets, deferred income taxes, unrealized tax positions and business combination accounting.

   Accounts Receivable   
     
   The Company has a policy of reserving for questionable accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable.  The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in    doubt.  Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the bad debt expense after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded an allowance for bad debts in the amounts of $387,976 and $375,750, respectively.  Accounts receivable-net at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounted to $81,865 and $136,842, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there were no accounts receivable related to the issuance of one-time licenses, accounts receivable related to recurring royalties represented approximately 100% of total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2015, accounts receivable related to one license accounted for approximately 54% of the Company s total accounts receivable and accounts receivable related to recurring royalties represented 46% of total accounts receivable. 
     
   Concentration of Revenue and Geographic Area   
     
  Patent license revenue from enforcement activities originates in either the United States or Germany. Revenue attributable to the United States involves US patents, revenue attributable to Germany is based on the enforcement of German patents and in the event that the Company enters into a worldwide license, the revenue is allocated between the two. The Company commenced enforcement actions in France in 2015, but has not yet had any revenue attributable to this country; the Company has not initiated enforcement actions in any other countries, but is evaluating a number of countries for future action.  
     
  The Company entered into no new licenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and revenue from the five largest licenses accounting for 87% of the revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as set forth below:  

The remainder of the revenue is attributable to smaller licenses and running royalties in the Company s Medtech portfolio.  
     
  While the Company has a growing portfolio of patents, the Company has historically received a significant portion of its revenue and expects that a significant portion of its future revenues were and will be based on one-time grants of similar non-recurring, non-exclusive, non-assignable licenses to a relatively small number of entities and their affiliates. Further, with the expected small number of firms with which the Company enters into license agreements, and the amount and timing of such license agreements, the Company also expects that its revenues may be highly variable from one period to the next.

  In connection with our enforcement activities, we are currently involved in multiple patent infringement cases. As of September 30, 2016, the Company is involved in a total of 21 lawsuits against defendants in the following jurisdictions:

Revenue Recognition   
     
  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition . Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) all obligations have been substantially performed, (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability of amounts is reasonably assured.  
     
  The Company considers its licensing and enforcement activities as one unit of accounting under ASC 605-25,  Multiple-Element Arrangements  as the delivered items do not have value to customers on a standalone basis, there are no undelivered elements and there is no general right of return relative to the license. Under ASC 605-25, the appropriate recognition of revenue is determined for the combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the final elements, including the license for past and future use, and the release.  
     
  Also, due to the fact that the settlement element and license element for past and future use are the major central business, the Company does not present these two elements as different revenue streams in its statement of operations. The Company does not expect to provide licenses that do not provide some form of settlement or release. The Company derived approximately 0% and 99% of its revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from the one-time issuance of non-recurring, non-exclusive, non-assignable licenses for certain of the Company s patents, with the balance comprised of recurring royalties and approximately 97% and 94% of its revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, from the one-time issuance of non-recurring, non-exclusive, non-assignable licenses for certain of the Company s patents, with the balance comprised of recurring royalties.  
     
  The Company s subsidiaries entered into 0 and 11 new license agreements that generated revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
     
   Cost of Revenues   
     
  Cost of revenues mainly includes expenses incurred in connection with the Company s patent enforcement activities, such as legal fees, consulting costs, patent maintenance, royalty fees for acquired patents and other related expenses. Cost of revenues does not include patent amortization expenses, which are included as a separate line item in operating expenses and cost of revenues also does not include expenses related to product development, integration or support, as these are included in general and administrative expenses.  
     
   Prepaid Expenses, Bonds Posted and Other Current Assets   
     
  Prepaid expenses and other current assets of $153,388 and $338,598 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services, which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses include prepayments in cash and equity instruments for public relation services, business advisory, consulting, and prepaid insurance, which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.  
     
  In addition, the Company had outstanding litigation bonds in the amount of $980,919 and $1,748,311 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These bonds were entered into in Germany after the successful ruling by the court in first instance trials related to some of the Company s patents in German courts. The difference in the balance of the litigation bonds at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 is attributable to $175,883 in currency translation impact, the return of $1,944,085 in bonds related to the IP Liquidity and Medtech litigations and the placing of bonds in Germany related to the TLI litigations in the amount of $1,000,810.

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
   The Company adopted FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value    measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company s financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: 

Level 1:       
 
  Observable inputs such as quoted   market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities           

Level 2:       
 
  Observable market-based inputs or   unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data           

Level 3:       
 
  Unobservable inputs for which   there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting   entity s own assumptions.              
     
  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, bonds posted with courts, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate their estimated fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of notes payable and other long-term liabilities approximates fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the Company.  
     
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $4,482,845 in Level 3 goodwill. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company added $0 in goodwill associated with acquisitions and the Company impaired the goodwill associated with one of its portfolios in the amount of $83,000. In addition, the Company experienced a gain in the value of the goodwill held by foreign subsidiaries to to foreign exchange adjustments in the amount of $83,284.  This resulted in a fair value of the Company s Level 3 goodwill as of September 30, 2016 of $4,483,129.  
     
  Clouding IP earn out liability was determined to be a Level 3 liability, which requires the remeasurement of fair value at each period end by using discounted cash flow analysis using unobservable inputs, such as revenue and expenses forecasts, timing of proceeds, and a discount rate. Based on the remeasurement of fair value as of September 30, 2016, the Company determined that the Clouding IP earn out liability was $110,100 for current portion and $1,082,586 for the long-term portion, which resulted in gain from change in fair value of $1,954,368 and $2,122,208 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and a gain from change in fair value adjustment of $597,047 and $2,901,348 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
  Under certain circumstances related to litigations in Germany, the Company is either required to or may decide to enter into a bond with the courts. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding bonds in the amount of $980,919 and $1,748,311, respectively. The Company adjusted the value as of September 30, 2016 of the bonds to reflect changes to the exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar.  
     
   Accounting for Acquisitions   
     
  In the normal course of its business, the Company makes acquisitions of patent assets and may also make acquisitions of businesses.  With respect to each such transaction, the Company evaluates facts of the transaction and follows the guidelines prescribed in accordance with ASC 805   Business Combinations to determine the proper accounting treatment for each such transaction and then records the transaction in accordance with the conclusions reached in such analysis.  The Company performs such analysis with respect to each material acquisition within the consolidated group of entities.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Income Taxes  which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.

Table of Contents   
     
  The Company follows the provision of the ASC 740-10 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Position. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be situated upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely that not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.  
     
  Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.  
     
  The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For a tax position considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they were filed. The Company is in the process of filing the 2015 tax returns. After review of the 2015 financial statements and the results of operations through September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded a deferred tax asset in the amount of $11,918,920, from which the Company expects to realize benefits in the future, and a deferred tax liability of $438,709.  
     
  The Company files U.S. and state income tax returns with varying statutes of limitations. The 2011 through 2015 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities.  
     
   Basic and Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) per Share   
     
  Net earnings (loss) per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260: Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ). Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has options to purchase 3,665,314 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 556,672 shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2016, but since the Company is in a loss position, there is no calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share.

Table of Contents   
     
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:  

Intangible Assets   
     
  Intangible assets include patents purchased and patents acquired in lieu of cash in licensing transactions. The patents purchased are recorded based on the cost to acquire them and patents acquired in lieu of cash are recorded at their fair market value. The costs of these assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives. Useful lives of intangible assets are periodically evaluated for reasonableness and the assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. The Company recorded impairment charges to its intangible assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amounts of $5,531,383 and 6,525,273 respectively, associated with the end of life of a number of the Company s portfolios, compared to an impairment charge in the amount of $0 and $766,498, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 associated with the reduction in the carrying value of one the Company s portfolios.  
     
   Goodwill   
     
  Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in accordance with ASC 350, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. In accordance with ASC 350-30-65,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Others , the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:  
     
  1.                      Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; 
  2.                      Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; 
  3.                      Significant negative industry or economic trends; and 
  4.                      Significant reduction or exhaustion of the potential licenses of the patents which gave rise to the goodwill. 
     
  When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first compares the fair value of the Company s reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company performed the annual testing for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded an impairment charge to its goodwill in the amount of $0 and $83,000, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recorded an impairment charge to its goodwill in the amount of $0 and $0, respectively. The impairment charge to goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the determination that one or the Company s portfolios had reached the end of its useful life.

   Impairment of Long-lived Assets   
     
  The Company accounts for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets according to the ASC 360  Property, Plant and Equipment .  The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. When necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.  
     
   Stock-based Compensation   
     
  Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  
     
  Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. As stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest, forfeitures are also estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the expected forfeiture rate was 11.03%, which resulted in an expense of $9,570 and $36,832 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, recognized in the Company s compensation expenses. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the expected forfeiture rate was 11.66%, which resulted in an expense of $8,423 and $16,004 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, recognized in the Company s compensation expenses. The Company will continue to re-assess the impact of forfeitures if actual forfeitures change in future quarters.  
     
   Reclassification   
     
  Certain amounts in the financial statements of prior year have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2016 presentation, with no effect on net earnings.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The standard is intended to eliminate diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2017 and we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  The amendments in    the ASU eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years and should be applied prospectively upon the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.   This update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  This update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.  Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period.  The Company adopted this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2015.  The effect of adopting the new guidance on the balance sheet was not significant.  
     
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  or ASU 2015-16. This amendment requires the acquirer in a business combination to recognize in the reporting period in which adjustment amounts are determined, any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-16, an acquirer was required to restate prior period financial statements as of the acquisition date for adjustments to provisional amounts.  The new standard for an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017 with an earlier effective application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The new guidance is not expected to have significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software; Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement . Prior to this ASU, U.S. GAAP did not include explicit guidance about a customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. Examples of cloud computing arrangements include software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and other similar hosting arrangements. This ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, in which case the customer should account for such license consistent with the acquisitions of other software licenses. If the cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The ASU does not change the accounting for service contracts. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs (ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs) , effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption of the new guidance is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new guidance will require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, consistent with debt discounts.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and as such, the debt issuance costs for Fortress note was presented in the balance sheet as direct deduction from the related debt liability.  
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard update provides guidance around management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new guidance is effective for all annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accountings Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , or ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and shall take effective on January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and the early application of the standard is not permitted. The Company is presently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and has not yet selected a transition method.  
     
  There were other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

   NOTE 3   ACQUISITIONS   
     
    HISTORICAL ACQUSITIONS    
     
    Dynamic Advances, IP Liquidity and Sarif Biomedical    
     
  On May 2, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of certain ownership rights (the  Acquired Intellectual Property ) from TechDev, Granicus IP, LLC ( Granicus ) and the Spangenberg Family Foundation ( SFF ) pursuant to the terms of three purchase agreements between: (i) the Company, TechDev, SFF and DA Acquisition LLC, a newly formed Texas limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; (ii) the Company, Granicus, SFF and IP Liquidity Ventures Acquisition LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and (iii) the Company, TechDev, SFF and Sarif Biomedical Acquisition LLC  (Sarif ), a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the  DA Agreement,  the  IP Liquidity Agreement  and the  Sarif Agreement,  respectively and the collective transactions, the  Acquisitions ).  
     
   Dynamic Advances   
     
  Pursuant to the DA Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of Dynamic Advances, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, in consideration for: (i) two cash payments of $2,375,000, one payment due at closing and the other payment due on or before September 30, 2014, with such second payment being subject to increase to $2,850,000 if not made on or before June 30, 2014; and (ii) 195,500 shares of the Company s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Under the terms of the DA Agreement, TechDev and SFF are entitled to possible future payments for a maximum consideration of $250,000,000 pursuant to the Pay Proceeds Agreement described below. Dynamic Advances holds exclusive license to monetize certain patents owned by a third party.  
     
  On May 2, 2014, the Company issued TechDev and SFF a promissory note in order to evidence the second cash payment due under the terms of the DA Agreement in the amount of $2,375,000 due on or before September 30, 2014, with such amount due under the terms of the promissory note being subject to increase to $2,850,000 if the Company s payment pursuant to the terms of the DA Agreement were not made on or before June 30, 2014. The promissory note matured on September 30, 2014; effective September 30, 2014, TechDev and SFF extended the maturity to March 31, 2015 in return for a payment of $249,375, payable within thirty days. The payment for this extension of the maturity date was made on October 10, 2014 and the promissory note was repaid on April 1, 2015. The promissory note did not otherwise include any interest payable by the Company. Since the Company did not make the payment on the promissory note prior to June 30, 2014, the Company included in the consideration paid for Dynamic Advances the promissory note balance of $2,850,000.  Further, the Company had the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock valued by a third party firm that determined, based on the rights and privileges of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, that it was on par with the value of the Company s Common Stock. The total amount of consideration paid by the Company for Dynamic Advances, including capitalized costs associated with the purchase, was $6,653,078.  
     
  After evaluating the facts and circumstances of the purchase, the Company determined that this was an asset purchase. In coming to its conclusion, the Company reviewed the status of the assets, the historical activity and the absence of any employees, licenses, revenues, and any other assets other than the IP Assets.  Further, as there were no assumed licensees or historical revenues, the Company was not certain that it would be able to obtain access to customers pursuant to AC 805-10-55-7.  
     
   IP Liquidity   
     
  Pursuant to the IP Liquidity Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of IP Liquidity Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in consideration for: (i) two cash payments of $2,375,000, one payment due at closing and the other payment due on or before September 30, 2014, with such second payment being subject to increase to $2,850,000 if not made on or before June 30, 2014; and (ii) 195,500 shares of the Company s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.  Under the terms of the IP Liquidity Agreement, Granicus and SFF are entitled to possible future payments for a maximum consideration of $250,000,000 pursuant to the Pay Proceeds Agreement described below.  IP Liquidity Ventures, LLC holds contract rights to the proceeds from the monetization of certain patents owned by a number of third parties.

Further, as there were no assumed licensees or historical revenues, the Company was not certain that it would be able to obtain access to customers pursuant to AC 805-10-55-7.  
     
   Sarif Biomedical   
     
  Pursuant to the Sarif Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the limited liability company membership interests of Sarif, a Delaware limited liability company, in consideration for two cash payments of $250,000, one payment due at closing and the other payment due on or before September 30, 2014, with such second payment being subject to increase to $300,000 if not made on or before June 30, 2014.  Under the terms of the Sarif Agreement, TechDev is entitled to possible future payments for a maximum consideration of $250,000,000 pursuant to the Pay Proceeds Agreement described below. Sarif holds ownership rights to certain patents.  
     
  On May 2, 2014, the Company issued TechDev a promissory note in order to evidence the second cash payment due under the terms of the Sarif Agreement in the amount of $250,000 due on or before September 30, 2014, with such amount due under the terms of the promissory note being subject to increase to $300,000 if the Company s payment pursuant to the terms of the Sarif Agreement were not made on or before September 30, 2014. The promissory note matured on September 30, 2014. Effective September 30, 2014, TechDev extended the maturity to March 31, 2015 in return for a payment of $26,250, payable within thirty days. The payment for this extension of the maturity date was made on October 10, 2014 and the promissory note was repaid on February 24, 2015. The promissory note did not otherwise include any interest payable by the Company. Since the Company did not make the payment on the promissory note prior to June 30, 2014, the Company included in the consideration paid for Dynamic Advances the higher principal amount of the promissory note. The total amount of consideration paid by the Company for Sarif, including capitalized costs associated with the purchase, was $552,024.  
     
  After evaluating the facts and circumstances of the purchase, the Company determined that this was an asset purchase. In coming to its conclusion, the Company reviewed the status of the assets, the historical activity and the absence of any employees, licenses, revenues, and any other assets other than the IP Assets. Further, as there were no assumed licensees or historical revenues, the Company was not certain that it would be able to obtain access to customers pursuant to AC 805-10-55-7.

Interest shall be paid in cash except that 2.75% per annum of the interest due on each Interest Payment Date shall be paid-in-kind, by increasing the principal amount of the Fortress Notes by the amount of such interest, effective as of the applicable Interest Payment Date ( PIK Interest ).  PIK Interest shall be treated as added principal of the Initial Note for all purposes, including interest accrual and the calculation of any prepayment premium. 
     
  The Fortress Securities Purchase Agreement contains certain customary events of default, and also contains certain covenants including a requirement that the Company maintain minimum liquidity of $1,000,000 in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and that the Company shall have Monetization Revenues (as defined in the Fortress Securities Purchase Agreement) for each of the four fiscal quarters commencing December 31, 2014 of at least $15,000,000.  
     
  The terms of the Fortress Warrant provide that until January 29, 2020, the Fortress Warrant may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis. Exercisability of the Fortress Warrant is limited if, upon exercise, the holder would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the Company s Common Stock.  
     
  As part of the transaction, DBD entered into a lock-up agreement (the  Lock-Up Agreement ) pursuant to which the parties and certain related holders agreed until the earlier of 12 months or acceleration of an Event of Default (as defined in the Fortress Securities Purchase Agreement), that they will not, directly or indirectly, (i) offer, sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, hedge, hypothecate, pledge, sell any option or contract to purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell (or announce any offer, sale, offer of sale, contract of sale, hedge, hypothecation, pledge, sale of any option or contract to purchase, purchase of any option or contract of sale, grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase or other sale or disposition), or otherwise transfer or dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future), the Lock-Up Shares (as defined in the Lock-Up Agreement), beneficially owned, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), by such Holder and his/her Related Group (as such terms are defined in the Lock-Up Agreement) on the date of the Lock-Up Agreement or thereafter acquired or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Lock-Up Shares, whether or not any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of any Lock-Up Shares.  The Holders may purchase additional shares of the Company s Common Stock during the Lock-Up Period (as defined in the Lock-Up Agreement) to the extent that such purchase only increases the net holding of the Holders in the Company.  
     
   In connection with the transactions described above, TechDev, Audrey Spangenberg, Erich Spangenberg, and Granicus (the  Spangenberg Holders ) entered into a lock-up agreement (the  Spangenberg Lockup ) with respect to 1,626,924 shares of Common Stock, 48,078 shares of Common Stock underlying warrants, and 782,000 shares of Common Stock underlying preferred stock, pursuant to which the Spangenberg Holders agreed that until payment in full of the Note Obligations (as defined in the Fortress Notes), which shall include but not be limited to all principal and interest on outstanding Fortress Notes pursuant to the Fortress Securities Purchase Agreement, the Spangenberg Holders and certain related parties agreed that they will not, directly or indirectly, (i) offer, sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, hedge, hypothecate, pledge, sell any option or contract to purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell (or announce any offer, sale, offer of sale, contract of sale, hedge, hypothecation, pledge, sale of any option or contract to purchase, purchase of any option or contract of sale, grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase or other sale or disposition), or otherwise transfer or dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future), more than 5% of the Spangenberg Lockup shares (as defined in the Spangenberg Lock-Up Agreement), beneficially owned, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, by such Holder and his/her Related Group (as such terms are defined in the Spangenberg Lock-Up Agreement) on the date of the Spangenberg Lock-Up    Agreement or thereafter acquired or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of more than 5% of the Spangenberg Lock-Up Shares, whether or not any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of any Lock-Up Shares. The Spangenberg Holders may purchase additional shares of the Company s Common Stock during the Lock-Up Period (as defined in the Spangenberg Lock-Up Agreement) to the extent that such purchase only increases the net holding of the Holders in the Company.

   Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     
     
  This report on Form 10-Q ( Report ) and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us may contain so-called  forward-looking statements,  all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as  expects,   plans,   will,   forecasts,   projects,   intends,   estimates,  and other words of similar meaning.  One can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  These statements are likely to address our growth strategy, financial results and product and development programs.  One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements.  These factors may include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not.  No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.  
     
  Information regarding market and industry statistics contained in this Report is included based on information available to us that we believe is accurate.  It is generally based on industry and other publications that are not produced for purposes of securities offerings or economic analysis.  We have not reviewed or included data from all sources, and cannot assure investors of the accuracy or completeness of the data included in this Report.  Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties accompanying any estimates of future market size, revenue and market acceptance of products and services.  We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.  As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  
     
   Overview   
     
  We acquire patents and patent rights from owners or other ventures and seek to monetize the value of the patents through litigation and licensing strategies, alone or with others.  Part of our acquisition strategy is to acquire or invest in patents and patent rights that cover a wide-range of subject matter which allows us to seek the benefits of a diversified portfolio of assets in differing industries and countries.  Generally, the patents and patent rights that we seek to acquire have large identifiable targets who are or have been using technology that we believe infringes our patents and patent rights.  We generally monetize our portfolio of patents and patent rights by entering into license discussions, and if that is unsuccessful, initiating enforcement activities against any infringing parties with the objective of entering into comprehensive settlement and license agreements that may include the granting of non-exclusive retroactive and future rights to use the patented technology, a covenant not to sue, a release of the party from certain claims, the dismissal of any pending litigation and other terms.  Our strategy has been developed with the expectation that it will result in a long-term, diversified revenue stream for the Company. As of September 30, 2016, we owned 519 U.S. and foreign patents.  
     
  Our principal office is located at 11100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 380, Los Angeles, CA 90225. Our telephone number is (703) 232-1701.  
     
  We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name  Verve Ventures, Inc.  On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to  American Strategic Minerals Corporation  and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. During June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In November 2012, we discontinued our real estate business.  
     
  On July 18, 2013, we filed a certificate of amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.0001 per share on a one (1) for thirteen (13) basis (the  Reverse Split ). The Reverse Split became effective with FINRA at the open of business on July 22, 2013. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every thirteen shares of our pre-reverse split common stock was combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share received the next highest number of whole shares.  
     
  On November 19, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a stock dividend ( Dividend ) pursuant to which holders of the Company s Common Stock as of the close of business of the record date of December 15, 2014 received one additional share of Common Stock at the close of business on December 22, 2014 for each share of Common Stock held by such holders. Throughout this Report, all share and per share values for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the stock dividend.  
     
  Throughout this Report, each instance in which we refer to a number of shares of our Common Stock, the number refers to the number of shares of Common Stock after giving effect to the Reverse Split and the Dividend, unless otherwise indicated.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
     
  Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.  
     
  Principles of Consolidation  
     
  The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP and present the financial statements of the Company and our wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries.  In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.  
     
   Variable Interest Entities   
     
  Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, accounting guidance concerning variable interest entities, or VIE, addresses the consolidation of a business enterprise to which the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. This guidance focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. The guidance requires an assessment of who the primary beneficiary is and whether the primary beneficiary should consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary is identified as the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. Application of the VIE consolidation requirements may require the exercise of significant judgment by management.  
     
  On August 11, 2016, PG Technologies S.a.r.l. ( PG Tech ), a Luxembourg limited liability company jointly owned with a large litgation financing fund, entered into a Patent Funding and Exclusive License Agreement (the  ELA ) to manage the monetization of greater than 10,000 patents in a single industry vertical with a Fortune 50 company. The patents cover all the major global economies including China, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Company determined that the the Company s ownership interest constitutes a VIE and that the Company is the primary beneficiary because the Company satisfies both the power and benefits criterion pursuant to ASC 810. As a result, the Company will consolidate the VIE within its financial statements.  
     
  Use of Estimates and Assumptions  
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, estimating the useful lives of patent assets, the assumptions used to calculate fair value of warrants and options granted, goodwill impairment, realization of long-lived assets, deferred income taxes, unrealized tax positions and business combination accounting.  
     
  Revenue Recognition  
     
  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) all obligations have been substantially performed, (iii) amounts are fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability of amounts is reasonably assured.  
     
  The Company considers the revenue generated from a settlement and licensing agreement as one unit of accounting under ASC 605-25,  Multiple-Element Arrangements  as the delivered items do not have value to customers on a standalone basis, there are no undelivered elements and there is no general right of return relative to the license. Under ASC 605-25, the appropriate recognition of revenue is determined for the combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the final elements, including the license for past and future use and the release.  
     
  Also, due to the fact that the settlement element and license element for past and future use are the Company s major central business, the Company presents these two elements as one revenue category in its statement of operations. The Company does not expect to provide licenses that do not provide some form of settlement or release.  
     
  Accounting for Acquisitions  
     
  In the normal course of its business, the Company makes acquisitions of patent assets and may also make acquisitions of businesses.  With respect to each such transaction, the Company evaluates facts of the transaction and follows the guidelines prescribed in accordance with ASC 805   Business Combinations to determine the proper accounting treatment for each such transaction and then records the transaction in accordance with the conclusions reached in such analysis. The Company performs such analysis with respect to each material acquisition within the consolidated group of entities.

  Intangible Assets - Patents  
     
  Intangible assets include patents purchased and patents acquired in lieu of cash in licensing transactions. The patents purchased are recorded based on the cost to acquire them and patents acquired in lieu of cash are recorded at their fair market value.  The costs of these assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives. Useful lives of intangible assets are periodically evaluated for reasonableness and the assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. The Company recorded impairment charges to its intangible assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amounts of $5,531,383 and 6,525,273, respectively, associated with the end of life of a number of the Company s portfolios, compared to an impairment charge in the amount of $0 and $766,498, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 associated with the reduction in the carrying value of one the Company s portfolios.  
     
  Goodwill  
     
  Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in accordance with ASC 350, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. In accordance with ASC 350-30-65,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Others , the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following:  
     
  1.                                         Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; 
  2.                                         Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; 
  3.                                         Significant negative industry or economic trends; and 
  4.                                         Significant reduction or exhaustion of the potential licenses of the patents which gave rise to the goodwill. 
     
  When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge. The Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the Company then applies a two-step impairment test. The two-step impairment test first compares the fair value of the Company s reporting unit to its carrying or book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company performs the annual testing for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level during the quarter ended September 30.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded an impairment charge to its goodwill in the amount of $0 and $83,000, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recorded an impairment charge to its goodwill in the amount of $0 and $0, respectively.  The impairment charge to goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the determination that one of the Company s portfolios had reached the end of its useful life.  
     
  Stock-based Compensation  
     
  Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  
     
   Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third parties, compensation expense is determined at the  measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. As stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest, forfeitures are also estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the expected forfeiture rate was 11.03%, which resulted in an expense of $9,570 and $36,832 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, recognized in the Company s compensation    expenses. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the expected forfeiture rate was 11.66%, which resulted in an expense of $8,423 and $16,004 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, recognized in the Company s compensation expenses. 
     
 35   

Table of Contents   
     
  The Company will continue to re-assess the impact of forfeitures if actual forfeitures increase in future quarters.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $1.3 million in cash and a working capital deficit of approximately $14.8 million, compared to approximately $2.6 million in cash and a working capital deficit of approximately $12.2 million as of December 31, 2015.  
     
  Based on the Company s current revenue and profit projections, management is uncertain that the Company s existing cash and accounts receivables will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months. If we do not meet our revenue and profit projections or the business climate turns negative, then we will need to:  
     
                                                raise additional funds to support the Company s operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise such additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing securities, existing stockholders may be diluted; and 
     
                                                review strategic alternatives. 
     
  If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The standard is intended to eliminate diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2017 and we are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  The amendments in the ASU eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years and should be applied prospectively upon the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

   In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.   This update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified statement of financial position.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  This update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred    tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.  Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period.  The Company adopted this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2015.  The effect of adopting the new guidance on the balance sheet was not significant. 
     
  In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  or ASU 2015-16. This amendment requires the acquirer in a business combination to recognize in the reporting period in which adjustment amounts are determined, any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-16, an acquirer was required to restate prior period financial statements as of the acquisition date for adjustments to provisional amounts.  The new standard for an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017 with an earlier effective application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The new guidance is not expected to have significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software; Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement . Prior to this ASU, U.S. GAAP did not include explicit guidance about a customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. Examples of cloud computing arrangements include software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and other similar hosting arrangements. This ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, in which case the customer should account for such license consistent with the acquisitions of other software licenses. If the cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The ASU does not change the accounting for service contracts. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-05 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs (ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs) , effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption of the new guidance is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new guidance will require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, consistent with debt discounts.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and as such, the debt issuance costs for Fortress note was presented in the balance sheet as direct deduction from the related debt liability.  
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard update provides guidance around management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new guidance is effective for all annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The new guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accountings Standards Board (  FASB  ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , or ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in US GAAP when it becomes effective and shall take effective on January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and the early application of the standard is not permitted. The Company is presently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and has not yet selected a transition method.  
     
  There were other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

   Results of Operations   
     
   For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
  We generated revenues of $43,113 and $36,452,551 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $6,407,997 and $11,870,851 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, this represented a decrease of $6,364,884 or 99% and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this represented an increase of $24,581,700 or 207%. On an absolute basis, revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily derived from the issuance of one-time patent licenses with a small amount of recurring royalties and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 revenue was derived from both the issuance of one-time patent licenses and recurring royalties.  The increase in revenue from 2015 to 2016 resulted from a number of larger one-time license agreements entered into by the Company s Dynamic Advances and Medtech subsidiaries.  
     
  Revenues from the issuance of one-time licenses to certain of the Company s patent portfolios accounted for approximately 0% and 99% of our revenues for the three months and nine ended September 30, 2016 and 97% and 94% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had no revenue from the issuance of one-time licenses, whereas revenues from the five largest settlement and license agreements accounted for 87% of the Company s revenue for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015.  
     
  While the Company added a number of patent portfolios during the periods ending June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, and the Company intends to move towards a recurring revenue model associated with the new, larger portfolios, the Company expects that until such transition is fully enacted that a significant portion of its revenues in the upcoming periods will be based on one-time grants of similar non-recurring, non-exclusive, non-assignable licenses to a relatively small number of entities and their affiliates. Further, with the expected small number of firms with which the Company enters into license agreements, and the amount and timing of such license agreements, the Company also expects that its revenues may be highly variable from one period to the next.  
     
  Direct cost of revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $1,094,378 and $19,202,118, respectively and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the direct cost of revenues amounted to $4,002,040 and $12,190,415, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, this represented a decrease of $2,907,661 or 73% and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this represented an increase of $7,011,703 or 58%. Direct costs of revenue include contingent payments to patent enforcement legal costs, patent enforcement advisors and inventors as well as various non-contingent costs associated with enforcing the Company s patent rights and otherwise in developing and entering into settlement and licensing agreements that generate the Company s revenue.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had no costs associated with contingent payments as there were no new licenses during this period.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had higher direct cost of revenus associated with contingent payments relative to new licenses issued as well as trial fees associated with the IP Liquidity portfolio. Direct cost of revenues were 2538% and 53%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and direct costs of revenues were 62% and 103%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2015.  
     
  We incurred other operating expenses of $9,688,527 and $18,884,827 for the three and nine months September 30, 2016, respectively and $5,491,363 and $17,632,070 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, this represented an increase in other operating expenses of $4,197,164 or 76% and $1,321,407 or 7%, respectively. These expenses primarily consisted of amortization of patents, general expenses, compensation to our officers, directors and employees, professional and consulting fees incurred in connection with the day-to-day operation of our business and patent and goodwill impairment charges.  The year over year increase in other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from patent impairment expenses in 2016; every other category of expense declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015.  
     
  The operating expenses consisted of the following:

Table of Contents   
     
  Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include non-cash operating expenses totaling $8,053,556 and $14,332,533, respectively, and for the three and nine month ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred non-cash operating expenses of $3,787,346 and $12,404,184, respectively. Non-cash operating expenses consisted of the following:  

(1)       
 
  Amortization of intangibles and   depreciation: Amortization expenses associated with patents and the Company s   website were $2,030,886 and $6,018,196 during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016, respectively, a decrease of $853,383 or 30% and $2,493,534   or 29% relative to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease results from the full impairment in four of the Company s   portfolios and the partial impairment of another of the Company s portfolios   during the intervening period of time. When the Company acquires patents and   patent rights, the Company capitalizes the cost of those assets and amortizes   those costs over the remaining useful lives of the assets. All patent   amortization expenses are non-cash expenses.           

(2)       
 
  Compensation expense and related   taxes: Compensation expense includes cash compensation and related payroll   taxes and benefits, and non-cash equity compensation expenses. For the three   months ended September 30, 2016, compensation expense and related payroll   taxes were $1,252,571, an increase of $348,886 or 39% and for the nine months   ended September 30, 2016, compensation expense and related payroll taxes   were 3,406,841, a decrease of 164,976 or 5% relative to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015. The increase in compensation for the three months   ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflects salaries associated with new   employees and the decrease in compensation expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016 primarily reflects bonuses incurred and paid during   the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We recognized non-cash   employee and board equity based compensation of $440,161 and $1,306,399,   respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $444,558 and $1,682,361, respectively, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015.           

(3)       
 
  Consulting fees: For the three   and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, we incurred   consulting fees of $257,420 and $903,032. This represented a decrease in the   amount of $386,283 or 60% and a decrease of $966,294 or 52% compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Consulting fees include   both cash and non-cash related consulting fees primarily for investor   relations, public relations and general consulting services.  The decrease during the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflect a decline in non-cash   equity compensation expenses associated with the engagement of numerous   consultants in the investor relations and for general consulting areas   incurred in 2015 that expired during 2015 and 2016. During the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized non-cash equity based   consulting expenses of $30,038 and $345,510, respectively compared to   non-cash equity-based consulting expenses of $448,361 and $1,403,555 for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.           

(4)       
 
  Professional fees:  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016, we incurred professional fees of $432,496 and   $1,336,201, respectively, a decrease of $449,717 or 51% and $894,547 or 40%   over the comparable periods in 2015.    Professional fees primarily reflect the costs of professional outside   accounting fees, legal fees and audit fees.    The decrease in professional fees for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016 over the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015 relate to lower professional outside legal,   accounting and audit fees resulting from the absence of significant costs   associated with closing the Fortress transaction and preparing for the   subsequently terminated Uniloc transaction. During the three and nine months   ended September 30, 2016, we recognized non-cash equity based   professional expenses of $8,620 and $25,707, respectively, compared to   non-cash professional expenses of $8,527 and $25,582, respectively, during   the same periods in 2015.           

(5)       
 
  Other general and administrative   expenses: For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we   incurred other general and administrative expenses of $183,773 and $612,284,   respectively, an increase of $6,277 or 4% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015, but a   decrease of $69,667 or 10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable period in 2015. General and administrative   expenses reflect the other non-categorized operating costs of the Company and   include expenses related to being a public company, rent, insurance,   technology and other expenses incurred to support the operations of the   Company. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we   recognized non-cash equity based other general and administrative expenses of   $12,468 and $28,448, respectively, compared to non-cash professional expenses   of $1,631 and $14,458, respectively, during the same periods in 2015.           

(6)       
 
  Goodwill impairment: Based on the   Company s determination that one of its portfolios had reached the end of its   useful life, the Company took an impairment charge during the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 in the carrying value of the related   goodwill in the amount of $0 and $83,000 compared to a goodwill impairment   charge in the amount of $0 and $766,498, respectively, during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015.           

(7)       
 
  Patent impairment: Based on   changes in the expected timing of proceeds from the Clouding portfolio, as   well as the determination that a number of the Company s portfolios had   reached the end of their useful lives, the Company took impairment charges for   three and nine months September 30, 2016 in the carrying value of the   Company s patents assets in the amount of $5,531,383 and 6,525,273,   respectively, compared to no impairment charges for three and nine months   September 30, 2015 in the carrying value of the Company s patents   assets.

   Operating Income (Loss)   
     
  We reported operating income (loss) of $(10,739,792) and $(1,634,394) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and operating income (loss) of $(3,085,406) and $(17,951,634), for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, this represented a decrease in operating income of $7,654,386, but for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, this represented an increased operating income of $16,317,240. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the increased income from operations was primarily attributable to higher revenue, lower direct cost of revenues and lower patent amortization costs.  
     
   Other Income (Expenses)   
     
  Total other income (expenses) was $1,093,278 and $(682,040) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $(1,148,877) and $(1,383,261) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, this represented an increase in other income of $2,242,155 and $701,221, respectively.  The principal component of the increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 was a decline in interest expenses, an increase in the gain associated with the change in the fair value of the Clouding IP earn out and a loss on debt extinguishment in 2015, offset by an increase in foreign exchange loss in 2016.  The principal component of the increase in other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 include the items set forth above as well, with the exception of the gain associated with the change in the fair value of the Clouding IP earn out, which was greater for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Income Tax Benefit (Expense)   
     
  We recognized an income tax benefit (expense) in the amount of $3,347,909 and $26,974 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, attributable to the Company s operating income in 2016, compared to the recognition of income tax benefits in the amounts of $483,815 and $6,300,159, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Net Income (Loss)   
     
  We reported net income (loss) of $(6,298,605) and $(2,289,460) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and net income (loss) of $(3,750,468) and $(13,034,736) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
   Non-GAAP Reconciliation   
     
  The Company recorded non-GAAP reconciliation items in the amount of $3,039,318 and $13,135,582 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to non-GAAP reconciliation items in the amount of $3,662,028 and $6,533,543 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The details of these non-GAAP reconciliation items are set forth below:

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2016, the Company s cash balances totaled $1,294,950 compared to $2,555,151 at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in the cash balances of $1,260,201 resulted primarily from net cash used in operations, acquisition of new patent portfolios and cash amortization of the Fortress debt.  
     
  Net working capital deficit declined by $2,619,870 to $14,792,616 at September 30, 2016 from $(12,172,746) at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in net working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in current assets related to cash from operations and an increase in current liabilities associated with an increase in the current portion of the Fortress debt.  
     
  Cash provided (used) in operating activities was $11,214,122 during the nine months ended September 30 2016 and cash provided (used) in operating activities was $(2,921,505) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  Cash provided (used) in investing activities was $(3,561,043) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $(22,520) cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The additional use of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was almost exclusively related to the acquisition of new patent portfolios.  
     
  Cash (used) in financing activities was $(8,981,688) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities in the amount of $1,266,251 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the repayment of all of the Medtech portfolio acquisition debt as well as a portion of the outstanding Fortress debt and cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted from the transaction entered into with Fortress on January 29, 2015, less repayment of general and patent portfolio acquisition debt, of equal or shorter terms, incurred during 2014.  
     
  Management is uncertain that the balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,294,950 at September 30, 2016 is sufficient to continue to fund the Company s operations through at least the next twelve months.  The Company s operations are subject to various risks and there is no assurance that changes in the operations of the Company will not require the Company to raise additional cash sooner than planned in order to continue uninterrupted operations.  In that event, the Company would seek to raise additional capital from the sale of the Company s securities, from borrowing or from other sources.  Should the Company seek to raise capital from the issuances of its securities, such transactions would be subject to the risks of the market for the Company s securities at the time.  
     
   Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
   We have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder s equity or that are not    reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity.

    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    
     
  We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  
     
  We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  ( Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to our limited internal audit function, our Disclosure Controls were not effective as of September 30, 2016, such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and out Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
     
  Management is in the process of determining how best to change our current system and implement a more effective system to insure that information required to be disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately. Our management acknowledges the existence of this problem, and intends to develop procedures to address them to the extent possible given limitations in financial and manpower resources. While management is working on a plan, no assurance can be made at this point that the implementation of such controls and procedures will be completed in a timely manner or that they will be adequate once implemented.  
     
    Changes in Internal Controls.    
     
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

   Item 1. Legal Proceedings.     
     
  In the ordinary course of business, we actively pursue legal remedies to enforce our intellectual property rights and to stop unauthorized use of our technology. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered beneficial shareholder, are adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to us.  
     
  In the normal course of our business of patent monetization, it is generally necessary for us to initiate litigation in order to commence the process of protecting our patent rights. Such litigation is expected to lead to a monetization event. Accordingly, we are, and in the future expect to become, a party to ongoing patent enforcement related litigation alleging infringement by various third parties of certain patented technologies owned and/or controlled by us. Litigation is commenced by and managed through the subsidiary that owns the related portfolio of patents or patent rights.

b)
