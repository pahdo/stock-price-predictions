              - 
    the impact of changing laws and regulations relating to air and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water emissions, waste management and other environmental matters, 
              - 
    risks associated with execution of our planned capital expenditure program, including timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction and expansion projects as well as the ability to complete planned construction projects within the terms and time frames anticipated, 
              - 
    cost, availability and timely provision of equipment, supplies, labor and fuel we need to operate our business, 
              -

following execution because of changes or adjustments in market pricing mechanisms by regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators,  
           - 
    reduced demand for coal-based energy because of actual or potential climate impacts and the development of alternate energy sources, 
              - 
    current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries, 
              -

              - 
    the failure of Great Plains Energy to obtain any financing necessary to complete the merger; 
              - 
    the outcome of any legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings or enforcement matters that have been or may be instituted in connection with the merger; 
              - 
    the receipt of an unsolicited offer from another party to acquire our assets or capital stock (or those of Great Plains Energy) that could interfere with the proposed merger; 
              - 
    the timing to consummate the proposed transaction; 
              - 
    disruption from the proposed transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees, regulators or suppliers; 
              - 
    the diversion of management time and attention on the transaction; 
              - 
    the amount of costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger; and 
              - 
    the effect and timing of changes in laws or in governmental regulations (including environmental laws and regulations) that could adversely affect our participation in the merger; and 
              - 
    other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (  2015   Form 10-K), including in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  and  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (2016 2Q Form 10-Q), including in  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  and  Item 1A. Risk Factors,  and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the proxy statement and other materials that we have filed or will file with the SEC in connection with the merger. 
       
  These lists are not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors.  This report should be read in its entirety and in conjunction with our   2015   Form 10-K and the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC.  No one section of this report deals with all aspects of the subject matter and additional information on some matters that could impact our consolidated financial results may be included in our   2015   Form 10-K or the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC.  The reader should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, as forward-looking statements speak only as of the date such statements were made.   We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement was made.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
    
  We are the largest electric utility in Kansas.  Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to  the Company,   we,   us,   our  and similar words are to Westar Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  The term  Westar Energy  refers to Westar Energy, Inc., a Kansas corporation incorporated in   1924  , alone and not together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  We provide electric generation, transmission and distribution services to approximately   704,000   customers in Kansas.  Westar Energy provides these services in central and northeastern Kansas, including the cities of Topeka, Lawrence, Manhattan, Salina and Hutchinson.  Kansas Gas and Electric Company (KGE), Westar Energy s wholly owned subsidiary, provides these services in south-central and southeastern Kansas, including the city of Wichita.  Both Westar Energy and KGE conduct business using the name Westar Energy.  Our corporate headquarters is located at 818 South Kansas Avenue, Topeka, Kansas 66612. 

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include all operating divisions, majority owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we maintain a controlling interest or are the primary beneficiary reported as a single reportable segment.  Undivided interests in jointly-owned generation facilities are included on a proportionate basis.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, have been included.   
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Use of Management s Estimates 
    
  When we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to depreciation, unbilled revenue, valuation of investments, forecasted fuel costs included in our retail energy cost adjustment (RECA) billed to customers, income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits, our asset retirement obligations including the decommissioning of Wolf Creek, environmental issues, VIEs, contingencies and litigation.  Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

Fuel Inventory and Supplies 
    
  We state fuel inventory and supplies at average cost.  Following are the balances for fuel inventory and supplies stated separately. 

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction 
    
  Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity.  We compute AFUDC by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress.  We credit other income (for equity funds) and interest expense (for borrowed funds) for the amount of AFUDC capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows: 

Earnings Per Share 
    
  We have participating securities in the form of unvested restricted share units (RSUs) with nonforfeitable rights to dividend equivalents that receive dividends on an equal basis with dividends declared on common shares.  As a result, we apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). 
    
  To compute basic EPS, we divide the earnings allocated to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS includes the effect of issuable common shares resulting from our forward sale agreements, if any, and RSUs with forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents.  We compute the dilutive effect of potential issuances of common shares using the treasury stock method.

To address current issues in accounting, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the following new accounting pronouncements which may affect our accounting and/or disclosure.

    In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  Among other clarifications, the guidance requires that cash proceeds received from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies be classified as cash inflows from investing activities and that cash payments for premiums on COLI policies may be classified as cash outflows for investing activities, operating activities or a combination of both.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  Retrospective application is required.  We are evaluating the guidance and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
    Stock-based Compensation 
    
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 as part of its simplification initiative.  The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We have elected to adopt effective January 1, 2016.    
       
  Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, if the tax deduction for a stock-based payment award exceeded the compensation cost recorded for financial reporting, the additional tax benefit was recognized in additional paid-in capital and referred to as an excess tax benefit.  Tax deficiencies were recognized either as an offset to the accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or as reduction of income.  The issuance of this ASU reflects the FASB s decision that all prospective excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be recognized as income tax benefits and expense.  Upon initial adoption, we recorded a   $3.3 million   cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for excess tax benefits that had not previously been recognized.  
    
  Further, the issuance of this ASU reflects the FASB s decision that cash flows related to excess tax benefits should be classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.  Upon adoption, we have retrospectively presented cash flows from operating activities on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as   $1.2 million   higher than as previously reported, and cash flows used in financing activities as   $1.2 million   higher than as previously reported.  
       
  Leases 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at present value of the lease payments, on its balance sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases are to be classified as either financing or operating leases, with that classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  Accounting for leases by lessors is largely unchanged.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The guidance requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at the earliest period presented, or entered into by the date of initial adoption, with certain practical expedients permitted.  We are evaluating the guidance and believe application of the guidance will result in an increase to our assets and liabilities on our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 
    
    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The measurement of expected losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We are evaluating the guidance and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements.    
    
  Financial Instruments - Net Asset Value 
    
    In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, which removes the requirement to categorize certain investments measured at net asset value (NAV) per share within the fair value hierarchy.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  We have adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2016.  The adoption was limited to disclosure and does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   See Note 5,  Financial Instruments and Trading Securities.  
       
    Revenue Recognition  
    
    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which addresses revenue from contracts with customers.  The objective of the new guidance is to establish principles to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with customers.  This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  However, in August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year.  Early application of the standard is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective application or cumulative effect transition method.  We are continuing to analyze the new standard and have not yet selected a transition method or determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements but we do not expect it to be material.

3. PENDING MERGER 
    
  On May 29, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy, a Missouri corporation, providing for the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy with and into Westar Energy, with Westar Energy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy.  At the closing of the merger, our shareholders will receive cash and shares of Great Plains Energy.  Each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, other than certain restricted shares, will be canceled and automatically converted into   $51.00   in cash, without interest, and a number of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock equal to an exchange ratio that may vary between   0.2709   and   0.3148  , based upon the volume-weighted average share price of Great Plains Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the   20   consecutive full trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the transaction.  Based on the closing price per share of Great Plains Energy common stock on the trading day prior to announcement of the merger, our shareholders would receive an implied   $60.00   for each share of Westar Energy common stock. 
  The closing of the merger is subject to customary conditions including, among others, receipt of required regulatory approvals.  On June 28, 2016, we and Great Plains Energy filed a joint application with the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) requesting approval of the merger.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the applicants, Kansas law imposes a   300  -day time limit on the KCC s review of the joint application.  On September 27, 2016, the KCC issued an order setting a procedural schedule for the application, with a KCC order date of April 24, 2017.  On October 18, 2016, the KCC issued an order stating that, if the KCC staff or other interested parties believe that the joint application does not adequately address the standards by which public utility mergers should be evaluated in Kansas, KCC staff or other interested parties should file for relief, including the potential dismissal of the joint application.   
  In addition, the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (Missouri Commission) opened an investigation to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the merger and on August 3, 2016, issued its order closing the investigation.  On October 11, 2016, a consumer group filed complaints against us and Great Plains Energy with the Missouri Commission seeking to have the Missouri Commission assert jurisdiction over the merger, and various parties have intervened in these complaints.  On October 12, 2016, and on October 26, 2016, the Missouri Commission staff and the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC), respectively, announced that each had entered into a Stipulation and Agreement with Great Plains Energy that, among other things, provided that Missouri Commission staff and the OPC would not file a complaint, or support another complaint, to assert that the Missouri Commission has jurisdiction over the merger.  The Stipulation and Agreements are subject to approval by the Missouri Commission, and the Missouri Commission has not ruled on the related consumer complaints.  If the Missouri Commission rejects the Stipulation and Agreement, or rules in favor of the consumer complaints, and determines that the Missouri Commission has jurisdiction over the merger, approval of the Missouri Commission also will be required in order to consummate the merger.  
  On July 11, 2016, we and Great Plains filed a joint application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requesting approval of the merger.  On July 22, 2016, Wolf Creek filed a request with the NRC to approve an indirect transfer of control of Wolf Creek s operating license.   
  On September 26, 2016, we and Great Plains Energy filed the antitrust notifications required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act) to complete the merger.  We and Great Plains Energy received early termination of the statutory waiting period under the HSR Act on October 21, 2016.  
  Also on September 26, 2016, the proposed merger was approved by our shareholders.  Concurrently, shareholders of Great Plains Energy approved various matters necessary for Great Plains Energy to complete the merger.   
  The merger agreement, which contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, may be terminated by either party if the merger has not occurred by May 31, 2017.  The termination date may be extended six months in order to obtain regulatory approvals.  If the merger agreement is terminated under these circumstances, including the failure to obtain regulatory approvals, Great Plains Energy must pay us a termination fee of   $380.0 million  .   
  The merger agreement also provides for certain other termination rights for both us and Great Plains Energy.  If (a) the merger agreement is terminated by either party because the end date occurred, or by us because Great Plains Energy is in breach of the merger agreement and (b) prior to such termination, an alternative acquisition proposal is made to Great Plains Energy or its board of directors or has been publicly disclosed and not withdrawn and within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement Great Plains Energy enters into an acquisition proposal, Great Plains Energy must pay us a termination fee of    $180.0 million  .  In addition, if either party terminates the merger agreement because the end date occurred, or if Great Plains Energy terminates the merger agreement because we are in breach of the merger agreement, and (a) prior to such termination, an alternative acquisition proposal is made to us or our board of directors or is publicly disclosed and not withdrawn, and (b)

     Table of Contents  

within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement or consummate a transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal, we must pay Great Plains Energy a termination fee of   $280.0 million  . 
  In connection with this transaction, we have incurred merger-related expenses.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred approximately   $1.9 million   and   $9.8 million  , respectively, of merger-related expenses, which are included in our selling, general, and administrative expenses.   We expect total merger-related expenses will be approximately   $30.0 million  , with the majority of the expenses to coincide with the closing of the merger.    
  We are currently involved in litigation relating to the merger.  See Note 11,  Commitments and Contingencies - Department of Justice Proceedings,  and Note 12,  Legal Proceedings,  for more information on legal matters.  

4.  RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION 
    
  KCC Proceedings 
    
  In October 2016, we filed an abbreviated rate review with the KCC to update our prices to include capital costs related to La Cygne Generating Station (La Cygne) environmental upgrades, investment to extend the life of Wolf Creek, costs related to programs to improve grid resiliency and costs associated with investments in other environmental projects during 2015.  If approved, we estimate that the new prices will increase our annual retail revenues by approximately   $17.4 million  .  The KCC is required to issue an order on our request within 240 days of our filing, which is in June 2017.  
    
  In December 2015, the KCC approved an order allowing us to adjust our prices to include costs incurred for property taxes.  The new prices were effective in January 2016 and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by approximately   $5.0 million  .  
    
  In June 2016, the KCC approved an order allowing us to adjust our retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the transmission formula rate (TFR), along with the reduced return on equity (ROE) as described below.  The updated prices were retroactively effective April 2016 and the estimated revenue impact for 2016, as compared to 2015, is expected to be an increase of approximately   $7.0 million  .  We have begun refunding our previously recorded refund obligation and as of September 30, 2016, we have a remaining refund obligation of   $2.7 million  , which is included in current regulatory liabilities on our balance sheet. 
    
  FERC Proceedings 
    
  Our TFR that includes projected 2017 transmission capital expenditures and operating costs will become effective in January 2017 and is expected to increase our annual transmission revenues by approximately   $29.6 million  . 
    
  In March 2016, the FERC approved a settlement reducing our base ROE used in determining our TFR.  The settlement results in an ROE of   10.3%  , which consists of a   9.8%   base ROE plus a   0.5%   incentive ROE for participation in an RTO.  The updated prices were retroactively effective January 2016 and the estimated revenue impact for 2016, as compared to 2015, is expected to be an increase of approximately   $24.0 million  .  This increase also reflects estimated recovery of increased transmission capital expenditures and operating costs.  We have begun refunding our previously recorded refund obligation and as of September 30, 2016, we have a remaining refund obligation of   $4.6 million  , which is included in current regulatory liabilities on our balance sheet.  

5.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADING SECURITIES 
    
  Values of Financial Instruments 
    
  GAAP establishes a hierarchical framework for disclosing the transparency of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.  In addition, we measure certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at NAV, which are not included in the fair value hierarchy.  Further explanation of these levels and NAV is summarized below. 

17 

     Table of Contents  

Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  The types of assets and liabilities included in level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on public exchanges. 

Level 2 - Pricing inputs are not quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable.  The types of assets and liabilities included in level 2 are typically liquid investments in funds which have a readily determinable fair value calculated using daily NAVs, other financial instruments that are comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or other financial instruments priced with models using highly observable inputs. 

Level 3 - Significant inputs to pricing have little or no transparency.  The types of assets and liabilities included in level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation. 

Net Asset Value - Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at NAV.  These investments do not consider the observability of inputs, therefore, they are not included within the fair value hierarchy.  We include in this category investments in private equity, real estate and alternative investment funds.  The underlying alternative investments include collateralized debt obligations, mezzanine debt and a variety of other investments.  

We record cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings and variable-rate debt on our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value.  We measure the fair value of fixed-rate debt, a level 2 measurement, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered for instruments of the same remaining maturities and redemption provisions.  The recorded amount of accounts receivable and other current financial instruments approximates fair value. 
    
  We measure fair value based on information available as of the measurement date.  The following table provides the carrying values and measured fair values of our fixed-rate debt.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following table provides the amounts and their corresponding level of hierarchy for our assets that are measured at fair value.

     Table of Contents  

Some of our investments in the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) are measured at NAV and do not have readily determinable fair values.  These investments are either with investment companies or companies that follow accounting guidance consistent with investment companies.  In certain situations, these investments may have redemption restrictions.  The following table provides additional information on these investments. 

_______________ 
           (a) 
    This investment is in four long-term private equity funds that do not permit early withdrawal.  Our investments in these funds cannot be distributed until the underlying investments have been liquidated, which may take years from the date of initial liquidation.  Two funds have begun to make distributions.  Our initial investment in the third fund occurred in the third quarter of 2013. Our initial investment in the fourth fund occurred in the second quarter of 2016.    The term of the third and fourth fund is   15   years, subject to the general partner s right to extend the term for up to three additional one-year periods.   
              (b) 
    There is a holdback on final redemptions.    
       
  Price Risk 
    
  We use various types of fuel, including coal, natural gas, uranium and diesel to operate our plants and also purchase power to meet customer demand.  Our prices and consolidated financial results are exposed to market risks from commodity price changes for electricity and other energy-related products as well as from interest rates.  Volatility in these markets impacts our costs of purchased power, costs of fuel for our generating plants and our participation in energy markets.  We strive to manage our customers  and our exposure to market risks through regulatory, operating and financing activities and, when we deem appropriate, we economically hedge a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments for non-trading purposes. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We have entered into numerous fixed and variable rate debt obligations.  We manage our interest rate risk related to these debt obligations by limiting our exposure to variable interest rate debt, diversifying maturity dates and entering into treasury yield hedge transactions.  We may also use other financial derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps.   

6.  FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS 
    
  We report our investments in equity and debt securities at fair value and use the specific identification method to determine their realized gains and losses.  We classify these investments as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities as described below. 
    
  Trading Securities 
    
  We hold equity and debt investments that we classify as trading securities in a trust used to fund certain retirement benefit obligations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we measured the fair value of trust assets at   $34.5 million   and   $33.9 million  , respectively.  We include unrealized gains or losses on these securities in investment earnings on our consolidated statements of income.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an unrealized gain of   $1.0 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, on assets still held.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded an unrealized loss of   $1.5 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, on assets still held.

     Table of Contents  

Available-for-Sale Securities 
    
  We hold investments in a trust for the purpose of funding the decommissioning of Wolf Creek.  We have classified these investments as available-for-sale and have recorded all such investments at their fair market value as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Using the specific identification method to determine cost, we realized   no   gains or losses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   a loss of     $1.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  We realized a loss of   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , and a loss of   $1.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  We record net realized and unrealized gains and losses in regulatory liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  This reporting is consistent with the method we use to account for the decommissioning costs we recover in our prices.  Gains or losses on assets in the trust fund are recorded as increases or decreases, respectively, to regulatory liabilities and could result in lower or higher funding requirements for decommissioning costs, which we believe would be reflected in the prices paid by our customers. 
    
  The following table presents the cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, fair value and allocation of investments in the NDT fund as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

The following table presents the fair value and the gross unrealized losses of the available-for-sale securities held in the NDT fund aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of     September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .    

7.  DEBT FINANCING 
    
  In June 2016, Westar Energy issued   $350.0 million   in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at   2.55%   and maturing July 2026. The bonds were issued as  Green Bonds,  and all proceeds from the bonds will be used for renewable energy projects, primarily the construction of the Western Plains Wind Farm. 
    
  Also in June 2016, KGE redeemed and reissued   $50.0 million   in principal amount of pollution control bonds maturing June 2031.  The stated rate of the bonds was reduced from   4.85%   to   2.50%  . 
    
  In February 2016, KGE, as lessee to the La Cygne sale-leaseback, effected a redemption and reissuance of   $162.1 million   in outstanding bonds maturing in March 2021.  The stated interest rate of the bonds was reduced from   5.647%   to   2.398%  .  See Note 13,  Variable Interest Entities,  for additional information regarding our La Cygne sale-leaseback. 

8.  TAXES 
    
  We recorded income tax expense of   $81.2 million   with an effective income tax rate of   34%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and income tax expense of   $66.3 million   with an effective income tax rate of   32%   for the same period of   2015  .  We recorded income tax expense of   $160.4 million   with an effective income tax rate of   35%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and income tax expense of   $127.8 million   with an effective income tax rate of   33%   for the same period of   2015  .  The increase in the effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , our unrecognized income tax benefits totaled   $2.2 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively.  We do not expect significant changes in our unrecognized income tax benefits in the next   12   months. 

22 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0.1 million   accrued for interest related to our unrecognized income tax benefits compared to   no   amount as of   December 31, 2015  .  We accrued   no   penalties at either   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had recorded   $1.5 million   for probable assessments of taxes other than income taxes.

  Environmental Matters 
    
  Cross-State Air Pollution Update Rule 
    
  In September 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Update Rule.  The final rule addresses interstate transport of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in 22 states including Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the ozone season and the impact from the formation of ozone on downwind states with respect to the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  Starting with the 2017 ozone season, the final rule will revise the existing ozone season allowance budgets for Missouri and Oklahoma and will establish an ozone season budget for Kansas.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the final rule on our operations, however, based on our initial analysis we do not believe this rule will have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results.  
    
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
    
  Under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA sets NAAQS for certain emissions known as the  criteria pollutants  considered harmful to public health and the environment, including two classes of particulate matter (PM), ozone, NOx (a precursor to ozone), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO   2   ), which result from fossil fuel combustion.  Areas meeting the NAAQS are designated attainment areas while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered nonattainment areas.  Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS.  NAAQS must be reviewed by the EPA at five-year intervals.  
    
  In October 2015, the EPA strengthened the ozone NAAQS by lowering the standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb.  In September 2016, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) recommended to the EPA that they designate the state of Kansas as in attainment or in attainment/unclassifiable with the standard.  The EPA is required to make attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards by October 2017.  If the EPA agrees with an attainment or attainment/unclassifiable designation for the state of Kansas, we do not believe this will have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.  
    
  In December 2012, the EPA strengthened an existing NAAQS for one class of PM.  In December 2014, the EPA designated the entire state of Kansas as unclassifiable/in attainment with the standard.  We do not believe this will have a material impact on our operations or consolidated financial results.  
    
  In 2010, the EPA revised the NAAQS for SO   2   .  In March 2015, a federal court approved a consent decree between the EPA and environmental groups.  The decree includes specific SO   2    emissions criteria for certain electric generating plants that, if met, required the EPA to promulgate attainment/nonattainment designations for areas surrounding these plants. Tecumseh Energy Center is our only generating station that meets this criteria.  In June 2016, the EPA accepted the State of Kansas recommendation to designate the areas surrounding the facility as unclassifiable, completing the second round of the designation process.  In addition, in June 2016, KDHE recommended a 2,000 ton per year limit for Tecumseh Energy Center Unit 7 in order to satisfy the requirements of the 1-hour SO   2    Data Requirements Rule which governs the next round of the designations.  By agreeing to the ton per year limitation, no further characterization of the area surrounding the plant is required.  We continue to communicate with our regulatory agencies regarding these standards and evaluate what impact the revised NAAQS could have on our operations and consolidated financial results.  If areas surrounding our facilities are designated in the future as nonattainment and/or we are required to install additional equipment to control emissions at our facilities, it could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results. 
    
  Greenhouse Gases 
    
  Burning coal and other fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) and other gases referred to as GHG.  Various regulations under the federal CAA limit CO   2    and other GHG emissions, and other measures are being imposed or offered by individual states, municipalities and regional agreements with the goal of reducing GHG emissions.

     Table of Contents  

In October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing new source performance standards that limit CO   2    emissions for new, modified and reconstructed coal and natural gas fueled electric generating units to various levels per Megawatt hour depending on various characteristics of the units.  Also in October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing guidelines for states to regulate CO   2    emissions from existing power plants.  The standards for existing plants are known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP).  Under the CPP, interim emissions performance rates must be achieved beginning in 2022 and final emissions performance rates must be achieved by 2030.  Legal challenges to the CPP were filed by groups of states and industry members, including our Company, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit beginning in October 2015.  In February 2016, after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied requests to stay the CPP, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting a stay of the rule pending resolution of the legal challenges.  In September 2016, oral arguments were heard before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review the CPP and to conduct the review en banc.  Despite the stay, the EPA issued a proposed rule formalizing the details of the CPP s Clean Energy Incentive Program.  Due to the future uncertainty of the CPP, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with the CPP could be material. 
    
  Water 
       
  We discharge some of the water used in our operations.  This water may contain substances deemed to be pollutants. Revised rules governing such discharges from coal-fired power plants were issued in November 2015.  The final rule establishes limitations or forces the elimination of wastewater associated with coal combustion residual handling.  Implementation timelines for these requirements will vary from 2019 to 2023.  We are evaluating the final rule at this time and cannot predict the resulting impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but believe costs to comply could be material.  
    
  In October 2014, the EPA s final standards for cooling intake structures at power plants to protect aquatic life took effect.  The standards, based on Section 316(b) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), require subject facilities to choose among seven best available technology options to reduce fish impingement.  In addition, some facilities must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms.  Our current analysis indicates this rule will not have a significant impact on our coal plants that employ cooling towers.  Biological monitoring may be required for La Cygne and Wolf Creek.  We are currently evaluating the rule s impact on those two plants and cannot predict the resulting impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we do not expect it to be material. 
    
  In June 2015, the EPA along with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule, effective August 2015, defining the Waters of the United States for purposes of the CWA.  This rulemaking has the potential to impact all programs under the CWA.  Expansion of regulated waterways is possible under the rule depending on regulating authority interpretation, which could impact several permitting programs.  Various states have filed lawsuits challenging the rule and, in October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order that temporarily stays implementation of the rule nationwide pending the outcome of the various legal challenges.  It is believed the stay will last into 2017.  We are currently evaluating the final rule.  We do not believe the rule will have a material impact on our operations or consolidated financial results.   
    
  Regulation of Coal Combustion Byproducts 
    
  In the course of operating our coal generation plants, we produce coal combustion byproducts (CCBs), including fly ash, gypsum and bottom ash.  We recycle some of our ash production, principally by selling to the aggregate industry.  The EPA published a rule to regulate CCBs in April 2015, which we believe will require additional CCB handling, processing and storage equipment and closure of certain ash disposal areas.  While we cannot at this time estimate the full impact and costs associated with future regulations of CCBs, we believe the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results could be material.  
    
  SPP Revenue Crediting 
    
  We are a member of the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) RTO, which coordinates the operation of a multi-state interconnected transmission system.  The SPP has been engaged in a process whereby it is seeking to allocate revenue credits under its Open Access Transmission Tariff to sponsors of certain transmission system upgrades.  Qualifying upgrades are those that are not financed through general rates paid by all customers and that result in additional revenue to the SPP.  The SPP has determined sponsors are entitled to revenue credits for previously completed upgrades, and members will be obligated to pay for revenue credits attributable to these historical upgrades.  

26 

     Table of Contents  

As a result, we expect to pay the SPP in November 2016 approximately   $7.0 million   related to revenue credits attributable to historical upgrades.  As of September 30, 2016, we have recorded a corresponding liability for our obligation to the SPP for the period of March 2008 to August 2016.  Most of the related charges will be recovered from our customers in future prices. 
    
  Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel  
    
  In 2010, the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its then pending application to construct a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  An NRC board denied the DOE s motion to withdraw its application and the DOE appealed that decision to the full NRC.  In 2011, the NRC issued an evenly split decision on the appeal and also ordered the licensing board to close out its work on the DOE s application by the end of 2011 due to a lack of funding.  These agency actions prompted the states of Washington and South Carolina, and a county in South Carolina, to file a lawsuit in a federal Court of Appeals asking the court to compel the NRC to resume its license review and to issue a decision on the license application.  In August 2013, the court ordered the NRC to resume its review of the DOE s application.  The NRC has not yet issued its decision.   
    
  Wolf Creek is currently evaluating alternatives for expanding its existing on-site spent nuclear fuel storage to provide additional capacity prior to 2025.  We cannot predict when, or if, an off-site storage site or alternative disposal site will be available to receive Wolf Creek s spent nuclear fuel and will continue to monitor this activity. 
    
  FERC Proceedings 
    
  See Note 4,  Rate Matters and Regulation - FERC Proceedings,  for information regarding a settlement of a complaint that was filed by the KCC against us with the FERC. 
    
  Department of Justice Proceedings 
    
  At any time before or after the merger, the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Federal Trade Commission could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Great Plains Energy, the Company or their respective subsidiaries.  Private parties and state attorneys general may also bring an action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.  On June 23, 2016, the DOJ sent a letter to us and Great Plains Energy informing the parties that it had opened an investigation into the proposed transaction and requested that the parties provide on a voluntary basis certain documents and information.   We and Great Plains Energy cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation, and on October 21, 2016, we were notified that the DOJ closed the investigation.  

12.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal, environmental and regulatory proceedings.  We believe that adequate provisions have been made and accordingly believe that the ultimate disposition of such matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial results.  See Note 4,  Rate Matters and Regulation,  and Note 11,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information. 
    
  Pending Merger 
    
  Following the announcement of the merger agreement, two putative class action complaints (which were consolidated and superseded by a consolidated complaint) and one putative derivative complaint challenging the merger were filed in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

The consolidated putative class action complaint, filed on July 25, 2016, is captioned In re Westar Energy, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Case No. 2016-CV-000457.  This complaint names as defendants Westar Energy, the members of our board of directors and Great Plains Energy.  The complaint asserts that the members of our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to our shareholders in connection with the proposed merger.  It also asserts that Westar Energy and Great Plains Energy aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duties.  The complaint alleges, among other things, that (i) the merger consideration deprives our shareholders of fair consideration for their shares, (ii) the merger agreement contains deal protection provisions that unfairly favor Great Plains Energy and discourage third parties from submitting potentially superior proposals, (iii) the disclosures are misleading and/or omit material information necessary for Westar Energy shareholders to make an informed decision whether to vote in favor of the proposed transaction and (iv) if the proposed transaction is consummated, certain of our directors and officers stand to receive significant benefits.  The complaint seeks, among other remedies, (i) injunctive relief enjoining the merger, (ii) rescission of the merger agreement or rescissory damages, (iii) a directive to members of our board of directors to account for all damages caused by them as a result of their breaches of their fiduciary duties and (iv) an award for costs and disbursements, including attorneys  fees and experts  fees.   
    
  The putative derivative complaint, filed on July 5, 2016 and as amended on August 25, 2016, is captioned Braunstein v. Chandler et al., Case No. 2016-CV-000502.  This putative derivative action names as defendants the members of our board of directors, Great Plains Energy and a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy, with Westar Energy named as a nominal defendant.  The complaint asserts that the members of our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to our shareholders in connection with the proposed merger.  It also asserts that Great Plains Energy and a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duties.  The complaint alleges, among other things, that the members of our board of directors failed to obtain the best possible price for our shareholders because of a flawed process that discouraged third parties from submitting potentially superior proposals, and that the disclosures are false or misleading due to the omission of certain information.  The complaint seeks, among other remedies, (i) a direction that the director defendants exercise their fiduciary duties to obtain a transaction which is in the best interests of us and our shareholders, (ii) a declaration that the proposed transaction was entered into in breach of the fiduciary duties of the defendants and is therefore unlawful and unenforceable, (iii) rescission of the merger agreement, (iv) the imposition of a constructive trust in favor of the plaintiff, on behalf of us, upon any benefits improperly received by the named defendants as a result of their wrongful conduct,  (v) award for costs, including attorneys  fees and experts  fees, and (vi) the imposition of an injunction against the defendants and others from consummating the merger on the terms proposed.  The defendants have moved for dismissal of this complaint. 
    
  On September 21, 2016, the parties in the consolidated putative class action and the putative derivative complaint independently agreed to withdraw requests for injunctive relief and otherwise agreed in principle to dismissing the actions with prejudice and to providing releases.  In exchange, the parties in the putative derivative complaint agreed that Westar would make supplemental disclosures to the shareholders, which disclosures were made in a Form 8-K filed on September 21, 2016, and the parties in the consolidated putative class action agreed that Westar Energy would (i) make the disclosures in the Form 8-K filed on September 21, 2016, and (ii) grant waivers of the prohibition on requesting a waiver of the standstill provisions in the confidentiality and standstill agreements executed by the bidders that participated in the Westar Energy sale process. These agreements do not constitute any admission by any of the defendants as to the merits of any claims.  In the future the parties will prepare and present to the court for approval Stipulations of Settlement that will, if accepted by the court, settle the actions in their entirety. 

13.  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  In determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we assess the entity s purpose and design, including the nature of the entity s activities and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders.  A reporting enterprise is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE.  The trusts holding our   8%   interest in Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) and our   50%   interest in La Cygne  unit 2 are VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary.  
    
  We assess all entities with which we become involved to determine whether such entities are VIEs and, if so, whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of the entities.  We also continuously assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs with which we are involved.  Prospective changes in facts and circumstances may cause us to reconsider our determination as it relates to the identification of the primary beneficiary.

     Table of Contents  

8%   Interest in Jeffrey Energy Center 
    
  Under an agreement that expires in   January 2019  , we lease an   8%   interest in JEC from a trust.  The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust.  The trust was created specifically to purchase the   8%   interest in JEC and lease it to a third party, and does not hold any other assets.  We meet the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust.  In determining the primary beneficiary of the trust, we concluded that the activities of the trust that most significantly impact its economic performance and that we have the power to direct include (1) the operation and maintenance of the   8%   interest in JEC, (2) our ability to exercise a purchase option at the end of the agreement at the lesser of fair value or a fixed amount and (3) our option to require refinancing of the trust s debt.  We have the potential to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant if the fair value of the   8%   interest in JEC at the end of the agreement is greater than the fixed amount.  The possibility of lower interest rates upon refinancing the debt also creates the potential for us to receive significant benefits. 
    
  50%   Interest in La Cygne Unit 2 
    
  Under an agreement that expires in   September 2029  , KGE entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a trust under which the trust purchased KGE s   50%   interest in La Cygne unit 2 and subsequently leased it back to KGE.  The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust.  The trust was created specifically to purchase the   50%   interest in La Cygne unit 2 and lease it back to KGE, and does not hold any other assets.  We meet the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust.  In determining the primary beneficiary of the trust, we concluded that the activities of the trust that most significantly impact its economic performance and that we have the power to direct include (1) the operation and maintenance of the   50%   interest in La Cygne unit 2 and (2) our ability to exercise a purchase option at the end of the agreement at the lesser of fair value or a fixed amount.  We have the potential to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant if the fair value of the   50%   interest in La Cygne unit 2 at the end of the agreement is greater than the fixed amount.  In February 2016, KGE effected a redemption and reissuance of the   $162.1 million   in outstanding bonds maturing March 2021.  See Note 7,  Debt Financing,  for additional information. 
    
  Financial Statement Impact 
    
  We have recorded the following assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets related to the VIEs described above. 

_______________ 
  (a)  Included in long-term regulatory assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  (b)  Included in accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  All of the liabilities noted in the table above relate to the purchase of the property, plant and equipment.  The assets of the VIEs can be used only to settle obligations of the VIEs and the VIEs  debt holders have no recourse to our general credit.  We have not provided financial or other support to the VIEs and are not required to provide such support.  We did   not   record any gain or loss upon initial consolidation of the VIEs.

INTRODUCTION 
    
  We are the largest electric utility in Kansas.  We produce, transmit and sell electricity at retail to customers in Kansas under the regulation of the KCC. We also supply electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in Kansas under the regulation of FERC.  We have contracts for the sale or purchase of wholesale electricity with other utilities.   
    
  In Management s Discussion and Analysis, we discuss our operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods of   2015  , our general financial condition and significant changes that occurred during   2016  .  As you read Management s Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which contain our operating results. 

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ITEMS 
    
  Proposed Merger with Great Plains Energy 
    
    On May 29, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy, a Missouri corporation, providing for the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy with and into Westar Energy, with Westar Energy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy.  At the closing of the merger, our shareholders will receive cash and shares of Great Plains Energy.  Each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, other than certain restricted shares, will be canceled and automatically converted into   $51.00   in cash, without interest, and a number of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock equal to an exchange ratio that may vary between   0.2709   and   0.3148  , based upon the volume-weighted average share price of Great Plains Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the   20   consecutive full trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the transaction.  Based on the closing price per share of Great Plains Energy common stock on the trading day prior to announcement of the merger, our shareholders would receive an implied   $60.00   for each share of Westar Energy common stock.  For more information, see Notes 3, 11 and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Pending Merger,   Commitments and Contingencies  and  Legal Proceedings,  respectively, and Item  1A. Risk Factors.  
    
  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Following is a summary of our net income and basic EPS.           

Net income and basic EPS increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to higher retail prices and to our having recorded more COLI proceeds.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $10.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, more in COLI proceeds. Offsetting these increases were merger-related expenses and our having recorded a $7.0 million liability related to SPP revenue crediting.  See the discussion under   Operating Results  below and Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies - SPP Revenue Crediting,  for additional information.

Current Trends 
    
  The following is an update to and is to be read in conjunction with  Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Environmental Regulation 
    
    We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  Environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations are overlapping, complex, subject to changes, have become more stringent over time and are expensive to implement.  There are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and consolidated financial results, including those relating to: 

further regulation of GHGs by the EPA, including regulations pursuant to the CPP and future legislation that could be proposed by the U.S. Congress; 
                
    various proposed and expected regulations governing air emissions including those relating to NAAQS (particularly those relating to PM, NOx, ozone, CO and SO   2   ); 
                
    the definition of Waters of the United States for purposes of the CWA; and, 
                
    the regulation of CCB. 
       
  See Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information on environmental matters. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management.  The policies highlighted in our   2015   Form 10-K have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change. 
    
  From   December 31, 2015  , through   September 30, 2016  , we did not experience any significant changes in our critical accounting estimates.  For additional information, see our   2015   Form 10-K.

Table of Contents  

OPERATING RESULTS 
    
  We evaluate operating results based on EPS.  We have various classifications of revenues, defined as follows: 
    
  Retail:    Sales of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers.  Classification of customers as residential, commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies.  Assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification. Other retail sales of electricity include lighting for public streets and highways, net of revenue subject to refund.   
    
  Wholesale:    Sales of electricity to electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric utilities and RTOs, the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by FERC authority.  Revenues from these sales are either included in the RECA or used in the determinations of base rates at the time of our next general rate review. 
    
  Transmission:    Reflects transmission revenues, including those based on tariffs with the SPP. 
    
  Other:    Miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others.  This category also includes transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets and fees we earn for services that we provide for third parties. 
    
  Electric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation, fuel costs, technology, customer behavior, the economy and competitive forces.  Changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal.  As a summer peaking utility, the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales.  Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers.  Mild weather reduces customer demand.  Our wholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.

Three and Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016  , Compared to   Three and Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
    
  Below we discuss our operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  Significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow. 

_______________ 
  (a) Change greater than 1,000%

     Table of Contents  

Gross Margin 
    
  Fuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs.  As permitted by regulators, we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power.  Fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by FERC.  As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income.  In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate due primarily to investments by us and other members of the SPP for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO.  As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices we charge customers with minimal impact on net income.  For these reasons, we believe gross margin is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next.  We calculate gross margin as total revenues, including transmission revenues, less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs.  Accordingly, gross margin reflects transmission revenues and costs on a net basis.  The following table summarizes our gross margin for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  No electricity sales are shown for transmission or other as they are not directly related to the amount of electricity we sell.    

Gross margin increased for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to higher retail prices, which increased approximately 6% and 5%, respectively.  Partially offsetting this increase for both periods was our having recorded a $7.0 million liability to the SPP.  See Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Commitments and Contingencies - SPP Revenue Crediting,  for additional information on this liability. Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, industrial sales were lower due to a few of our larger chemical and oil pipeline customers who experienced weaker global demand for their products.  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , there were approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, more cooling degree days.  The increase in cooling degree days during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was offset by milder winter weather during the beginning of the year, which resulted in approximately 12% fewer heating degree days.

     Table of Contents  

Income from operations, which is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, is the most directly comparable measure to our presentation of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations.  Additionally, our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  The following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Operating Expenses and Other Income and Expense Items 

Operating and maintenance expense increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to:  

higher distribution operating and maintenance costs of $3.9 million due partially to improving long-term reliability in 2016; and 
                
    higher operating and maintenance costs at our coal fired plants of $2.4 million, due primarily to scheduled outages; however, 
                
    partially offsetting these increases was a $4.2 million decrease in operating and maintenance costs related to retiring three generating units in late 2015. 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , due primarily to air quality control additions at La Cygne. 

35 

     Table of Contents  

Selling, general and administrative expense increased during nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to: 

an increase of $4.2 million in outside services related principally to technology services; however,  
                
    partially offsetting these increases was lower employee benefit costs of $4.5 million.  

Taxes other than income tax increased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , due primarily to increases of $10.6 million and $33.4 million, respectively, in property tax expense.  These increases are mostly offset in retail revenues. 

Other income increased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , due principally to increases in equity AFUDC of $2.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, and to our having recorded more in COLI benefits of $10.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively. 

Interest expense decreased for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to a $2.1 million increase in debt AFUDC and a $1.5 million decrease in interest expense on long-term debt of VIEs due to refinancing long-term debt of the La Cygne VIE.  
    
  Interest expense decreased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to a $6.5 million decrease in interest expense on long-term debt due to refinancing long-term debt, a $4.1 million decrease in interest on long-term debt of VIEs due to refinancing long-term debt of the La Cygne VIE and a $3.8 million increase in debt AFUDC.

Income tax expense increased for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , due principally to higher income before income taxes. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  A number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015  . 

Total regulatory assets decreased due primarily to the following items: 

a $26.4 million decrease in deferred employee benefit costs; 
                
    a $16.5 million decrease in amounts deferred for property taxes; 
                
    a $13.4 million decrease in amounts due from customers for future income taxes; and 
                
    a $4.8 million decrease in amounts deferred for Wolf Creek refueling and maintenance outages; however, 
                
    partially offsetting these decreases was a $17.6 million increase in amounts to be collected from our customers for the deferred cost of fuel and purchased power; and 
                
    a $5.6 million increase in unrecovered amounts related to the retirement of analog meters prior to the end of their remaining useful lives due to modernization of meter technology. 
       
  Total regulatory liabilities decreased due primarily to the following items: 
             
    spending $31.9 million more than collected for the cost to remove retired plant assets; and 
                
    a $12.7 million decrease in our refund obligations related to amounts we have collected from our customers in excess of our actual cost of fuel and purchased power; however, 
                
    partially offsetting these decreases was a $5.7 million increase in amounts recognized in setting our prices in excess of actual pension and post-retirement expense; and 
                
    a $4.6 million increase for the FERC settlement refund obligation and a $2.7 million increase for the KCC approved refund obligation related to the reduced ROE in our TFR.  See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Rate Matters and Regulation,  for a discussion of these refund obligations. 

Property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, increased due primarily to the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm and plant additions for capital improvements to improve long-term reliability.   

37 

     Table of Contents  

Short-term debt decreased due principally to Westar Energy issuing $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds, partially offset by issuances of commercial paper primarily used to fund capital expenditures, such as the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm.  See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt Financing.   

Total long-term debt increased due to Westar Energy issuing $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds.  See Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Debt Financing.   

Total long-term debt of variable interest entities decreased due to the VIEs that hold the JEC and La Cygne leasehold interests having made principal payments totaling $28.3 million. 

Deferred income taxes increased due primarily to the utilization of previously deferred net operating losses during the period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Overview 
    
  Available sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash, short-term borrowings under Westar Energy s commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities and access to capital markets.  We expect to meet our day-to-day cash requirements including, among other items, fuel and purchased power, dividends, interest payments, income taxes and pension contributions, using primarily internally generated cash and short-term borrowings.  To meet the cash requirements for our capital investments, we expect to use internally generated cash, short-term borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets.  When such balances are of sufficient size and it makes economic sense to do so, we also use proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities to repay short-term borrowings, which are principally related to investments in capital equipment and the redemption of bonds and for working capital and general corporate purposes.  Uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include, among others, factors affecting revenues described in   Operating Results  above, economic conditions, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets. 
    
  Short-Term Borrowings 
    
  Westar Energy maintains a commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $1.0 billion.  This program is supported by Westar Energy s revolving credit facilities.  Maturities of commercial paper issuances may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance and proceeds from such issuances will be used to temporarily fund capital expenditures, to redeem debt on an interim basis, for working capital and/or for other general corporate purposes.  As of   October 26, 2016  , Westar Energy had   $185.9 million   of commercial paper issued and outstanding.  
    
  Westar Energy has two revolving credit facilities in the amounts of   $730.0 million   and   $270.0 million  .  The   $730.0 million   facility will expire in September 2019, $20.7 million of which will expire in September 2017.  The   $270.0 million   credit facility will expire   February 2017  .  As long as there is no default under the facilities, the   $730.0 million   facility may be extended an additional year and the aggregate amount of borrowings under the   $730.0 million   and   $270.0 million   facilities may be increased to   $1.0 billion   and   $400.0 million  , respectively, subject to lender participation.  All borrowings under the facilities are secured by KGE first mortgage bonds.  Total combined borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program may not exceed   $1.0 billion   at any given time.  As of   October 26, 2016  , no amounts were borrowed and   $12.6 million   in letters of credit had been issued under the   $730.0 million   facility.  No amounts were borrowed and no letters of credit were issued under the   $270.0 million   facility as of the same date. 
    
  Long-Term Debt Financing 
    
  In June 2016, Westar Energy issued $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 2.55% and maturing July 2026. The bonds were issued as  Green Bonds,  and all proceeds from the bonds will be used for renewable energy projects, primarily the construction of the Western Plains Wind Farm. 
    
  Also in June 2016, KGE redeemed and reissued $50.0 million in principal amount of pollution control bonds maturing June 2031.  The stated rate of the bonds was reduced from 4.85% to 2.50%. 
    
  In February 2016, KGE, as lessee to the La Cygne sale-leaseback, effected a redemption and reissuance of $162.1 million in outstanding bonds maturing in March 2021.  The stated interest rate of the bonds was reduced from 5.647% to 2.398%.  See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Variable Interest Entities,  for additional information regarding our La Cygne sale-leaseback. 
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
    We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Impact of Credit Ratings on Debt Financing 
    
  Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard   Poor s Ratings Services (S P) are independent credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities.  These ratings indicate each agency s assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities. 

39 

     Table of Contents  

In general, more favorable credit ratings increase borrowing opportunities and reduce the cost of borrowing.  Under Westar Energy s revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, our cost of borrowings is determined in part by credit ratings.  However, Westar Energy s ability to borrow under the credit facilities and commercial paper program are not conditioned on maintaining a particular credit rating.  We may enter into new credit agreements that contain credit rating conditions, which could affect our liquidity and/or our borrowing costs. 
    
  Factors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria.  Objective criteria include typical financial ratios, such as funds from operations to total debt and operating cash flow to debt, among others, future capital expenditures and our access to liquidity including committed lines of credit.  Subjective criteria include such items as the quality and credibility of management, the political and regulatory environment we operate in and an assessment of our governance and risk management practices.   

As of   October 26, 2016  , our ratings with the agencies are as shown in the table below.

    In May 2016, following the public announcement of the proposed merger with Great Plains Energy, S P revised its outlook for Westar Energy and KGE to negative from stable. 
       
  Summary of Cash Flows 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities increased due principally to our having paid $98.5 million less for coal and natural gas, receiving $74.3 million more from retail customers, paying $26.7 million in 2015 for the Wolf Creek refueling outage and paying $22.9 million less for interest.  Partially offsetting these increases was our having received $36.2 million less for wholesale power sales     and transmission services, paying $12.9 million more in income tax payments and receiving $7.3 million less in COLI proceeds. 
  Cash Flows used in Investing Activities  
  Cash flows used in investing activities increased due primarily to our having invested   $335.4 million   more in additions to property, plant and equipment primarily related to the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm and our having received   $41.7 million   less from our investment in COLI.

     Table of Contents  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Cash flows from financing activities increased due principally to our having issued   $396.5 million   more in long-term debt, redeeming   $225.0 million   less in long-term debt, issuing   $162.0 million   more in long-term debt of VIEs and repaying   $41.0 million   less for borrowings against the cash surrender value of COLI.  Partially offsetting these increases was our having issued   $255.2 million   less in common stock, redeeming   $162.4 million   more in long-term debt of VIEs, issuing   $113.4 million   less in commercial paper, and paying   $15.2 million   more in dividends  
    
  Pension Contribution 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $15.7 million   to the Westar Energy pension trust.  We funded   $14.6 million   of Wolf Creek s pension plan contributions during the same period.  

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  From   December 31, 2015  , through   September 30, 2016  , our off-balance sheet arrangements did not change materially.  For additional information, see our   2015   Form 10-K. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 
    
  From   December 31, 2015  , through   September 30, 2016  , our contractual obligations and commercial commitments did not change materially outside the ordinary course of business.  For additional information, see our   2015   Form 10-K. 

OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Corporate-Owned Life Insurance

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.  In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Information on legal proceedings is set forth in Notes 4, 11 and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Rate Matters and Regulation,   Commitments and Contingencies  and  Legal Proceedings,  respectively, which are incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
    
       Our 2015 Form 10-K, as supplemented by our 2016 2Q Form 10-Q, contains descriptions of risk factors relating to us, as required by Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K.  The first, second and eighth risk factors included in the 2016 2Q Form 10-Q are replaced with the respective risk factors described below.  Except as indicated below, or as otherwise described in filings we make from time to time with the SEC, there were no material changes in our risk factors from   December 31, 2015  , through   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We cannot provide any assurance that the merger will be completed.  
  The closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) receipt of all required regulatory approvals, including from the FERC, the NRC and the KCC (provided that such approvals do not result in a material adverse effect on Great Plains Energy and its subsidiaries after giving effect to the merger), (ii) the absence of any law or judgment that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the closing of the merger, (iii) the effectiveness of the Great Plains Energy registration statement on Form S-4 that was filed with the SEC, (iv) the approval of the listing of the Great Plains Energy common stock to be issued in the merger, (v) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to us and our subsidiaries and (vi) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of, and compliance and covenants by, each of the parties to the merger agreement.  
  Although we and Great Plains Energy have agreed in the merger agreement to use our reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary to cause the conditions to the closing of the merger to be satisfied or to effect the closing of the merger as promptly as reasonably practicable, the conditions to the merger may not be satisfied and the merger agreement could be terminated. In addition, satisfying the conditions to the merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, we and Great Plains Energy expect.  The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination may adversely affect the benefits that we and Great Plains Energy expect to achieve from the merger and the trading price of our common stock. 
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

The merger is subject to the receipt of consent or approval from governmental entities that could delay the completion of the merger or impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company.  
  Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the applicable HSR Act waiting period and the receipt of consents, orders, approvals or clearances, as required, from, among others, the FERC, the NRC and the KCC (provided that such approvals do not result in a material adverse effect on Great Plains Energy and its subsidiaries after giving effect to the merger).  
  On June 28, 2016, we and Great Plains Energy filed a joint application with the KCC requesting approval of the merger.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the applicants, Kansas law imposes a 300-day time limit on the KCC s review of the joint application.  On September 27, 2016, KCC issued an order setting a procedural schedule for the application, with a KCC order date of April 24, 2017.  On October 18, 2016, the KCC issued an order stating that, if the KCC staff or other interested parties believe that the joint application does not adequately address the standards by which public utility mergers should be evaluated in Kansas, KCC staff or other interested parties should file for relief, including potential dismissal of the joint application.  We cannot predict if the KCC staff or another interested party will file for relief, or if so how the KCC will rule.  If the joint application is dismissed, we and Great Plains Energy would need to re-file the joint application and the timeframe for a decision by the KCC would restart. 
    
  In addition, the Missouri Commission opened an investigation to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the merger and on August 3, 2016, issued its order closing the investigation.  On October 11, 2016, a consumer group filed complaints against us and Great Plains Energy with the Missouri Commission seeking to have the Missouri Commission assert jurisdiction over the merger, and various parties have intervened in these complaints.  On October 12, 2016, and on October 26, 2016, the Missouri Commission staff and the OPC, respectively, announced that each had entered into a Stipulation and Agreement with Great Plains Energy that, among other things, provided that Missouri Commission staff and the OPC would not file a complaint, or support another complaint, to assert that the Missouri Commission has jurisdiction over the merger.  The Stipulation and Agreements are subject to approval by the Missouri Commission, and the Missouri Commission has not ruled on the related consumer complaints.  If the Missouri Commission rejects the Stipulation and Agreement, or rules in favor of the consumer complaints, and determines that the Missouri Commission has jurisdiction over the merger, approval of the Missouri Commission also will be required in order to consummate the merger.  
  A substantial delay in obtaining satisfactory approvals or the imposition of unfavorable terms or conditions in connection with such approvals could adversely affect the business, financial condition or results of operations of us or Great Plains Energy or may result in the termination of the merger agreement. 
  For additional information on the status of various approvals in connection with the pending merger, see Notes 3 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,  Pending Merger  and  Commitments and Contingencies,  respectively.   
  Pending litigation against us and Great Plains Energy may adversely affect the combined company s business, financial condition or results of operations following the merger.  
  Following the announcement of the merger agreement, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas, against Westar Energy, the members of our board of directors and Great Plains Energy, alleging breaches of various fiduciary duties by the members of our board of directors in connection with the proposed merger and alleging that we and Great Plains Energy aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.  A third putative derivative lawsuit was filed in the District Court of Shawnee County, Kansas, against the members of our board of directors, Great Plains Energy and a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy, alleging breaches of various fiduciary duties by members of our board of directors in connection with the proposed merger and alleging that Great Plains Energy and a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties.  Among other remedies, the plaintiffs in each case sought to enjoin the merger and rescind the merger agreement, in addition to certain unspecified damages and reimbursement of costs.  On September 21, 2016, the parties in the consolidated putative class action and the putative derivative complaint independently agreed to withdraw requests for injunctive relief and otherwise agreed in principle to dismissing the actions with prejudice and to providing releases.  In the future the parties will prepare and present to the court for approval Stipulations of Settlement that will, if accepted by the court, settle the actions in their entirety.   The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.  The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger closes may adversely affect the combined company s business, financial condition or results of operation.  See Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,  Legal Proceedings,  for additional information.

  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
  CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 
  SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, Mark A. Ruelle, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , of Westar Energy, Inc.; 
       
           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5.
