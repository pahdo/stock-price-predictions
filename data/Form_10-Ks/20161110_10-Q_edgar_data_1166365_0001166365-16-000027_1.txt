1.         BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments made for the fair statement of comprehensive   (  loss  ) income   for the three   and   nine     months ended   October     2  , 201  6   and   October     4  , 201  5  , the cash flows for the   nine   months ended   October     2  , 201  6   and   October     4  ,   201  5   and financial position at   October     2  , 201  6   and January   2  , 201  6   were normal recurring adjustments.   As disclosed   in Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )   2015-03,      Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ,    during   the first quarter of 2016. In accordance with the guidance, $8.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, associated with the Company s long-term debt, were reclassified from other assets, as previously reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 2, 2016, to long-term debt.    

These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes of Paperweight Development Corp. ( PDC ) and its   100%  -owned subsidiaries (collectively the  Company ), which includes Appvion, Inc. and its   100%  -owned subsidiaries (collectively  Appvion ) for each of the three years in the period ended January   2  , 201  6  , which are included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January   2, 2016  . The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of January   2  , 201  6  , contained within these condensed financial statements, was derived from the audited financial statements of PDC but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

2.        DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS    

On August 3, 2015,   Appvion completed the sale of the assets primarily used in the development, manufacture and sale of microencapsulation materials by the Encapsys segment of the Company (the  Encapsys Business ) to Rise Acquisition LLC ( Rise ), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Sherman Capital Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, for   an aggregate purchase price of   $208   million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments, and the assumption of certain liabilities (the  Sale ). Total working capital adjustments and cash expenses of the Sale were approximately   $7.5   million. Of the approximate   $200.5   million of net proceeds,   $165   million was used immediately to repay a portion of long-term debt. In addition, proceeds of   $35   million were set aside as restricted cash to be used within one year of this transaction for the specific purpose of capital investment and/or further debt reduction.       As of January 2, 2016,   Appvion had used this entire amount of restricted cash to repay an additional   $25   million in long-term debt and   $10   million for capital investment.   The estimated carrying value of the net assets sold was   $11.8   million.   The operating results for this business for the three   and nine   months ended   October     4  , 2015 have been reclassified and are now reported separately as discontinued operations. 

In connection with the Sale, Appvion and Rise entered into certain other agreements, including a Supply Agreement, by which Rise will supply Appvion with all of its microencapsulation product requirements for use in its carbonless paper products for a   ten  -year term subject to renewal, and a Transition Services Agreement, by which Appvion will provide certain transition services to Rise for up to three years following the closing date. Additionally, Appvion and Rise entered into a lease agreement, by which Appvion will lease a portion of its facilities in Appleton, Wisconsin to Rise for a three-year term, as well as a Patent License Agreement with respect to certain shared patents related to the Encapsys Business and Appvion s retained paper businesses.

3  .       ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION 

During June 2014, the Company entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a commitment size of   $30.0   million, whereby transactions under the program are accounted for as sales of trade receivables in accordance with ASC Topic 860,  Transfers and Servicing.  Sales of trade receivables under the program are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   October     2  , 2016 and January 2, 2016. Proceeds received, including collections on the deferred purchase price notes receivable, are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   October     2  , 2016 and   October     4  , 2015.  

Trade receivables sold to the third-party financial institution, and being serviced by Appvion, Inc., totaled   $33.6   million as of   October     2  , 2016, for which   $10.7   million in proceeds was received. Trade receivables sold to the third-party financial institution as of January 2, 2016 totaled   $36.9   million, for which   $18.1   million in proceeds was received. The fair value of the receivables sold equaled the carrying cost at the time of sale and no gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale. The fair value of the deferred purchase price notes receivable recorded as of   October     2  , 2016 was   $21.1   million and   $16.5   million as of year-end 2015 and is included in accounts receivable in the   Condensed   Consolidated Balance Sheet  s   as of   October     2  , 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of the deferred purchase price notes receivable using Level 3 inputs based on historical performance of similar receivables including an allowance for doubtful accounts, as well as estimated cash discounts to be taken by customers and potential credits issued to customers. The Company deems the interest rate risk related to the deferred purchase price notes to be de minimis primarily due to the short average collection cycle (  30   days) of the related receivables. 

Servicing fees paid for the program were   $0.1   million and   $0.4   million for the three- and   nine  -month periods ended   October 2, 2016, respectively, as well as for the three- and nine-month periods ended     October     4  , 2015  , respectively  .   Transaction costs of   $0.7   million, related to the June 2014 entry into this program, were deferred and recorded on the balance sheet as other long-term assets. They are being amortized over the three-year term of the securitization agreement  , ending June 2017  . The remaining balance at   October     2  , 2016 was   $0.2   million. 

4.       OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The Company s intangible assets consist of the following (dollars in thousands): 

Amortization expense of intangibles from continuing operations for the three   and   nine     months ended   October     2  , 2016 was $0.  6   million   and $1.  7   million, respectively  .   Amortization expense of intangible  s   from continuing operations for the three and   nine   months ended   October     4  , 2015 was $0.  6   million and $1.  7   million, respectively.

8  .       NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In August 2016,   the   Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )   issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  This guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  The Company is assessing the impact the guidance will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016,   FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This guidance simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.   This guidance can be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method.   The Company is assessing the impact the guidance will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.  This guidance clarifies   that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does n  ot, in and of itself, require de  designation of that hedging relationship provided all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The guidance must be applied using a prospective or modified retrospective application method and will be effective   for   fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.   The Company is assessing the impact the guidance will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This guidance provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model to apply in determining how and when to recognize revenue. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. When applying the new revenue model to contracts with customers, the guidance requires five steps to be applied which include: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also requires both quantitative and qualitative disclosures which are more comprehensive than existing revenue standards. The disclosures are intended to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flow. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations  to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  to clarify the guidance associated with identifying performance obligations and licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,  Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  to rescind specific guidance included in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas, effective upon adoption of Topic 606. Also in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  to address certain issues in the guidance regarding assessing collectability, presentation of state taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. These ASU s will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but no earlier than the original effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is assessing the impact the guidance will have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

The components of net periodic   benefit cost (gain)   associated with the defined benefit pension plans include the following (dollars in thousands): 

The Company does not expect to contribute any cash to its funded pension plan in 201  6  . 

Certain of the Company s hourly employees participated in a multi-employer defined benefit plan, the Pace Industry Union-Management Pension Plan (EIN #11-6166763). Participants in this plan included the West Carrollton, Ohio represented manufacturing employees, where   the   collective bargaining agreement expired on April 1, 2012. Participants also included the represented employees at the Kansas City, Kansas distribution center, where   the   collective bargaining agreement expired December 31, 2011. As a result of labor contracts ratified in June 2012 and September 2012, by the bargaining employees at the Kansas City, Kansas distribution center and West Carrollton, Ohio plant, respectively, both groups elected to end their participation in this multi-employer plan and instead participate in the defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company.     In addition, during first quarter 2012 there was a workforce reduction at the West Carrollton, Ohio plant resulting from the cessation of papermaking activities. As a result, the Company recorded   $25.0   million of expense in 2012 representing its estimated cost to satisfy a complete withdrawal liability under the terms of the plan s trust agreement, with a payment period that began January 2014 and could extend for up to   20   years, discounted   in   accordance with ASC Section 450-20-S99-1.   Payments of   $0.5   million and   $1.6   million were made during   third   quarter 2016 and the first   nine   months 2016, respectively, resulting in recorded interest expense of   $0.3   million and   $0.9   million for each of the two periods, respectively, and a   $0.7   million reduction of the reserve since year-end 2015. Of the   $22.7   million reserve,   $0.9   million is classified as short-term and   $21.8   million is classified as long-term within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   October     2  , 2016.

1  1  .      LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION       

In December 2001, the Company adopted the   Long-Term Stock Appreciation Rights Plan ( SAR  Plan)  . As of January   3, 2010, the Company adopted the Long-Term Restricted Stock Unit Plan   ("RSU"   Plan  ). Both plans utilize phantom units. The value of a unit in the   SAR Plan   is based on the change in the fair market value of PDC s common stock under the terms of the employee stock ownership plan (the  ESOP ) between the grant date and the exercise date. The value of a unit in the RSU   Plan   is based on the value of PDC common stock, as determined by the ESOP trustee. As of the end of   third   quarter 2016, the fair market value of one share of PDC common stock was   $13.70  .   

As of year-end 2015,   143,818   RSU units became vested and exercisable. In accordance with the RSU Plan, payment for these RSU s was made in February 2016. D  uring the   first nine months   of 2016,   130,8  50   additional units were granted under the   RSU P  lan.   Due to terminations of employment,   84  ,  14  0   unvested units were forfeited during th  e c  urrent   year  .    Additionally, 1  3  ,267 RSU units became vested and exercisable during third quarter 2016. Payment for 767 of these RSU units was made in third quarter 2016.     A balance of   2  62  ,  1  00   RSU units remains as of   October     2  , 2016.   Payment for the remaining 12,500 RSU units vesting during third quarter 2016 was made in October 2016.     Approximately   $0.1   million and     $0.8   million of expense  , related to this   RSU P  lan, was recorded during   each of   the three-   and nine-  month periods ended   October     2  , 2016  , respectively.   Approximately $0.2   million   and $1.2 million   of expense, related to this plan, was recorded during the three- and nine-month periods ended October 4, 2015, respectively.     As of   October     2  , 2016, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relating to unvested long-term restricted employee stock units was   $1.5   million. This amount is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of   2.0   years.    

During the first   nine   months of 2016,   310,150   additional units were granted under the   SAR P  lan.   Approximately $0.1 million of expense recovery   and $0.  5     million of expense, related to this plan, was recorded in both the three- and nine-month periods ended October 2, 2016, respectively.     Approximately $0.1 million and   $0.2   million of expense, related to this plan, was recorded in both the three- and nine-month periods ended October 4, 2015, respectively.

Lower Fox River 

Appvion Caps Potential Liability  .  On September 30, 2014, Appvion entered into a Funding Agreement with NCR Corporation ( NCR ), B.A.T. Industries, p.l.c. ( BAT ) and Windward Prospects Ltd ( Windward ) relating to clean-up costs for the Lower Fox River and certain potential future sites. Under the Funding Agreement, the parties paid the following amounts on September 30, 2014 toward historical Fox River Costs (as defined in the Funding Agreement) incurred by NCR through September 1, 2014:  BAT       $77.08   million; Windward       $10   million; and Appvion       $6   million.  In addition, BTI 2014 LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of BAT ( BTI ), is responsible for funding 50% of the Fox River Costs incurred by NCR after September 1, 2014.  The parties also agreed:  (a) to vigorously pursue reasonable and viable claims against certain third parties and to deposit any recoveries therefrom into BTI; and (b) that any funds remaining in BTI after paying BAT and NCR for any unreimbursed funding of Fox River Costs would be used to fund 60% of any Future Sites Costs, as defined in the Funding Agreement. 

Subject to the limitations described below, Appvion agreed to assume the following additional funding obligations under the Funding Agreement:  

(b) 

On September 1 of each year during the term of the Funding Agreement, the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate unreimbursed amount paid by BAT to the BTI for Fox River Costs (to the extent that Appvion has not previously paid such amount in any prior years) and (2) $7.5 million   ($7.5 million was paid on September 1, 2015)  ; and      

(c) 

On September 1 of each year during the term of the Funding Agreement, the lesser of (1) an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate amount paid by BAT to the BTI for Future Sites Costs (to the extent that Appvion has not previously paid such amount in prior years) and (2) $7.5 million.      

Effective August 31, 2016, the parties agreed that the amount due from Appvion on September 1, 2016, as set forth in (c) above would be separated into two payments: (i) $3.0 million, which was paid on September 1, 2016; and (ii) $4.5 million, which was subsequently paid on October 3, 2016. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Appvion s funding obligations are subject to the following limitations: 

(a) 

In no event will Appvion s funding obligations for Fox River Costs   exceed   $25   million (the  Appvion Fox River Cap );      

(b) 

In no event will Appvion s funding obligations for Future Sites Costs exceed   $25   million (the  Appvion Future Sites Cap ); and      

The parties to the Funding Agreement agree that they have no recourse against Appvion for any further liability relating to the Fox River or Future Sites beyond the Appvion Fox River Cap and the Appvion Future Sites Cap, respectively. 

Appvion bears sole responsibility for its funding obligations under the Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement does not, however, modify, alter or amend the two indemnification agreements entered into in 2001 wherein Windward agreed to indemnify PDC and PDC agreed to indemnify Appvion for certain costs, expenses and liabilities relating to Fox River and Future Sites, including Appvion s costs and expenses in negotiating and entering into the Funding Agreement and any future costs and expenses incurred by Appvion in pursuing recoveries.

As a result of the Funding Agreement,   $24.0   million of expense was recorded as selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the year ended January 3, 2015. This   expense   represents the total payments expected to be made with respect to Fox River costs, as discussed above, with the first payment made on September 30, 2014, the second payment made on February 2, 2015, the third payment   made on   September 1, 2015 and the last payment  s     made on   September 1, 2016   and October 3, 2016  , discounted to reflect the long  -term nature of the liability.   A short-term liability of   $  4.5   million is recorded in   the current portion of long-term debt     on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 2, 2016.

From time to time, the Company may be subject to various demands, claims, suits or other legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. A comprehensive insurance program is maintained to provide a measure of financial protection against such matters, though not all such exposures are, or can be, addressed by insurance. Estimated costs are recorded for such demands, claims, suits or proceedings of this nature when reasonably determinable. The Company has successfully defended such claims, settling some for amounts which are not material to the business and obtaining dismissals in others. While the Company will vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in any similar cases that may be brought against it in the future, there can be no assurance that it will be successful. 

The Company does not believe that any pending or threatened demands, claims, suits or other legal or regulatory proceedings will have, individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.

The Company s matching contributions charged to expense   were     $0.3   million   and   $0.4   million for   the three-month periods ended   October 2  , 201  6   an  d October 4, 2015, respectively. The Company s matching contributions charged to expense were   $1.2   million and   $1.5   million for the nine-month periods ended October 2, 2016 and October 4, 2015, respectively. As a result of hardship withdrawals, required diversifications and employee terminations,   477,175   shares of PDC redeemable common stock were repurchased during the first nine months of 2016 at an aggregate price of approximately   $6.1   million  .    During the same period, the ESOP trustee purchased   69,090   shares of PDC redeemable common stock for an aggregate price of   $0.9   million using pre-tax deferrals, rollovers and loan payments made by employees, while the Company s matching contributions for   the same period resulted in an additional   66,502   shares of redeemable common stock being issued.  

As a result of hardship withdrawals, required diversifications and employee terminations,   438,484   shares of PDC redeemable common stock were repurchased during the first nine months of 2015 at an aggregate price of approximately   $5.1   million. During the same period, the ESOP trustee purchased   96,574   shares of PDC redeemable common stock for an aggregate price of   $1.1   million using pre-tax deferrals, rollovers and loan payments made by employees, while the Company s matching contributions for the same period resulted in an additional   92,576   shares of redeemable common stock being issued. 

In accordance with ASC 480,  Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,    the appropriate accounting for redeemable equity first depends upon a determination of whether the equity is currently redeemabl  e or not currently redeemable.   Shares that are currently redeemable should be   recorded at redemption value.   For shares that are not currently redeemable, the accounting guidance allows for changes in redemption value to be accreted from the initial issuance date t  o the earliest redemption date.   This guidance also specifies that if the redemption value is less than the original issuance cost, the carrying amount of the redeemable common stock should not be less than the original issuance cost. 

As of   October 2, 2016  , the fair market value of one share of PDC common stock was   $13.70  .    Based   on the estimated fair value of the redeemable common stock at   October 2  , 201  6  , an ultimate redemption liability of approximately   $88   million was     determined. The redeemable common stock recorded book value as of   October 2  , 201  6  ,    was   $113   million.   The change in fair value and accretion of redeemable common stock was   $5.  1   million for the nine   months ended   October     2  , 2016. 

Based on the estimated fair value of the redeemable common stock at October 4, 2015, an ultimate redemption liability of approximately   $90   million was determined. The redeemable common stock recorded book value as of October 4, 2015 was   $121   million. The change in fair value and accretion of redeemable common stock was   $5.9   million for the nine months ended October 4, 2015.

1  4  .      DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

The Company selectively uses financial instruments to manage some market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The fair values of all derivatives are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The change in a derivative s fair value is recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. 

The Company selectively hedges forecasted transactions that are subject to foreign currency exchange exposure by using forward exchange contracts. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value using Level 2 observable market inputs. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward note, also deemed to be categorized as Level 2. The effective portion of the contracts  gains or losses due to changes in fair value is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the underlying transactions occur and affect earnings or if it becomes probable the forecasted transactions will not occur. These contracts are designed to hedge the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in curren  cy exchange rates. The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency transactions was     $9.5   million as of   October 2, 2016  . These contracts have settlement dates extending through   December 2016  . 

The Company selectively hedges forecasted commodity transactions that are subject to pricing fluctuations by using collar contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. These contracts are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value using Level 2 observable market inputs based on the New York Mercantile Exchange as measured on the last trading day of the accounting period and compared to the collar price. The contracts  gains or losses due to changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings.   As of January 2, 2016, all contracts have been settled.   At   October 4  ,    2  01  5  , the hedged volumes of these contracts totaled   280,909   MMBTU   (Million British Thermal Units) of natural gas.  

On July 30, 2013, Appvion entered into an interest rate swap contract on   $100   million of its variable rate first lien term loan with a forward start date of September 15, 2014 and a m  aturity date of June 28, 2019.   This interest rate swap pays the Company variable interest at the three-month   Eurodollar   rate or a fixed floor rate of   1.25%  , whichever is greater, and the Company pays the counterparty a fixed interest rate. The fixed   Eurodollar   interest rate for the contract is   7.24%  . Based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying debt, the interest rate contract was determined to be effective, and thus qualifies as a cash flow hedge. Any changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.

During the first   nine   months of 2016, the Company made mandatory debt repayments of   $1.2   million on its State of Ohio loans. The Company also borrowed   $271.4   million and repaid   $258.0   million on its revolving credit facility, leaving an outstanding balance at quarter-end of   $23.0   million. Approximately   $15.0   million of the revolving credit facility commitment was used in the form of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder, which, in accordance with its debt covenants, le  ft   approximately   $  6  .  6   million   of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn by beneficiaries under the outstanding letters of credit. 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a $4.5 million promissory note with NCR Corporation in relation to the Fox River Funding Agreement disclosed in Note 12. The unpaid principal balance of this Note bears interest at 6% per annum. Principal and interest were due and paid in full on October 3, 2016. 

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted   ASU 2015-03,    Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    In accordance with the guidance, $8.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, specifically attributable to each of the Company s long-term debt issues, were reclassified from other assets, as previously reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 2, 2016, to long-term debt.   The unamortized debt issuance costs are now presented as a direct deduction from each debt liability, consistent with the presentation of the corresponding debt discount, where applicable.  

On June 28, 2013, Appvion entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) providing for a   $100   million revolving line of credit due   June 28, 2018   and a   $335   million first lien term loan due   June 28, 2019  .    The Credit Agreement ranks senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Appvion and is secured by security interests in substantially all of the property and assets of Appvion and the debt guarantors. As noted above, the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is June 28, 2018 and the maturity date of the first lien term loan is June 28, 2019. The Credit Agreement is unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by PDC  ,    Appvion Canada, Ltd  . and APVN Holdings LLC.   It contains covenants customary for similar credit facilities. Affirmative and negative covenants under the Credit Agreement restrict Appvion s ability and the ability of Appvion s subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness and liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make investments, make loans and advances, transact certain asset sales, engage in mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, pay dividends or make other payments in respect of equity interests and other restricted payments, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, limit capital expenditures and make prepayments, redemptions and repurchases of other indebtedness. 

After giving effect to the Third Amendment, (as defined below), the total amount committed under the revolving line of credit was reduced to   $75   million and $170 million of the first lien term loan was repaid using proceeds from the   S  ale of the Encapsys   B  usiness. The first lien term loan bears interest, (i) through Appvion s 2015 fiscal year, at Appvion s option at either base rate plus   3.5%   per annum or Eurodollar plus   4.5%   per annum and (ii) thereafter, at either base rate or Eurodollar with the applicable margin determined pursuant to a pricing grid which provides that (x) if the reported consolidated first lien leverage ratio is greater than   3.00   to 1.00, the applicable margin on Eurodollar loans increases from 4.5% per annum to   5.0%   per annum and the applicable margin on base rate loans increases from 3.5% per annum to   4.0%   per annum and (y) if the reported consolidated first lien leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin on Eurodollar loans returns to 4.5% per annum and the applicable margin on base rate loans returns to 3.5% per annum. The Credit Agreement provides for a fixed floor rate of   1.25%   for Eurodollar loans and   2.25%   for base rate loans. On July 30, 2013, Appvion fixed the interest rate at   7.24%   on   $100.0   million of   the first lien term loan   using an interest rate swap contract with a forward start date of September 15, 2014 and a maturity date of June 28, 2019. Within five business days after the year-end financial statements have been filed, Appvion is required to prepay an aggregate principal amount of the term loan equal to the excess, if any, of (a)   50%   of defined excess cash flow, provided that such percentage shall be reduced to (1)   25%   based upon Appvion achieving a consolidated leverage ratio of less than   3.5   to 1.0 but greater than or equal to   2.5   to 1.0 and (2)   0%   based upon Appvion achieving a consolidated leverage ratio of less than   2.5   to 1.0 minus (b) the aggregate amount of all prepayments of the revolving credit line which constitute permanent reductions of the revolving credit facility and all optional prepayments of the first lien term loan made during the year.

On August 3, 2015, Appvion, P  DC,   Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent,   Fifth Third Bank, as revolver agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the   lenders   party to   the Credit Agreement entered into a Third Amendment (the  Third Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment became effective simultaneously with the closing of the Sale of the Encapsys Business. Upon its effectiveness, the Third Amendment, among other things, (i) permitted the Company to consummate the Sale of the Encapsys Business and provided for the corresponding release of liens on the Encapsys Business, (ii) required that not less than $165 million of the net proceeds be applied to prepay the revolving credit loans and the term loans under the Credit Agreement and provided that the remainder of the net proceeds be reinvested or otherwise applied to further prepay indebtedness in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (iii) provided for a permanent reduction of the revolving credit facility commitments from   $100   million   to   $75   million  , (iv) required the payment of a consent fee equal to   0.175%   of the aggregate principal amount of loans and commitments, (v) added the pricing grid discussed above and (vi) further conformed certain terms and covenants under the Credit Agreement to account for the Sale of the Encapsys Business and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Third Amendment also removed the maximum consolidated leverage covenant and added (i) a maximum consolidated first lien leverage covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated first lien leverage ratio, initially, of not more than   3.50   to 1.00, and on and after the third fiscal quarter of 2016, of not more than   3.25   to 1.00 and on and after the third fiscal quarter of 2017, of not more than   3.00   to 1.00 and (ii) a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, initially, of not less than   0.95   to 1.00 and on and after the first fiscal quarter of 2016, of not less than   1.00   to 1.00.

On November 19, 2013, Appvion completed a voluntary refinancing of a portion of its debt to extend maturities and reduce interest expense. The refinancing included the issuance of   $250   million in aggregate principal amount of second lien senior secured notes carrying an annual interest rate of   9.0%  , payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The notes will mature on June 1, 2020 and are unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by PDC and Appvion Canada, Ltd. The notes are secured by a second-priority security interest in substantially all of the property and assets of Appvion and the debt guarantors. These liens are junior in priority to the liens on this same collateral securing the outstanding debt incurred under the Credit Agreement. The notes contain covenants customary for similar debt which restrict Appvion s ability, as well as the ability of the guarantors, to sell or lease certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies, incur additional debt or issue preferred shares, incur liens, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, place restrictions on the ability of certain of Appvion s subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments to Appvion, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, amend particular agreements relating to Appvion s transaction with its former parent   Windward Prospects Ltd.   and the ESOP and enter into transactions with certain affiliates.

Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Unless stated to the contrary or the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the Company refer to Paperweight Development Corp. ( PDC  or  Paperweight ) and its 100%-owned subsidiaries. It includes Appvion, Inc. and its 100%-owned subsidiaries (collectively  Appvion ). 

Overview 

This discussion summarizes significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial position and liquidity of PDC for the quarter ended October 2, 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Reference should also be made to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2016, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included therein. 

Financial Highlights 

Third quarter 2016 net sales of $169.2 million were $11.4 million, or 6.3%, lower than third quarter 2015 net sales of $180.6 million largely due to lower shipment volumes and slightly lower product pricing. Shipment volumes were approximately 6% lower than those for third quarter 2015. Current quarter thermal papers net sales of $101.6 million were $2.2 million higher with shipment volumes down 2% versus the same period of 2015. Third quarter carbonless papers sales of $67.6 million were $13.6 million lower with shipment volumes approximately   11% lower than third quarter 2015. 

Third quarter 2016 gross profit of $29.3 million was $3.6 million lower than third quarter 2015 and current quarter gross margin decreased to 17.3% from an 18.2% margin for the same period last year. The decrease was largely due to lower pricing in the carbonless papers segment that was somewhat offset by improved pricing for thermal receipt paper, lower raw material costs and   c  ontinued execution of cost-savings initiatives. Current quarter selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses were $2.8 million, or 9.8%, lower than the same quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower distribution costs, lower compensation costs and lower bad debt expense  . 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $7.2 million compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $11.0 million in third quarter 2015. Current quarter results include a $0.9 million decrease in interest expense.

Comparison of Unaudited Results of Operations for the Quarters Ended October 2, 2016 and October 4, 2015 

Net sales for third quarter 2016 were $169.2 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 6.3%, compared to the   same period of the   prior year. Shipment volumes were approximately 6% lower than third quarter 2015. Current quarter thermal papers net sales of $101.6 million were $2.2 million higher with shipment volumes 2% lower than the   same period of the   prior year. Third quarter carbonless papers sales of $67.6 million were $13.6 million lower with shipment volumes approximately 11% lower than third quarter 2015. 

Third quarter 2016 operating income of $3.4 million compared to operating income of $4.2 million in third quarter 2015. This decrease in earnings was largely due to lower volumes   and   pricing in the carbonless papers   segment     as well as $2.1 million of consulting fees in the quarter.  This was   somewhat offset by improved pricing   for   thermal   receipt   papers, lower raw material costs and continued exe  cution of cost-  savings initiatives. Current quarter SG A expenses were $2.8 million, or 9.8%, lower than the   same period of the   previous year primarily due to lower distribution costs, lower compensation costs and lower bad debt expense.

Comparison of Unaudited Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended October 2, 2016 and October 4, 2015 

Year-to-date 2016 net sales of $523.3 million were $7.3 million, or 1.4%, lower than net sales of $530.6 million recorded during the first nine months of 2015. Current year-to-date shipment volumes were nearly 3% lower than in 2015. Net sales of $304.3 million recorded for the Company s thermal papers segment year-to-date were up $27.3 million, or 9.9%, while shipment volumes were approximately 6% higher than the same period of the prior year. Current year-to-date carbonless paper business net sales of $219.0 million were down $34.6 million, or 13.6%, with shipment volumes approximately 12% lower than the same period in 2015. 

The Company recorded operating income of $16.9 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to operating income of $7.0 million for the same period last year. Favorable pricing and product mix in the thermal papers segment and lower spending associated with annual maintenance downtime taken at the Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania mill, as well as continued improvements in operating performance and execution of cost-savings   initiatives, contributed to the year-over-year improvement. Year-to-date SG A expenses were $6.6 million, or 7.7%, lower when compared to the same period in 2015 largely due to lower distribution costs and compensation expense. This was offset by $3.4 million of consulting fees paid year-to-date as well as $3.0 million mark-to-market variance, year-over-year, associated with the retiree benefit plan versus the prior period. 

27   

The Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $14.5 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $35.4 million reported for the same period last year. In addition to the items noted above, year-to-date interest expense decreased $5.8 million to $30.6 million as the Company used proceeds from the third quarter 2015 sale of the Encapsys Business to repay $170.0 million of first lien term debt. Also during the first nine months of the current year, the Company recorded a foreign exchange gain of $0.2 million, compared to a $1.4 million loss in the prior year period, due to fluctuations in the Euro and Canadian dollar as they relate to the conversion of non-U.S. Dollar denominated receipts and net assets to U.S. Dollars. 

Business Segment Discussion 

Third quarter 2016 net sales were $169.2 million, $11.4 million lower than third quarter 2015 net sales of $180.6 million. Year-to-date 2016 net sales were $523.3 million, $7.3 million lower than 2015 net sales for the comparable period. Third quarter 2016 operating income of $3.4 million compared to a third quarter 2015 operating income of $4.2 million. Year-to-date 2016 operating income of $16.9 million compared to operating income of $7.0 million for the same period in 2015. The year-on-year operating income variance was the result of the following (dollars in millions): 

Thermal Papers 

Third quarter 2016 thermal papers net sales totaled $101.6 million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 2.2%, compared to the same period of the prior year while shipment volumes were 2% lower than in third quarter 2015.  Current quarter shipments of tag, label and entertainment papers ( TLE ) were approximately 14% higher than in third quarter 2015 and shipments of receipt paper declined approximately 20% compared to the same period last year. In addition, net sales benefited from favorable receipt paper pricing. The Company believes that third quarter 2015 marked the beginning of stabilization in the thermal papers markets with market share and pricing shifting to more historical levels as some competitors exited the market.     

During the first nine months of 2016, thermal papers net sales totaled $304.3 million, an increase of $27.3 million, or 9.9%, from the same period of the prior year. Year-to-date shipment volumes were approximately 6% higher than the same period last year with TLE volumes increasing approximately 12% while receipt paper volume was down approximately 1%. In addition, net sales also benefited from favorable receipt paper pricing as a result of the stabilization in market share and pricing shifting to more historical levels as some competitors exited the U.S. market in the third quarter 2015.     

The thermal papers segment recorded third quarter 2016 operating income of $2.5 million compared to a third quarter 2015 operating loss of $0.1 million. Slightly lower shipment volumes negatively impacted current quarter earnings by $0.6 million; however, that was more than offset by favorable pricing and product mix of $3.8 million. Continued improvements in operating performance and execution of cost savings initiatives, as well as lower SG A expenses and other spending, added $1.0 million to third quarter 2016 earnings when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, thermal papers had a $1.6 million mark-to-market unfavorable variance associated with the retiree benefit plan versus the prior period.     

28   

During the first nine months of 2016, the thermal papers segment recorded operating income of $11.3 million compared to an operating loss of $6.7 million for the same period last year. Current year-to-date earnings were $4.1 million higher due to increased shipment volumes. In addition, pricing and product mix were $9.0 million favorable, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency of $2.0 million. Continued improvements in operating performance and execution of cost  -  savings initiatives, as well as lower SG A   expenses   and other spending, added $7.9 million to year-to-date 2016 earnings when compared to the same period last year. In addition, thermal papers had a $1.0 million mark-to-market unfavorable variance associated with the retiree benefit plan versus the prior period.      

Carbonless Papers 

Third quarter 2016 carbonless net sales totaled $67.6 million, a decrease of $13.6 million, or 16.7%, from same period of the prior year. Current quarter shipment volumes were approximately 11% lower than third quarter 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, carbonless net sales totaled $219.0 million, a decrease of $34.6 million, or 13.6% from the same period in 2015. Year-to-date 2016 carbonless shipment volumes were down approximately 12% compared to the same period last year. Despite volume declines in this segment, specialty papers growth is gaining traction. Third quarter 2016 shipment volumes of specialty papers was nearly 28% higher than the same quarter last year while current year-to-date volumes are almost 15% higher than the first nine months of 2015.     

Third quarter 2016 carbonless papers recorded operating income of $3.9 million compared to operating income of $6.7 million reported in third quarter 2015. Current quarter earnings were $4.6 million lower due to reduced shipment volumes and $4.9 million unfavorable due to pricing and product mix. Continued improvements in operating performance and execution of cost-savings initiatives, as well as lower SG A expenses and other spending, added $9.4 million to third quarter 2016 earnings compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, carbonless papers had a $2.7 million unfavorable mark-to-market variance associated with the retiree benefit plans versus the prior period.     

During the first nine months of 2016, operating income of $13.2 million was reported compared to $21.7 million of operating income for the same period in 2015. Year-to-date earnings were $16.3 million lower   compared to the same period in 2015   due to reduced shipment volumes and $3.0 million unfavorable due to pricing and product mix and   the   unfavorable   impact of   foreign currency   exchanges that totals   $0.7 million.   Those factors were   somewhat offset by favorable year-to-date manufacturing operations of $9.0 million from continued improvements in operating performance, execution of cost  -  savings initiatives and lower spending associated with the annual maintenance downtime taken at the Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania mill. SG A   expenses   and other spending were lower by $4.3 million. In addition, carbonless papers had a $1.8 million unfavorable mark-to-market variance associated with the retiree benefit plan versus the prior period.     

Unallocated Corporate Charges 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview  .   The Company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided by operations and credit available under its revolving credit facility. The Company expects cash on hand, internally-generated cash flow and available credit from its revolving credit facility will provide the necessary funds for the reasonably foreseeable operating and recurring cash needs (e.g., working capital, debt service, other contractual obligations and capital expenditures). At October 2, 2016, the Company had $3.7 million of cash and, in accordance with its debt covenants, approximately $6.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. At that date, the revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of $23.0 million compared to $9.6 million at year-end 2015. Approximately $15.0 million of the revolving credit facility commitment was used in the form of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. Due to the required adoption of new accounting guidance, $8.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from other assets to long-term debt on the year-end 2015 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 2, 2016, resulting in restated net debt (total debt less cash) of $413.5 million. At the end of third quarter 2016, net debt was approximately $430.4 million. 

Management reported that the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants at October 2, 2016, and is forecasted to remain in compliance for the next 12 months. The Company s ability to comply with the financial covenants in the future depends on achieving forecasted operating results and operating cash flows. The Company s failure to comply with its covenants, or an assessment that it is likely to fail to comply with its covenants, could lead the Company to seek amendments to, or waivers of, the financial covenants. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain any such amendments to or waivers of the covenants. In the event of noncompliance with debt covenants, if the lenders will not amend or waive the Company s non-compliance with the covenants, the outstanding debt would become due and the Company would need to seek alternative financing. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would be able to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances. Failure to secure alternative financing would have a material adverse impact on the Company. 

29   

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  .   Net cash used by operating activities during the first nine months of 2016 was $1.1 million compared to $10.5 million of net cash used during the same period in 2015. In addition to a net loss of $14.5 million, noncash charges totaling $22.9 million were recorded. Noncash charges included $19.9 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, $0.3 million of foreign exchange gain, $1.2 million of noncash employer matching contributions to the KSOP and $2.1 million of other noncash charges. During the first nine months of 2016, working capital increased by $9.6 million. This was largely the result of a $7.8 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and     a $5.5 million increase in accounts receivable slightly offset by a $1.6 million decrease in inventory and a $2.1 million decrease in other current assets and liabilities.  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.     During the first nine months of 2016, $11.5 million of cash was used for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. During this same period last year, $183.6 million was provided by investing activities.  Of this, $12.6 million of cash was used for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and there was a $200.5 million increase to cash resulting from the sale of the Encapsys Business, of which, $4.3 million was restricted for the specific purpose of capital investment and/or further debt reduction within one year from the sale of Encapsys. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities.   Net cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2016 was $14.5 million compared to $173.5 million of cash used during the same period of the prior year. During the current period, the Company borrowed a net $13.4 million on its revolving credit facility. Also during the first nine months of 2016, the Company made mandatory debt repayments of $1.2 million on its State of Ohio loans. Current year proceeds from the issuance of PDC redeemable common stock totaled $0.9 million. The ESOP trustee purchased this stock using pre-tax deferrals, rollovers and loan payments made by employees during the first six months of 2016. Payments to redeem PDC stock were $6.1 million during this same period. In addition, cash overdrafts increased $7.7 million during the first nine months of 2016. Cash overdrafts represent short-term obligations, in excess of deposits on hand, which have not yet cleared through the banking system. Fluctuations in the balance are a function of quarter-end payment patterns and the speed with which the payees deposit the checks. During the first nine months of 2015, the Company repaid $172.5 million on its first lien term loan, largely using proceeds from the sale of its Encapsys Business.

Item 4 Cont    rols and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely discussion regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There   have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
