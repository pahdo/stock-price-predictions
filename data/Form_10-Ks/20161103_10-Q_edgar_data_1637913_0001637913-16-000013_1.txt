Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business.  You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  These statements may include words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   plan,   intend,   believe,   may,   should,   can have,   likely  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements we make regarding (1) our belief that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility and other foreign lines of credit will provide us adequate cash to fund the operating needs, working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other requirements for our business for the foreseeable future; (2) estimated capital expenditures for future periods; and (3) estimated cost savings and opportunities to drive margin improvements. 
    
  The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 2, 2016.  There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  
    
  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on these forward-looking statements. 
    
  Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speaks only as of the date on which we make it. Factors or events that could cause our actual operating and financial performance to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and for the 
     Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
   
  1. Background and Basis of Presentation 
  Milacron Holdings Corp. (the "Company" or "Milacron") is a global leader in the manufacture, distribution, and service of highly engineered and customized systems used in the plastic technology and processing industry. The Company has a full-line product portfolio that includes hot runner systems, injection molding, blow molding and extrusion equipment and produces process control systems, mold bases and components and maintenance, repair and operating ("MRO") supplies for plastic processing equipment and fluid technology. The Company operates throughout the world and is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for complete financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been made that are necessary for a fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the interim periods. The interim period results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 2, 2016. 
  Stock Split 
  The Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved a   106.3   for 1 stock split of the Company s common stock on   June 12, 2015  .  All common share and common per share amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to this stock split. 
  Initial Public Offering 
  On June 30, 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering ("IPO") whereby the Company sold   14,285,714   shares of common stock at a price of   $20.00   per share.  The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   June 25, 2015  .  The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the offering was approximately   $265 million  , net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.  The net proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness. 
  In July 2015, the Company's underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock.  The underwriters purchased   415,600   shares of the Company's common stock at the public offering price of $  20.00   per share, less the underwriting discount, and on July 29, 2015, the Company received $  7.8 million   in proceeds, net of the underwriting discount.  These net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . Topic 606, as further amended, affects virtually all aspects of an entity s revenue recognition, including determining the measurement of revenue and the timing of when it is recognized for the transfer of goods or services to customers. Topic 606 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the effect that the adoption will have on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be either classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 also requires significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019 with early adoption allowed and practical expedients to measure the effect of adoption also being allowed. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

  1.  Background and Basis of Presentation (continued) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows to reduce diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Reclassifications

  2. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued) 

Consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets subject to amortization was   $7.8 million   and   $8.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Consolidated amortization expense related to intangible assets subject to amortization was   $23.5 million   and   $27.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In connection with the Company's rebranding initiative and marketing strategy, the Company ceased utilizing certain trademarks within the Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies reportable segment during the second quarter of 2015. The Company concluded this was an indicator of impairment and the Company recognized an impairment charge of   $2.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which is included within other expense, net in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
   
  3. Income Taxes 
  An estimated annual effective tax rate is used to determine the quarterly provision for income taxes. The effective rate is based on various factors including expected annual income, statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, permanent items, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the ability to utilize tax credits and net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of tax positions are separately recognized in the quarter in which the underlying transaction or event occurs which causes variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter. 
  The effective rate for each period differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due to the mix of earnings by jurisdiction and the effect of transaction costs and business combination accounting adjustments that do not provide tax benefits. Since the Company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions at rates that are typically less than the U.S. statutory rate, the consolidated effective rate is typically lower than   35%  . The valuation allowances also cause volatility in the effective rate as they reduce deferred tax assets in jurisdictions which lack sufficient positive evidence regarding the ability to utilize the assets and no tax benefit or expense is recognized for losses or income incurred in those jurisdictions. 
  In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740 ("ASC 740"), the Company records interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions within income tax expense within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not have a material liability recorded for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for any period presented. 
  The utilization of the Company's NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation under the rules regarding a change in stock ownership as determined by the Internal Revenue Code, and state and foreign tax laws. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("Section 382"), as amended, imposes annual limitations on the utilization of NOL carryforwards, other tax carryforwards, and certain built-in losses upon an ownership change as defined under that section. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions that increase the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in the Company s stock by more than 50 percentage points over a three year testing period ("Section 382 Ownership Change"). If the Company has undergone a Section 382 Ownership Change, an annual limitation would be imposed on certain of the Company s tax attributes, including NOL and capital loss carryforwards, and certain other losses, credits, deductions or tax basis. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has determined that multiple ownership changes under Section 382 have occurred and that any limitations resulting from these ownership changes would not have a material impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, an agreement was reached with the tax authority at one of the Company s foreign jurisdictions.  Based upon the settlement, the Company concluded that a previously unrecognized tax benefit met the effective settlement criteria within ASC 740.  This settlement resulted in a   $15.7 million   reduction of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding deferred tax assets during the third quarter of 2016; thus, the settlement had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

4. Debt 
  Debt for the Company consists of the following: 

In March 2016, the Company repurchased approximately   $0.6 million   of the Company's outstanding   7.75%   senior unsecured notes on the open market at a discount to par. 
  On May 14, 2015, the Company entered into a new   $730.0 million   senior secured term loan facility with a maturity date of September 28, 2020 (the "New Term Loan Facility") and amended and restated the credit agreement governing the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Facility"), among other things, to conform certain terms in the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility to the terms contained in the credit agreement governing the New Term Loan Facility. The net proceeds from the New Term Loan Facility were used (i) to repay in full the   $339.1 million   principal amount outstanding under the Company's existing senior secured term loan facility due March 2020 (the "Term Loan Facility"), (ii) to redeem in full the   $220.0 million   aggregate principal amount outstanding of our   8.375%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the "Senior Secured Notes") on May 15, 2015 at a redemption price of   106.281%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including May 15, 2015 and (iii) to pay a cash dividend of approximately   $145 million   to the holders of the Company's common stock. 
  In connection with these transactions, the Company recognized an   $18.6 million   loss on the early extinguishment of debt which is classified within loss on debt extinguishment in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The loss on debt extinguishment includes a   $13.8 million   premium paid to redeem the Senior Secured Notes and the write-off of   $4.8 million   of deferred financing costs and debt discount associated with the Senior Secured Notes and the Term Loan Facility. The Company also capitalized an additional   $5.2 million   of deferred financing costs related to the issuance of the New Term Loan Facility which are being amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. 
  On June 30, 2015, in connection with the Company's completion of its IPO, the Company repaid   $248.0 million   of the principal amount outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility. As a result of this repayment, the Company recognized a   $3.6 million   loss on the early extinguishment of debt which is classified within loss on debt extinguishment in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
   
  5. Employee Benefit Plans 
  The Company sponsors   three   noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for certain non-U.S. employees and retirees.   One   plan covers certain employees in the United Kingdom and the other   two   plans cover certain employees in Germany. Net periodic pension expense was   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net periodic pension expense was   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net periodic pension expense is included in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

6. Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
  The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted net earnings (loss) per share (EPS) computations: 

The diluted EPS calculation for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   excludes the effect of   266,313   shares of restricted stock,   16,125   restricted stock units and   6,304,927   outstanding stock options as their effect is anti-dilutive. Holders of non-vested stock-based compensation awards do not have voting rights or rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the shares covered by the awards. 
   
  7. Stock-based Compensation 
  In connection with the cash dividend of approximately   $145 million   paid to the holders of the Company's common stock, as disclosed in Note 4, the Company made an adjustment to the exercise price of all stock options outstanding as of that date in accordance with the stock option agreements' original terms and conditions related to anti-dilution. The dividend,   $2.77   on a per share basis, reduced the exercise price of all outstanding options from   $9.41   to   $6.64   effective May 15, 2015. 
  The Company's Board of Directors adopted its 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) which became effective upon the pricing of the Company's IPO. The 2015 Plan allows for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company's common stock. On June 25, 2015, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted   1,260,567   stock options,   136,441   stock appreciation rights,   266,313   restricted stock awards and   16,125   restricted stock units under the 2015 Plan. The stock options, valued using a closed form option pricing model, and stock appreciation rights granted vest in equal annual increments over   four years  . The restricted stock awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and the restricted stock units vested on March 4, 2016,   two   business days after the public disclosure of the Company's financial results for fiscal year 2015. 
  As a result of the Company's completion of its IPO in June 2015, the Company recognized   $4.6 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with performance-based awards previously granted under the Company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. This cumulative catch-up was recognized once satisfaction of the performance condition within the rewards became probable. As the awards were still subject to a market condition, the performance-based awards were unvested as of June 30, 2015. In addition, the Company also recognized   $3.7 million   of stock-based compensation expense during the second quarter of 2015 related to outstanding stock appreciation rights which are recorded at fair value. 
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized   $11.3 million   of additional stock-based compensation expense related to time-based and performance-based awards previously granted to management personnel. These awards contained a market condition in which the vesting of awards was accelerated upon satisfaction of the market condition. Based upon the trading price of the Company's common stock subsequent to the IPO, the market condition was satisfied which resulted in the vesting of the awards in July 2015 and the Company's recognition of all previously unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with these awards.

8. Derivative Financial Instruments 
  In the normal course of business, including the purchasing of materials and selling of products, the Company is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations. The Company currently hedges its risk relative to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen for forecasted cash outflows denominated in these currencies. The Company had foreign currency forward contracts denominated in these currencies outstanding with notional amounts totaling   $9.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $10.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company s outstanding instruments mature within the next   3 months  . 
  The Company s derivative instruments discussed above are designated as cash flow hedges and the fair value of these derivative instruments was   $0.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $0.1 million   at   December 31, 2015   which is included in prepaid and other current assets in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  The following table provides the effect of the Company s designated cash flow hedges on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

All gains (losses) that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income (effective portion) are classified in (gain) loss on currency translation or cost of sales within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gain (loss) recognized related to the ineffective portion of the derivative instruments was immaterial for all periods presented.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a net gain of   $0.6 million   and a net loss of   $0.8 million  , respectively, related to the settlement of forward contracts which were designated as cash flow hedges. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a net gain of   $0.5 million   and a net loss of    $2.9 million  , respectively, related to the settlement of forward contracts which were designated as cash flow hedges. 
  The Company estimates fair value of its financial instruments utilizing an established three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date as follows: 
             
    Level 1 Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
                
    Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial statements. 
                
    Level 3 Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements.

  8. Derivative Financial Instruments (continued) 

The classification of fair value measurements within the established three-level hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to that measurement. The fair values of the Company s derivatives instruments were measured using valuations based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (Level 2) and are valued by reference to similar financial instruments, adjusted for terms specific to the contracts. There were no transfers between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during any period presented. The derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The Company also enters into derivative instruments (forwards) to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations in the Indian rupee. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized a loss of   $0.2 million   and a gain of   $0.1 million   related to the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments not designated as hedges, respectively. These gains and losses are recognized immediately within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and are classified within (gain) loss on currency translation. The fair value of these derivative instruments not designated as hedges at   September 30, 2016   was an asset of   $0.1 million  .

  2016 Actions 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Ferromatik Milacron GmbH entered into an agreement with its local works council setting forth a restructuring plan related to its manufacturing facility in Malterdingen, Germany whereby certain operational functions will be shifted to the Company's operations in the Czech Republic.  The Company expects to incur severance and other related costs of approximately   $13.0 million   to   $15.0 million  .  Substantially all of these costs will result in future cash expenditures and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2017.  As the employees are required to render service in order to receive the termination benefits, the associated liability will be recognized ratably over the future service period.  The impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of this expense recognition, was not material.  
  2015 Actions 
  The total remaining liability under severance-related actions taken during the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which is included within other current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, was   $0.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , and is expected to be substantially paid in cash by March 31, 2017. 
  In connection with the Company's organizational redesign initiatives in Europe, the Company has committed to a plan to sell   two   separate facilities,   one   located in Mechelen, Belgium and   one   located in Magenta, Italy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , both of these facilities met the held-for-sale criteria set forth in U.S. GAAP, resulting in the classification of   $9.7 million   of property and equipment as held-for-sale.    No   impairment was recognized during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the book value of the facilities is classified within prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Mechelen, Belgium facility is reported within the Melt Delivery and Control Systems segment and the Magenta, Italy facility is reported within the Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies segment. 
   
  12. Business Segment Information 
  The Company s operations are principally managed based upon the products that are produced and are comprised of   three   operating segments, which are the same as the Company s reportable segments: Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies, Melt Delivery and Control Systems, and Fluid Technologies. The factors for determining the Company s reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates performance combined with the nature of the individual business activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on net sales and operating earnings. Operating earnings includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segments. Operating earnings for each segment excludes items that are of a non-operating nature or are of a corporate or functional governance nature. Costs excluded from segment operating earnings include interest expense, income taxes and various corporate expenses such as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of certain businesses, stock-based compensation expense and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The effects of intersegment transactions have been eliminated. Effective January 1, 2016, the Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies segment includes our MPET product line that had previously been reported in the Melt Delivery and Control Systems segment. This reclassification more closely reflects the change in management of this product line and its related growth opportunities. Prior year results have been reclassified to reflect the segment change. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the MPET product line had revenue of   $2.0 million   and   $5.9 million   and operating earnings of   $0.3 million   and an operating loss of   $0.5 million  , respectively.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
  For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our results, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This management s discussion and analysis should also be read in conjunction with the management s discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC on March 2, 2016. 
  Overview 
  Milacron Holdings Corp. ("Milacron", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a global leader in the manufacture, distribution, and service of highly engineered and customized systems within the plastic technology and processing industry. We serve this market through the following three segments: 
             
    Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies ( APPT  
                
    Melt Delivery and Control Systems ( MDCS  and 
                
    Fluid Technologies ( Fluids ). 
     Our APPT segment designs, manufactures and sells plastic processing equipment and systems, which include injection molding, blow molding, extrusion and auxiliary systems along with the related parts and service, whereas our MDCS segment designs, manufactures and sells hot runner and process control systems, mold bases and components, and sells maintenance, repair and operating ( MRO ) supplies. Hot runner systems are custom-designed for each product a customer manufactures on an injection molding machine. Our Fluids segment is a global manufacturer of synthetic and semi-synthetic lubricants and coolants. 
  We are the only global company with a full-line product portfolio that includes hot runner systems, injection molding, blow molding and extrusion equipment. We maintain strong market positions across these products, as well as leading positions in process control systems, mold bases and components, MRO supplies and fluid technology. 
  Milacron has strong brand recognition with over 150 years of continuous operations. With products sold in over 100 countries across six continents, our established and market-driven global footprint is well-positioned to benefit from continued robust industry growth in both developed and emerging markets. Our breadth of products, long history, and global reach have resulted in a large installed base of over 40,000 plastic processing machines and over 140,000 hot runner systems. 
  Our strategy is designed to maximize revenue from consumable products across the life of a machine, while offering plastic technology solutions to a broad customer base. Management estimates that the value of available consumables revenue across the life of a machine is one to four times the cost of a machine. This strategy has shifted our revenue and earnings model to be more heavily weighted towards consumables, which comprise the majority of revenue from our plastic processing related APPT and MDCS segments on a combined basis. The consumables portion of our APPT and MDCS segments consists of: (1) machine aftermarket parts and service which are required annually, (2) hot runner systems and mold bases which are required each time new plastic parts are designed and existing plastic parts are redesigned, and (3) upgrades and overhauls which occur as customers decide to improve the performance or extend the life of their machines. Upon a customer s decision to replace a machine, we can repurchase the existing machine and sell it as a certified pre-owned machine. All of our sales in our Fluids segment are considered to be consumable and, when combined with our APPT and MDCS consumable product lines, consumables accounted for 61% of total fiscal 2015 sales and 62% of our sales for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We believe this percentage will increase as we capture more of our customers  spend on consumable products through our lifecycle sales approach. 
  We have over 27,000 customers globally, made up of many blue-chip and Fortune 500 companies including OEMs, molders and mold-makers. Our customer base covers a wide range of end market applications including packaging, automotive, medical, construction, consumer goods and electronics. Our sales are geographically diversified, with 55% in North America, 19% in Europe, 9% in China, 8% in India and 9% in the rest of the world for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Global population growth, coupled with continued urbanization, increased purchasing power and improved lifestyle in emerging markets has resulted in greater demand for a broad range of finished plastic products in many segments of the economy, including automotive, construction and consumer products. We believe that our strong global presence positions us well to capture a portion of this growth. Milacron has made significant investments in China and India in order to capitalize on the projected growth rates of the plastic business in these markets. We plan to continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities while also increasing our technical, marketing and sales efforts. In Central and South America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, we are building capabilities and working on creating new relationships to support this growth. We also continue to strategically reorganize our manufacturing base in order to shift resources to high growth geographic markets.

Key Drivers of our Businesses 
  Milacron s strategy is focused on growing revenue and operating profits through selective initiatives that leverage our market position, geographic footprint and core competencies. Management expects, in the near term, profitability will be driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion. Management expects that revenue growth will come from underlying market growth in our key segments, geographic expansion of certain product lines, continued penetration of hot runners, and incremental share gain from new products. New products are focused on solidifying our current market position, expanding our addressable market and expanding the market through the introduction of technology that displaces other materials, primarily metal and glass. Operating margin expansion is expected to result from active cost reduction initiatives focused on leveraging our geographic footprint that will allow us to consolidate manufacturing capacity, sales offices and call centers on a regional basis, and shift certain back-office functions from a decentralized local structure to a low-cost country global shared service center model. 
  Cost Reduction Initiatives 
  Milacron s organizational redesign and cost reduction initiatives are in the process of being implemented and are expected to yield approximately $35 million of annual run-rate cost savings by the end of 2017. In fiscal 2015, Milacron incurred approximately $22 million of one-time costs related to these projects and during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately $5.8 million and $14.7 million of costs were incurred related to these projects, respectively.  
  On September 30, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Ferromatik Milacron GmbH entered into an agreement with its local works council setting forth a restructuring plan related to its manufacturing facility in Malterdingen, Germany whereby certain operational functions will be shifted to the Company's operations in the Czech Republic.  The Company expects to incur severance and other related costs of approximately $13.0 million to $15.0 million.  Substantially all of these costs will result in future cash expenditures and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2017. 
  See risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 2, 2016.  
  Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies 
  The key factors affecting our APPT segment results include demand for plastic processing machinery, capacity and capital investment, raw material inputs and cost structure. 
  Demand.    Increased demand in the plastic processing machinery industry is expected to be driven by the overall expected rise in plastic processing, increasing equipment age and continuing advances in technology, such as the shift to higher-end equipment as plastic processors seek to reduce their operating costs and produce higher quality products. With 67% of APPT sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   occurring in North America, demand is also impacted by customers bringing manufacturing operations back to North America. 
  Capacity and Capital Investment.    Capital expenditures in our APPT business were $29.4 million in fiscal 2015, of which  approximately 58% related to capacity expansion for the production of plastic processing equipment, primarily in Europe to facilitate the announced move of our production facility in Italy to the Czech Republic. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , capital expenditures in APPT totaled   $16.8 million  , of which approximately 35% relates to capacity expansion for the production of plastic processing equipment.  
  Raw Material Inputs.    In order to secure our supply needs, we have developed a global network of reliable, low-cost suppliers. We sourced approximately 28% of our components and materials from suppliers located in low-cost countries in fiscal 2015 and are working toward increasing this percentage. Steel, which we source both directly and indirectly through our component suppliers, is the primary material used in our products. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge our commodity price risk and currently do not have a significant number of long-term supply contracts with key suppliers.  
  Cost Structure.    Our APPT segment is focused  on optimizing our global manufacturing and back-office infrastructure to maximize operating efficiencies and minimize fixed cost structure. 
  Melt Delivery and Control Systems 
  The key factors affecting our MDCS segment results include demand for hot runner systems and hot halves, mold bases, components, capacity and capital investment, raw material inputs and cost structure. 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Demand.   Consistent with historical periods, according to an October 2015 Interconnection Consulting report, the hot runner market is expected to grow faster than the overall global economy based on macro-economic drivers involving product life cycles, demographics, technology conversion and greater use of plastic. Demand within the hot runner market is driven more by the frequency of product design changes and model refreshes than by end product volume, because hot runner systems are typically custom ordered for each new product mold, representing a critical factor in the market s resiliency during economic cycles. 
  Capacity and Capital Investment.   Capital expenditures in our MDCS segment were $19.5 million in fiscal 2015, of which 25% was incurred to expand capacity in the Czech Republic, in part to facilitate the announced move of our Belgium warehouse to the Czech Republic. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , capital expenditures in MDCS totaled $  13.4 million  .  Approximately 38% of these capital expenditures are related to capacity expansion in China for the production of hot runner systems and related products and 27% is related to our continued expansion in the Czech Republic to consolidate manufacturing capacity. 
  Raw Material Inputs.   Steel is the primary raw material input for our MDCS segment. Although long-term contracts with steel suppliers are not typical, our business has purchase order commitments for a portion of our annual spend of higher-volume grades of steel. These purchase orders extend an average of three to six months, with prices negotiated annually. This allows us to forecast our costs in the MDCS segment and, given the short lead time between the initial request for a quotation and the finalized design, we have historically been able to pass along price changes, accordingly. 
  Cost Structure.   Our MDCS segment is focused on controlling its cost structure by increasing low-cost country sourcing in addition to establishing comprehensive operations in India for applications engineering and the consolidation of several back-office support functions within our shared services center. 
  Fluid Technologies 
  The key factors affecting our Fluids segment results include demand for metalworking fluids and raw material inputs. 
  Demand.   Demand for industrial fluids is closely tied to demand for metal products, which are produced on metalworking machinery through cutting, stamping and other processes. As industrial production and demand for metalworking machinery grows, manufacturers will require increased amounts of high-quality coolants, lubricants and cleaners to maximize productivity and extend the life of equipment and tooling. Market trends indicate higher technology fluids demand due to environmental and health concerns and as more exotic metals become more prevalent. 
  Raw Material Inputs.   Many of the raw materials in our industrial fluids are derivatives of petroleum or natural gas. As a result, fluctuations in commodity-based pricing may impact the cost of these materials. We manage the impact of raw material cost increases through sales pricing adjustments, but we may be impacted by a delay in implementing these adjustments throughout our distribution network. In addition, due to the specialty nature of our products, some of our raw materials have few sources, and we may be impacted by disruptions to supply. Where possible, we seek alternative sources and, in some situations, we are able to reformulate product with alternative materials without impacting performance, environmental, or health and safety features. 
   
  New Orders and Backlog 
  New orders represent the value of incoming purchase orders received for a period of time that may or may not have been shipped during the period. New orders in the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $284.3 million  , an increase of   $9.1 million  , or   3.3%  , compared to   $275.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Excluding   $2.7 million   of unfavorable effects of foreign currency movements, new orders increased   4.3%   compared to the prior year period. New orders were primarily impacted by an increase in our equipment business in Europe and our hot runner business in Europe and China. New orders were also impacted   $5.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from the acquisition of CanGen Holdings, Inc. ("CanGen") during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  New orders in the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $900.2 million  , an increase of   $24.5 million  , or   2.8%  , compared to   $875.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Excluding   $13.2 million   of unfavorable effects of foreign currency movements, new orders increased   4.3%   compared to the prior year period. New orders were primarily impacted by an increase in our equipment business in North America and Europe as well as our hot runner business in China. New orders were also impacted   $16.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   from the acquisition of CanGen during the fourth quarter of 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Backlog represents the value of unfilled orders as of the applicable date. These unfilled orders are supported by a valid purchase order and price, terms and credit have been approved by us. Our backlog of unfilled orders at   September 30, 2016   was   $243.3 million  , an increase of   $31.7 million   from   December 31, 2015   and an increase of   $22.5 million   from   September 30, 2015  . Excluding   $2.0 million   of favorable effects of foreign currency movements, backlog increased   14.0%   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in our backlog compared to   December 31, 2015   is predominantly driven by strength in the North American equipment business. Excluding   $0.2 million   of unfavorable effects of foreign currency movements, backlog increased   10.3%   compared to   September 30, 2015  . Backlog was also impacted   $5.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   from the acquisition of CanGen when compared to   September 30, 2015  . All of our backlog is expected to be filled within the next twelve months and there are no seasonal or other aspects of the backlog that would impact filling the orders.   
  Backlog of confirmed orders for equipment within the APPT business is tracked on a monthly basis. Lead times can vary significantly depending on the type and size of machine. Backlog within our MDCS businesses is relatively stable, as mold bases and hot runner systems have a short lead time from receipt of order to shipment with a global average of six to eight weeks; whereas spare parts sales of standard products are typically in stock and shipped with very little lead time. We do not track backlog in our Fluids segment as most orders are filled with minimal lead time. 
   
  Executive Overview  
  For the   third   quarter of   2016  , we reported sales of   $292.2 million  , operating earnings of   $29.1 million   and net earnings of   $6.7 million  .

Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $192.5 million   compared to   $191.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $1.1 million  , or   0.6%  .  Cost of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  574.5 million   compared to $  569.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of $  4.7 million  , or   0.8%  .  The increase for both periods is principally related to our acquisition of CanGen in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by our low-cost country and other cost reduction initiatives.  
   
  Manufacturing Margins 
  Our manufacturing margin (or gross margin) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $99.7 million   compared to   $101.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $1.6 million  , or   1.6%  . Our manufacturing margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $303.1 million   compared to   $303.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $0.3 million  , or   0.1%  . 
  The manufacturing margin as a percent of sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   34.1%   compared to   34.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and the manufacturing margin as a percent of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   34.5%   compared to   34.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  While the Company has realized material cost savings and benefits from cost reduction actions, these improvements were offset by the effects of competitive pricing pressure on sales.   
   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $60.3 million   compared to   $69.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $8.9 million  , or   12.9%  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were $  187.0 million   compared to $  207.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of $  20.5 million  , or   9.9%  .  The decreases are primarily related to our organizational redesign initiatives and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  In connection with our initial public offering ("IPO") in June 2015, we recognized an additional $11.3 million of stock-based compensation expense during the third quarter of 2015 associated with time-based and performance-based awards previously granted under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. These awards contained a market condition in which the vesting of the awards was accelerated upon the satisfaction of the market condition. Based upon the trading price of the Company's common stock subsequent to the IPO, the market condition was satisfied which resulted in the vesting of the awards in July 2015 and the Company's recognition of all previously unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with these awards. These reductions were partially offset by increased costs related to our acquisition of CanGen in the fourth quarter of 2015.    
   
  Amortization Expense 
  Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $7.8 million   compared to   $8.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $0.9 million  , or   10.3%  . Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was     $  23.5 million   compared to $  27.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,     a decrease of $  3.8 million  , or   13.9%  .     The decrease is primarily related to accelerated amortization methods on certain intangible assets subject to amortization as well as favorable foreign currency translation effects and was partially offset by amortization on certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of CanGen in the fourth quarter of   2015  . 
   
  (Gain) Loss on Currency Translation 
  The gain on currency translation for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.3 million   compared to a loss of   $8.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting in an favorable change of   $9.0 million  . The gain on currency translation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.3 million   compared to a loss of   $18.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting in a favorable change of   $26.9 million  . The gains and losses primarily relate to the non-cash translation impact on intercompany advances related to the Canadian dollar associated with the acquisition of Mold-Masters Luxembourg Holdings S.  r.l ("Mold-Masters") within our MDCS segment.

Other Expense, Net 
  Other expense, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.8 million   compared to   $3.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $0.9 million  . Other expense, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.1 million   compared to   $12.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $7.9 million  . The decrease was principally driven by expenses incurred in 2015 in connection with our organizational redesign initiatives in Europe as well as the $2.2 million impairment on certain trademarks incurred during the second quarter of 2015 which were discontinued as a result of a rebranding initiative.  
   
  Operating Earnings 
  Operating earnings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $29.1 million   compared to   $11.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of $  18.1 million  , or   164.5%  .  The increase is primarily attributable to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation when compared to the third quarter of 2015.  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized $11.3 million of additional stock-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of certain time-based and performance-based awards. 
  Operating earnings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were $  96.8 million   compared to $  38.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $58.8 million  , or   154.7%  . The increase in mainly attributable to the gains from currency translation, a reduction in stock-based compensation expense and a reduction in costs incurred related to our organizational redesign initiatives. 
   
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $15.2 million   compared to   $15.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $0.4 million  , or   2.6%  . Interest expense, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  45.6 million   compared to $  52.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , a decrease of $  6.8 million  , or   13.0%  . These decreases are primarily due to the decrease in our average indebtedness during 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  
   
  Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
  Loss on debt extinguishment was   $22.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The loss on debt extinguishment in 2015 was principally related to the   $13.8 million   premium paid upon the repayment of our   8.375%   senior secured notes due 2019 (the "Senior Secured Notes") as well as the related write-off of deferred financing costs during the period. 
   
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  7.2 million   compared to   $6.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $0.6 million  . Income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was $  21.8 million   compared to $  17.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $4.1 million  . Income tax expense for all periods was primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions paying cash taxes or where utilization of deferred tax assets was not offset by reversal of valuation allowances.  The increase in income tax expense is principally related to an increase in earnings and an increase in the tax rate at one of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries.   
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). To supplement this information, we also use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

Adjusted EBITDA    
  Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for the other items reflected in the reconciliation table set forth below. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to measure operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, is not a measure of financial condition or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use, as it does not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, debt service requirements and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. 
  We view Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA: 
     as a measurement used in evaluating our consolidated and segment-level operating performance on a consistent basis;  
     to calculate incentive compensation for our employees; 
     for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget; 
     to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and  
     to assess compliance with various metrics associated with our debt agreements. 
  We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is useful to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items as well as items considered to be one-time or non-recurring to the operations of the business. While we believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors, because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude other items as reflected in the reconciliation table below. 
  In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those used in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by usual or non-recurring items. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementary. 
  Adjusted Net Income    
  Adjusted Net Income measures our operating performance by adjusting net earnings (loss) to exclude amortization expense, non-cash currency effect on intercompany advances, organizational redesign costs, long-term equity awards and shareholder fees,  acquisition integration costs, professional services and certain other non-recurring items. Management uses this measure to evaluate our core operating results as it excludes certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the core operations of the business, but includes certain items such as depreciation, interest expense and income tax expense, which are otherwise excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We believe the presentation of Adjusted Net Income enhances our investors  overall understanding of the financial performance and cash flow of our business. You should not consider Adjusted Net Income as an alternative to net earnings (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.

    The annual effective tax rate adjustment primarily includes the impact to the tax provision utilizing the annual effective tax rate recomputed with anticipated tax rate reductions that have not been recognized for U.S. GAAP purposes as the Company is awaiting regulatory approval.  The reductions have historically been approved, or are expected to be approved, although there are no guarantees that the regulatory authorities will accept the Company s applications. In addition, the adjustment includes the impact of interim and intra-period tax expense and benefits that are expected to reverse in subsequent periods as well as the tax benefit associated with reconciling net earnings (loss) to Adjusted Net Income.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations and availability under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Facility") and other foreign credit facilities.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of $  102.7 million  , an increase of   $35.2 million   from   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $92.6 million   of availability under our ABL Facility and   $14.3 million   of availability under other credit facilities.  Our primary cash requirements are for working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of principal and interest. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated   $35.2 million   of cash compared to using   $7.0 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . During   2016  , cash provided by operations of $  60.8 million   was partially offset by capital expenditures. During   2015  , cash was used primarily to pay dividends, fund capital expenditures, working capital growth and redeem our Senior Secured Notes and our senior secured term loan due March 2020 (the "Term Loan Facility") offset by the proceeds from our IPO and New Term Loan Facility.

On April 30, 2012, we issued $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 30, 2012; the notes mature on May 15, 2019. On March 28, 2013, we (i) entered into an amended and restated senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and certain financial institutions as lenders; (ii) we issued $465.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior unsecured notes pursuant to an indenture; the notes mature on February 15, 2021 (the "Senior Unsecured Notes"); and (iii) we entered into the $245.0 million Term Loan Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain financial institutions as lenders. On May 14, 2015, we entered into the $730.0 million New Term Loan Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain financial institutions as lenders and used a portion of the proceeds to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and to redeem all of our outstanding Senior Secured Notes. 
  On June 30, 2015, we completed our IPO whereby the Company sold 14,285,714 shares of common stock at a price of $20.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the offering were $265.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to repay $248.0 million outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility and $14.1 million outstanding under the ABL Facility. 
  We believe that our current level of operations, our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our ABL Facility and other foreign lines of credit will provide us adequate cash to fund the operating needs, working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other requirements for our business for the foreseeable future.      Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness or to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other current obligations will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. Such cash generation is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control.  We have unused availability, subject to certain terms and conditions and other limitations, of   $106.9 million   under these lines of credit. 
  The following table shows our statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :       

Cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
  Operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   provided   $60.8 million   of cash compared to using   $5.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily driven by improvements in working capital including the collection of outstanding accounts receivable and an increase in advanced billings and deposits received.   
  Cash used in investing activities 
  Investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   used   $30.2 million   of cash compared to   $38.7 million   of cash for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is a result of a reduction in capital expenditures when compared to the prior period. 
  Cash provided by financing activities 
  Financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   provided   $3.6 million   compared to providing   $41.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cash was generated primarily from proceeds on the exercise of stock options offset by the repurchase of $0.6 million of our Senior Unsecured Notes.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , cash was generated from the proceeds of our IPO and the New Term Loan Facility, partially offset by the payment of dividends, the redemption of our Senior Secured Notes and Term Loan Facility and costs associated with our IPO. 
  Total debt was $  954.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to $  955.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Total debt at   September 30, 2016   included $  482.0 million   outstanding on the New Term Loan Facility and $  464.4 million   outstanding on the Senior Unsecured Notes, while the ABL Facility was undrawn except for letter of credit issuances.

Description of the New Term Loan Facility 
  On May 14, 2015, we entered into the New Term Loan Facility, pursuant to a term loan agreement, among Milacron Intermediate Holdings Inc., Milacron LLC, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.  The New Term Loan Facility matures on September 28, 2020.  The New Term Loan Facility ranks equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the issuers and guarantors.  The New Term Loan Facility is also secured by a second-priority lien on all of the assets of the Company, Milacron LLC and the guarantors that secure the ABL Facility.  The interest rate applicable to the New Term Loan Facility is, at our option, equal to either (i) the published LIBOR rate, plus a margin of, depending upon the current total net leverage ratio, 3.25% (if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00) to 3.50% (if our total net leverage ratio is greater than 4.00 to 1.00) per annum or (ii) the greater of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (3) published LIBOR rate plus 1.00% or (4) 2.00% per annum, plus, depending upon the current total net leverage ratio, 2.25% (if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00) to 2.50% (if our total net leverage ratio is greater than 4.00 to 1.00) per annum.  In no event will the LIBOR rate be less than 1.00% at any time.  The New Term Loan Facility provides us with the right, at any time, to request one or more incremental term increases in the aggregate amount (x) $200.0 million plus (y) an unlimited amount so long as our pro forma total net secured leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00 to 1.00 plus (z) the amount of any optional prepayment of any term loan under the New Term Loan Facility to the extent not funded with proceeds of any long-term indebtedness (other than revolving indebtedness) or proceeds of any incremental term facility that effectively extends the maturity date with respect to any class of term loans under the New Term Loan Facility.  The following amounts will be applied to repay the New Term Loan Facility, subject to certain thresholds, carve-outs and exceptions: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt by us and certain of our subsidiaries, (ii) 100% of net cash proceeds of any non-ordinary course sale or other disposition of assets by us or certain subsidiaries and (iii) 50% of our excess cash flow, subject to certain reductions. 
  As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, on June 30, 2015 we completed our IPO whereby the Company sold   14,285,714   shares of common stock at a price of   $20.00   per share.  The net proceeds, in part, were used to repay $  248.0 million   outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility. 
  Description of the Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On March 28, 2013, we issued $465.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes pursuant to an indenture, among the Company, Mcron Finance Corp, the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the  2013 Indenture ). The Senior Unsecured Notes mature on February 15, 2021 and interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  The Senior Unsecured Notes were issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by Milacron Holdings Corp. and each of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are obligors under our ABL Facility and New Term Loan Facility. The Senior Unsecured Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after February 15, 2016 on the redemption dates and at the redemption prices set forth in the 2013 Indenture. In addition, we may be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Unsecured Notes upon the sale of certain assets and upon a change of control.

Description of the ABL Facility 
  On April 30, 2012, we entered into the ABL Facility with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets and Barclays Bank PLC, as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners which was amended and restated on March 28, 2013.  The ABL Facility has a five-year term, bears interest at a floating rate and provides for an aggregate principal amount of $70.0 million of loans under the U.S. sub-facility thereunder and for an aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million of loans under the Canadian sub-facility thereunder, each subject to a borrowing base and other limitations.  We have the right at any time to request up to $20.0 million of additional commitments.  The existing lenders under the ABL Facility are not under any obligation to provide such additional commitments, and any increase in commitments is subject to customary conditions precedent. On March 17, 2014, we exercised our right to increase the U.S. sub-facility of the ABL Facility by $10.0 million to $80.0 million and decrease the Canadian sub-facility by $10.0 million to $20.0 million.  The covenants and other terms of the ABL Facility were not changed.  On October 17, 2014, the ABL Facility was amended and restated to add a $25.0 million German sub-facility and the term was reset to mature on February 14, 2019 or October 17, 2019 subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions on or prior to February 14, 2019.  The covenants and other terms of the ABL Facility were not materially changed.  On May 15, 2015, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility was amended and restated to, among other things, conform certain terms to the credit agreement governing the New Term Loan Facility. We had approximately   $12.3 million   of letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  The obligations under the ABL Facility are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the assets of the guarantors under such facility.  In addition, the ABL Facility includes certain customary negative covenants that, subject to exceptions, limit the ability of the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or certain other distributions on the Company s capital stock, repurchase the Company s capital stock, prepay subordinated indebtedness, incur liens on assets, make certain investments or other restricted payments, engage in transactions with affiliates, sell certain assets, merge or consolidate with or into other companies and alter the business that the Company conducts. 
  Description of Other Debt 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we have approximately   $0.5 million   in capital lease obligations outstanding as well as   $7.4 million   of borrowings under certain lines of credit     and discounting programs.  We also have approximately   $3.3 million   of outstanding letters of credit and other commitments related to these facilities at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  We prepare our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and in doing so, we have to make estimates, assumptions and judgments affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which, in turn, could change our results from those reported.  We evaluate our critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. 
    
  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those previously included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 2, 2016.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Market Risk 
  We are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and credit risk. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge our underlying exposure. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes and we have policies and procedures in place that monitor and control their use. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  We operate in international markets and, accordingly, our competitiveness and financial results are subject to foreign currency fluctuations where revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In fiscal   2015   and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately 51% and 53% of our sales were attributable to our operations outside of the United States, respectively. Approximately 43% of sales in fiscal   2015   were typically denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, whereas a significant portion of our fixed costs, including payments made on our ABL Facility, our New Term Loan Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our earnings could be materially impacted particularly by movement in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the Chinese yuan renminbi, the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. 
  We occasionally use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to known or expected cash flow exposures arising from international transactions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had $15.0 million and $16.2 million, respectively, notional amount of forward exchange contracts outstanding with remaining maturities of up to six months. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was and $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The fair value of these financial instruments would hypothetically decrease by $1.5 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10% of current levels.  
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk through our ABL Facility, New Term Loan Facility, and other foreign lines of credit. Interest on our ABL Facility accrues, at our option, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.25% per annum, based on availability or (ii) the highest rate of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum, plus a margin of 0.75% to 1.25% per annum, based on availability. Interest on the New Term Loan Facility accrues, at our option, equal to either (i) the published LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 3.25% (if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00) or 3.50% (if our total net leverage ratio is greater than 4.00 to 1.00) per annum or (ii) the greater of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (3) published LIBOR rate plus 1.0% or (4) 2.00% per annum, plus 2.25% (if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00) or 2.50% (if our total net leverage ratio is greater than 4.00 to 1.00) per annum. In no event will the LIBOR rate be less than 1.00% at any time. We currently estimate that our annual interest expense on floating rate indebtedness would increase by approximately $4.8 million for each 1.00% increase in interest rates once LIBOR exceeds 1.00%. 
  Commodity Risk 
  We have direct and indirect exposure to certain commodities, principally steel and steel-based components. We typically do not enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge our commodity price risk and we do not currently have long-term supply contracts with key suppliers. While future movements of steel costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic steel purchases and customer price adjustments.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or which are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Various lawsuits arising during the normal course of business are pending against us and our consolidated subsidiaries. We are vigorously defending these claims and believe we have reserves and insurance coverage sufficient to cover potential exposures. 
  While, in the opinion of management, the liability resulting from these matters will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the outcome of individual matters cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty at this time.

  Works Agreement on 
  Balance of Interest and Social Plan 
    
  Between 
    
  Ferromatik Milacron GmbH  , represented by the Managing Director Denis Poelman, Riegler  Str. 4, 79364 Malterdingen 
  - hereinafter  Company   - 
    
  and the 
    
  Works Council of Ferromatik Milacron GmbH  , represented by ist Chairman Mathias Rombach,  Riegler Str. 4, 79364 Malterdingen 
  - hereinafter  Works Council   - 
    
  the following Works Agreement on a Balance of Interests and a Social Plan shall be concluded: 
    
  Preambel 
  The Company has been lossmaking for more than ten years. Despite the measures taken in recent years with the support of the employees and the business resources of the Milacron group  a sustainable economic recovery has not occurred. Against this background, the Parties are aware of the need for a change in the business model . The Parties have discussed a restructuring concept, which provides for the closure of certain production areas to avoid further losses and for the integration of its remaining business in the global Milacron organization. 
    
           I. 
    General Provisions 
              1. 
    Applicability 
              (1) 
    The Works Agreement on balance of interests and social plan is considered an integrated legal document with all its annexes and shall be applicable to all employees as defined in sec. 5 para. 1 WCA, who at the date of signature of the Works Agreement remain in an unterminated employment contract with Ferromatik and who are affected by the operational measures. All rules apply in the case of termination of employment regardless of whether the termination is done  
     
   Version prepared for signature (German Version Corntrolling 

2 

through a redundancy notice / notice to amend the contractual terms, through a termination agreement, through a tripartite agreement  with the transfer company a+ b. Resignations announced before the conclusion of this Agreement shall be deemed to not be caused by the employer.  
           (2) 
    This Works Agreement shall not apply to 
        Management Employees as defined in sec 5 para. 3 WCA  
           (3) 
    The following employees shall not be qualified for measures of compensation or mitigation for loss of employment: 
              Employees whose employment is terminated for individual, capacity related or conduct related reasons, 
           Employees whose employment ends due to expiry of a fixed term, 
           Employees who could receive a regular retirement pension at the end of their employment, regardless for the reason of such termination (settlement, dismissal, fixed term).  
           2. 
    Conclusion of the consultation and negotiation 
              (1) 
    Negotiations on the balancing of interests and social plan concerning the announced operational changes have been completed with the signing of this agreement. The parties agree that the operational change in this balance of interests is described completely and correctly and that the process of achieving a balance of interests in accordance with secc 111, 112 WCA is concluded. This also applies to the extent that changes in the implementation of the project change based solely on insignificant amendments of project schedules or on purely technical provisions, which  trigger not more than one month delay in compliance with the notice period for the affected worker. 
              (2) 
    The advisory procedure pursuant to sec. 17 KSchG is also completed. The Company has informed the Works Council about all data provided in sec. 17 para. 2 KSchG in writing. Therefore this agreement is at the same time the final and complete consultation declaration of the Works Councils about the measures envisaged within the meaning of sec. 17 para. 2 KSchG. 
              II. 
    Balance of Interest 
              1. 
    Implementation of the Project 
     To implement the measures of the Project all jobs in the following departments and labour groups shall be eliminated as listed hereinafter: 
             
    Restructuring of the departments warehouse, goods entry and sending, aftermarket backoffice, whereby the jobs shall be transferred from Q 4 2016 into the already existing warehouse and logistic centre in  a ovice for spare parts and into the site at Policka for assembly parts. 
                
    Closure of the department assembly insofar as all assembly related activities shall be transferred into other sites of Milacron, in particular to Policka; 
                
    Closure of the department machining, whereby all machining activities shall be taken over by other sites of Milacron, in particular in the Czech Republic. 

3 

The updated planning for the warehouse for spare parts and customers and the backoffice is attached including a final name list for Q4 2016 as   Annex 1  . 
  The planning for the departments assembly and machining is attached in its current format as explained to the works council on 28 September 2016 for assembly in   Annex 2   and for Machinig in   Annex 3  , whereby these schedules may be changed until 15 December 2016. 
  The Company will take the necessary organizational measures according to the project plan and the name list to terminate the concerned employment contracts. In case of a scheduled end of employment at 31 December 2016 Ferromatik shall provide employees already in October 2016 with the three-party-agreement or a notice letter, in all other cases the agreements to transfer into the Transfer Company shall be offered or notice letters may be given until 15 December 2016 at the latest. 
           2. 
    Cooperation and Support to implement the operational change 
     The implementation of the operational change requires the cooperation and support of all employees. Considering the fact that the entitlements provided by this Agreement would not be affordable unless by funding through the Milacron group (shareholder of the Company), the Works Council will cooperate with the employer to implement the operational change in a supportive manner. However, the Parties agree that the consultation rights of the Works Councils are not consumed. Should employees who are on the names list and do not enter in the transfer company receive from Ferromatik a dismissal for operational reasons, the Works Council herewith already confirms his consent for the termination date listed in the name list  in accordance with sec. 102 WCA.  
           3. 
    Provisions to avoid or delay redundancies 
     As a result of operational measures up to 120 workers will be affected by the elimination of their jobs in Malterdingen. All employees affected by a job loss and subject to this Agreement are listed in   Annex 4   (list of names) and marked with the date of their exit from Ferromatik.  Should this list change until the 15. December 2016   Annex 4   shall be replaced by the then binding list. If the list is not replaced the current list shall become final. 
  Ferromatik will advertise free positions within the site and will prioritize employees with same qualification if they are listed on   Annex 4  . If an employee is transferred to a free employment position he will be removed from the list   Annex 4  . 
  Employees who have an interest to delay their individual redundancy date may swap their leaving date from the Company with another colleague provided the employee has the same qualifications and skills, and the employer recognizes the equivalence of the qualification and skill of said employees. 
  As far as operational needs exist, the Company may request from the employee concerned a onetime change of the termination date specified in   Annex 4   by one month, provided the requested change of the exit date has been notified at least three months before the intended date of termination to the  

4 

employee and the transfer company a + b in writing. Any further amendment requires the consent of the employee concerned voluntarily given and is only possible if the subsequent termination of employment falls on a quarter end date (regular entry date in the transfer company). Employees whose effective end date shall be moved by one month with a minimum notice period of three months may request that the initially notified date remains, if they have already signed a new employment contract commencing on the initially scheduled time of release. The Company may request proof.  
  Employees are entitled to declare a unilateral notice to a date which is one month before the termination date specified in the name list, if they can proof formation of a new employment contract. Here a shortened notice period of one month to the end of a month shall apply. In this case, the entitlements under the social plan will remain unchanged. This does not apply if there are facts, due to which the employer, considering all the circumstances, cannot be expected to agree to the premature termination, whereby organizational measures are considered reasonable for the employer. Resignations, which will take effect before this date, lead to the exclusion from the social plan. 
    
  As effective dates for the termination of employment the following dates are fixed in the name list (  Annex 4)  : 
    
  1. Release date 31.12.2016 
  2. Release date 31.03.2016 
  3. Release date 30.06.2017 
  4. Release date 30.09.2017 
  5. Release date 31.12.2017 
  6. Release date 31.03.2018 
    
  4. Cooperation in the transfer of the site Malterdingen at the current site 
  For all employees at the site Malterdingen the contractual obligations under their respective employment contract shall remain in force. If employees from the Czech Republic are to be trained in Malterdingen, the site's employees may therefore not hold back their knowledge and skills. All employees are obliged under their contractual obligations to contribute supportive measures for training of the Czech workers or any potential service providers during their normal working hours and their regular contractual activity.  
  5.  Obligation to work posting for know-how transfer out of Malterdingen 
           (1) 
    Where a posting abroad for know-how transfer (coaching) is required from employees outside of Malterdingen, the Company shall be obliged to consider out of the group of suitable employees which employees are more than slightly impaired because of their personal challenging  

5 

environment. Single parents and employees  with caretaking or nursing obligations at home shall not be approached. The Company shall ensure an equal posting schedule between several equally suitable employees, thereby considering personal preferences of employees. There shall be a notice of at least one full working week between announcement and the beginning of a posting abroad.  
           (2) 
    Assignments to implement the operational change abroad cannot be unilaterally ordered by the Employer under the employment contract's right to give instructions. All work assignments on the implementation of operational changes outside of Malterdingen which are connected with an overnight stay, are voluntary and require the express consent of the employee concerned. 
              (3) 
    The Company shall provide employees who consent to postings, in addition to the payment of the travel times and the working hours and the travel cost and expense in accordance with the purpose of the guidelines as published by the Company (  Annex 5  ) and additionally a know-how transfer premium of   40,00 per calendar day of the mission to strengthen the motivation for foreign travel assignments. 
              (4) 
    Additionally all tariff and company and individual agreements concerning the payment and charges for overtime, late and night work shall apply to this external work as well. 
              III. 
    Social Plan 
     1.        This social plan shall provide employees eligible to receive benefits with compensatory amounts and mitigate the adverse effects arising from operational changes as described in the balance of interests Agreement above. 
  2.        Employees are entitled to the provisions "compensation for younger workers" or "compensation for older workers", provided the employment relationship ends due to the measures agreed in the balance of interests due to dismissal, notice for change of terms or overtaking resignation as defined in section I.1. or an amicable termination. 
           3. 
    Compensation for younger workers 
     Younger Workers are employees who are younger than 60 years old at the time oft the effective termination of employment. 
           (1) 
    Younger workers recieve a severance payment according to the following formula: 
     Service time in years    muliplied by 0.75 (factor)   mulitiplied by 1/12 annual salary = basic severance pay 
  definitions: 
  Years for age and continued service shall be counted on full numbers without any rounding as of 31.12.2016. 
  The gross annual salary 2016 shall be the average of the months June, July and August 2016 multiplied with 13.3 divided by 12 for tariff employees, for non-tariff employees the average salary of the months June, July and August 2016 shall apply. One-time payments, payment for overtime, or other specific developments like unpaid vacation, long term sickness or any other  

6 

circumstance shall not be regarded. All other payment components like e.g. ERA compensation, additional payments (type 1 - 3), premiums and voluntary premiums, performance premiums, tariff and out of tariff bonus payments and potentially amounts that were paid to a deferred compensation scheme shall be included in the gross salary. A potential company car shall be counted at the value of the taxable benefit without kilometers for the way to work. 
   If the taxcode data provides not for all children (e.g. 2 child mounts  - 4 children), the employee shall receive for each additional child an additional child allowance, but only on provision of proof to be provided to the HR department until 31.12.206. 
  Recognized disabled employees, who have announced thier disabled status to the employer, shall receive:          with at least 50 degree disabled status an allowance of           4.000,00; 
  with at least 30 degree disabled status an allowance of           2.000,00. 
   The individual severance per employee is capped to a maximum of   130.000,00 for each employee, this shall include all social allowances. 
           4. 
    Compensation for older workers 
     Older workers are employees who on the date of the legal termination of service pursuant to the preceding measures (para. 2) the age of 60 have already been completed. 
  Older Workers shall receive  a severance payment (one lumpsum, which is calculated as the sum of three compensation awards) which is calculated as follows: 
           (1) 
    Compensation award  I  
     Difference between the unemployment benefit I and 90% of individual net salaries (including all allowancees)   multiplied by number of months until earliest retirement  after ending of employment in the transfer company. 
  This calculation shall apply regardless of the employee receiving de facto  unemployment benefits or joining the transfer company. 
  The compensatory award I shall be paid excluding periods of transfer company and unemployment benefit. It shall be paid for a maximum of 24 months (12 months transfer company + 24 months unemployment benefit and increased pay by the employer equals normal retirement pension). Disability pensions and pension rights of particularly long time employees shall remain excluded in the calculation. 
  The calculation of net amounts shall use the rules for calculation of unemployment benefits I. For calculation of unemployment benefits and net salary the unemployment calculator published online under Bundesagentur f r Arbeit (http://www.pub.arbeitsagentur.de/selbst.php?jahr=2016) shall be used. 

7 

(2) 
    Compensation Award II 
     Further to the Compensation Award II Older Workers shall receive a compensation for pension reductions. This is calculated as follows:  
  Individual pension deduction (in%) due to early pension access in the month after reaching 63 years of age x general monthly pension of   1,500.00 x number of months until they reach the age of 80 = Compensation Award II. 
           (3) 
    Compensation Award III 
     The sum of Compansation Award I and Compensation Award II has to be increased by a general tax markup of 33%  (Calculation: Award I + Award II = Sum* 0,33 = Award III). 
           (4) 
    Aggregate Compensation Awards 
     The total amount of severance pay for older workers arises from the sum of the compensatory awards I, II and III as well as any given social allowance under. II 2 (2) (children and severely disabled surcharges). 
   The individual severance per employee is capped to a maximum of   130.000,00 for each employee, this shall include all social allowances. 
   All severance payments are due with final payroll before the effective end of employment. Employees requesting in the 4th quarter of the year, that the compensation is not paid off in the current year, but the following year with the January settlement, the Company will meet this desire.  
           5. 
    Transfer Company 
     To avoid unemployment and to further reduce the disadvantages associated with the project the Company offers to all employees affected by the project and who are listed on the name list, Appendix 1, the transition to a transfer company for a period of 12 months from the transfer date announced. 
  The Agreement on the Establishing of a Transfer Company shall provide further details. The individual claim is governed by the Tripartite Agreement between the Company, the employees and the transfer company.  
           6. 
    Provisions in accompanying CBA 
     A company related collective bargaining agreement (CBA) shall be agreed to ensure the effectiveness of the measures and the equal-treatment of employees. Under the rules of the CBA special protection against dismissal will be temporarily removed in the period from 01.10.2016 to 31.12.2016. Sec 4.4 collective agreement for workers in the metal industry in South Baden is repealed. The Works Council has granted his consent to measures of termination of employment with regard to the employees listed  

8 

on the list of names  (sec. 102 para. 2 WCA) and to comply with the provisions of this agreement to amend the exit dates ( sec 102 para. 6 WCA). 
           7. 
    General Provisions 
              (1) 
    Long Service Awards 
     Employees who would celebrate a long term service award within 12 months after effective termination of employment shall receive the jubilee premium under the existing works agreement. 
           (1) 
    Notice of dismissal  /  Handover of 3- Partite -  Contracts 
     The Company shall hand over countersigned termination agreements / 3-partite contracts. In case of the planned termination in December 2016 handover occurs at the latest in October 2016 and in all other cases, no later than 15 December. This shall happen to provide the affected employees with security for their further long term planning. The termination to employees who do not join the transfer company will take place in the period from 1 October 2016 until 15.12.2016. 
           (2)

              (b)

              (a)

              (c) 
    This Agreement sets forth exclusively the duties of Vendor's Counsel with respect to any and all matters pertinent thereto. Vendor's Counsel shall not be bound to refer to, and shall not be bound by, the provisions of any other agreement other than the terms of this Agreement. Vendor's Counsel will not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement, except for its own gross negligence and/or intentional fault. In the event that Vendor's Counsel shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder, or should it receive instructions, claims or demands from any of the parties hereto or from third persons with respect to the Deposit held hereunder which in its opinion are in conflict with any provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action (other than  

-  3  - 

to keep safely the Deposit held hereunder) until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by all the parties hereto, and said third persons, if any, or by final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

    If the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not completed for any reason other than the sole default of the Purchaser, the Deposit, together with all interest accrued thereon, shall be returned to the Purchaser forthwith without deduction or set off.  If the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not completed solely as a result of the default of the Purchaser, the Vendor shall be entitled to retain the Deposit, together with all interest accrued thereon, as liquidated damages, the whole without any further recourse between the Vendor and the Purchaser.  The Vendor's Counsel is hereby authorized and directed to pay the Deposit, together with all interest accrued thereon, in the manner contemplated by this Section 1.2

-  4  - 

or unwilling to remove prior to the Closing Date and which the Purchaser will not waive, this Agreement will, notwithstanding any intermediate acts or negotiations in respect of such objections, be null and void, and the Deposit together with interest, if any, that has accrued thereon will be returned to the Purchaser without deduction.  Save as to any valid objections so made and save as to any objections going to the root of title and any encumbrances arising after the Acceptance Date that are not attributable to the act or omission of the Tenant, the Purchaser will be conclusively deemed to have accepted the title of the Vendor to the Properties.
